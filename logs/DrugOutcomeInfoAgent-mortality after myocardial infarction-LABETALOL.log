[31mlabetalol should be stopped and not restarted. Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure. Beta-blockade carries a [0m
[31mpotential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, [0m
[31mlabetalol HCl can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are well compensated. Congestive heart failure has been observed in patients receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol [0m

[31mmyocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. LABETALOL: warnings: At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should [0m
[31mbe fully digitalized and/or be given a diuretic, and the response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and diuretic, therapy with labetalol [0m

[31moccurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered labetalol hydrochloride tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage [0m

[31mtherapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients [0m
[31mshould be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to [0m

[31mantihypertensive agents. LABETALOL: warnings: It is prudent, if labetalol hydrochloride tablets are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous [0m
[31mbeta-agonists is minimized. Pheochromocytoma: Labetalol HCl has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure and relieving symptoms in patients with pheochromocytoma. However, paradoxical [0m
[31mhypertensive responses have been reported in a few patients with this tumor; therefore, use caution when administering labetalol HCl to patients with pheochromocytoma. Diabetes Mellitus and [0m

[31mhepatic events have been reported with a related research compound, dilevalol HCl, including two deaths. Dilevalol HCl is one of the four isomers of labetalol HCl. Thus, for patients taking labetalol,[0m
[31mperiodic determination of suitable hepatic laboratory tests would be appropriate. Appropriate laboratory testing should be done at the first symptom/sign of liver dysfunction [0m[1;31m([0m[31me.g., pruritus, dark [0m

[31mlabetalol should be stopped and not restarted. Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure. Beta-blockade carries a [0m
[31mpotential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, [0m
[31mlabetalol HCl can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are well compensated. Congestive heart failure has been observed in patients receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol [0m
[31mHCl does not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure : In patients with latent cardiac insufficiency, continued depression of the [0m
[31mmyocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. LABETALOL: warnings: At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should [0m
[31mbe fully digitalized and/or be given a diuretic, and the response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and diuretic, therapy with labetalol [0m

[31moccurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered labetalol hydrochloride tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage [0m
[31mshould be gradually reduced over a period of [0m[1;31m1[0m[31m to [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. LABETALOL: warnings: If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, [0m
[31mtherapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients [0m
[31mshould be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to [0m

[31mantihypertensive agents. LABETALOL: warnings: It is prudent, if labetalol hydrochloride tablets are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous [0m

[31mlabetalol should be stopped and not restarted. Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure. Beta-blockade carries a [0m

[31mtherapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients [0m
