        Below are some relevant extracts for your query:
        -----
        
CONTENT: LABETALOL: precautions: Drugs possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of beta-receptor agonist drugs in patients with bronchospasm; therefore, doses greater 
than the normal antiasthmatic dose of beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs may be required. Cimetidine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of labetalol HCl. Since this could be explained 
either by enhanced absorption or by an alteration of hepatic metabolism of labetalol HCl, special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients. 
Synergism has been shown between halothane anesthesia and intravenously administered labetalol HCl. LABETALOL: precautions: During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using labetalol HCl in association 
with halothane, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac 
output and an increase in central venous pressure. The anesthesiologist should be informed when a patient is receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol HCl blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by 
nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effect. If labetalol HCl is used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional antihypertensive effects may occur. Care should be 
taken if labetalol is used concomitantly with calcium antagonists of the verapamil type. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. 
LABETALOL: precautions: comitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a 
variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat 
allergic reaction. Drug & OR Laboratory Test Interactions The presence of labetalol metabolites in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary catecholamines, metanephrine, 
normetanephrine, and vanillylmandelic acid when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods. In screening patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma and being treated with labetalol HCl, a 
specific method, such as a high performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction (e.g. LABETALOL: precautions: J Chromatogr 385:241,1987) should be employed in determining levels 
of catecholamines. Labetalol HCl has also been reported to produce a false-positive test for amphetamine when screening urine for the presence of drugs using the commercially available assay methods 
Toxi-Lab A ® (thin-layer chromatographic assay) and Emit-d.a.u ® (radioenzymatic assay). When patients being treated with labetalol have a positive urine test for amphetamine using these techniques, 
confirmation should be made by using more specific methods, such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique. Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Long-term oral dosing 
studies with labetalol HCl for 18 months in mice and for 2 years in rats showed no evidence of carcinogenesis. LABETALOL: precautions: Studies with labetalol HCl using dominant lethal assays in rats 
and mice and exposing microorganisms according to modified Ames tests showed no evidence of mutagenesis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C: Teratogenic studies were performed with 
labetalol in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to approximately six and four times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. No reproducible evidence of fetal malformations was 
observed. Increased fetal resorptions were seen in both species at doses approximating the MRHD. A teratology study performed with labetalol in rabbits at IV doses up to 1.7 times the MRHD revealed no
evidence of drug related harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Labetalol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus. LABETALOL: precautions: Nonteratogenic Effects: Hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression have been reported in infants of mothers who were 
treated with labetalol HCl for hypertension during pregnancy. Oral administration of labetalol to rats during late gestation through weaning at doses of two to four times the MRHD caused a decrease in
neonatal survival. Labor & Delivery Labetalol HCl given to pregnant women with hypertension did not appear to affect the usual course of labor and delivery. Nursing Mothers Small amounts of labetalol 
(approximately 0.004% of the maternal dose) are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when labetalol hydrochloride tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and 
effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. LABETALOL: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use As in the general population, some elderly patients (60 years of age and older) have experienced 
orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, or lightheadedness during treatment with labetalol. Because elderly patients are generally more likely than younger patients to experience orthostatic symptoms, 
they should be cautioned about the possibility of such side effects during treatment with labetalol.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: warnings: WARNINGS Hepatic Injury: Severe hepatocellular injury, confirmed by rechallenge in at least one case, occurs rarely with labetalol therapy.The hepatic injury is usually 
reversible, but hepatic necrosis and death have been reported. Injury has occurred after both short- and long-term treatment and may be slowly progressive despite minimal symptomatology. Similar 
hepatic events have been reported with a related research compound, dilevalol HCl, including two deaths. Dilevalol HCl is one of the four isomers of labetalol HCl. Thus, for patients taking labetalol,
periodic determination of suitable hepatic laboratory tests would be appropriate. Appropriate laboratory testing should be done at the first symptom/sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark 
urine, persistent anorexia, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained "flu-like" symptoms). LABETALOL: warnings: If the patient has laboratory evidence of liver injury or jaundice, 
labetalol should be stopped and not restarted. Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure. Beta-blockade carries a 
potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, 
labetalol HCl can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are well compensated. Congestive heart failure has been observed in patients receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol 
HCl does not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure : In patients with latent cardiac insufficiency, continued depression of the 
myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. LABETALOL: warnings: At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should 
be fully digitalized and/or be given a diuretic, and the response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and diuretic, therapy with labetalol 
hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn (gradually, if possible). Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal: Angina pectoris has not been reported upon labetalol HCl 
discontinuation. However, hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have 
occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered labetalol hydrochloride tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage 
should be gradually reduced over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. LABETALOL: warnings: If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, 
therapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients 
should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to 
discontinue therapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets abruptly in patients being treated for hypertension. Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema): Patients with 
bronchospastic disease should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Labetalol hydrochloride tablets may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other 
antihypertensive agents. LABETALOL: warnings: It is prudent, if labetalol hydrochloride tablets are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous 
beta-agonists is minimized. Pheochromocytoma: Labetalol HCl has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure and relieving symptoms in patients with pheochromocytoma. However, paradoxical 
hypertensive responses have been reported in a few patients with this tumor; therefore, use caution when administering labetalol HCl to patients with pheochromocytoma. Diabetes Mellitus and 
Hypoglycemia: Beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent the appearance of premonitory signs and symptoms (e.g., tachycardia) of acute hypoglycemia. This is especially important with labile diabetics.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking labetalol HCl in combination with tricyclic antidepressants experienced tremor, as compared to 0.7% 
reported to occur with labetalol HCl alone. The contribution of each of the treatments to this adverse reaction is unknown, but the possibility of a drug interaction cannot be excluded. Drugs 
possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of beta-receptor agonist drugs in patients with bronchospasm; therefore, doses greater than the normal antiasthmatic dose of 
beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs may be required. Cimetidine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of labetalol HCl. Since this could be explained either by enhanced absorption or by an

may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.

may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: precautions: Drugs possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of beta-receptor agonist drugs in patients with bronchospasm; therefore, doses greater 
than the normal antiasthmatic dose of beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs may be required. Cimetidine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of labetalol HCl. Since this could be explained 
either by enhanced absorption or by an alteration of hepatic metabolism of labetalol HCl, special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients. 
Synergism has been shown between halothane anesthesia and intravenously administered labetalol HCl. LABETALOL: precautions: During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using labetalol HCl in association 
with halothane, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac 
output and an increase in central venous pressure. The anesthesiologist should be informed when a patient is receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol HCl blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by 
nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effect. If labetalol HCl is used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional antihypertensive effects may occur. Care should be 
taken if labetalol is used concomitantly with calcium antagonists of the verapamil type. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. 
LABETALOL: precautions: comitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a 
variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat 
allergic reaction. Drug & OR Laboratory Test Interactions The presence of labetalol metabolites in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary catecholamines, metanephrine, 
normetanephrine, and vanillylmandelic acid when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods. In screening patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma and being treated with labetalol HCl, a 
specific method, such as a high performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction (e.g. LABETALOL: precautions: J Chromatogr 385:241,1987) should be employed in determining levels 
of catecholamines. Labetalol HCl has also been reported to produce a false-positive test for amphetamine when screening urine for the presence of drugs using the commercially available assay methods 
Toxi-Lab A ® (thin-layer chromatographic assay) and Emit-d.a.u ® (radioenzymatic assay). When patients being treated with labetalol have a positive urine test for amphetamine using these techniques, 
confirmation should be made by using more specific methods, such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique. Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Long-term oral dosing 
studies with labetalol HCl for 18 months in mice and for 2 years in rats showed no evidence of carcinogenesis. LABETALOL: precautions: Studies with labetalol HCl using dominant lethal assays in rats 
and mice and exposing microorganisms according to modified Ames tests showed no evidence of mutagenesis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C: Teratogenic studies were performed with 
labetalol in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to approximately six and four times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. No reproducible evidence of fetal malformations was 
observed. Increased fetal resorptions were seen in both species at doses approximating the MRHD. A teratology study performed with labetalol in rabbits at IV doses up to 1.7 times the MRHD revealed no
evidence of drug related harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Labetalol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus. LABETALOL: precautions: Nonteratogenic Effects: Hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression have been reported in infants of mothers who were 
treated with labetalol HCl for hypertension during pregnancy. Oral administration of labetalol to rats during late gestation through weaning at doses of two to four times the MRHD caused a decrease in
neonatal survival. Labor & Delivery Labetalol HCl given to pregnant women with hypertension did not appear to affect the usual course of labor and delivery. Nursing Mothers Small amounts of labetalol 
(approximately 0.004% of the maternal dose) are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when labetalol hydrochloride tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and 
effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. LABETALOL: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use As in the general population, some elderly patients (60 years of age and older) have experienced 
orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, or lightheadedness during treatment with labetalol. Because elderly patients are generally more likely than younger patients to experience orthostatic symptoms, 
they should be cautioned about the possibility of such side effects during treatment with labetalol.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: warnings: WARNINGS Hepatic Injury: Severe hepatocellular injury, confirmed by rechallenge in at least one case, occurs rarely with labetalol therapy.The hepatic injury is usually 
reversible, but hepatic necrosis and death have been reported. Injury has occurred after both short- and long-term treatment and may be slowly progressive despite minimal symptomatology. Similar 
hepatic events have been reported with a related research compound, dilevalol HCl, including two deaths. Dilevalol HCl is one of the four isomers of labetalol HCl. Thus, for patients taking labetalol,
periodic determination of suitable hepatic laboratory tests would be appropriate. Appropriate laboratory testing should be done at the first symptom/sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark 
urine, persistent anorexia, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained "flu-like" symptoms). LABETALOL: warnings: If the patient has laboratory evidence of liver injury or jaundice, 
labetalol should be stopped and not restarted. Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure. Beta-blockade carries a 
potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, 
labetalol HCl can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are well compensated. Congestive heart failure has been observed in patients receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol 
HCl does not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure : In patients with latent cardiac insufficiency, continued depression of the 
myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. LABETALOL: warnings: At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should 
be fully digitalized and/or be given a diuretic, and the response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and diuretic, therapy with labetalol 
hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn (gradually, if possible). Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal: Angina pectoris has not been reported upon labetalol HCl 
discontinuation. However, hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have 
occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered labetalol hydrochloride tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage 
should be gradually reduced over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. LABETALOL: warnings: If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, 
therapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients 
should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to 
discontinue therapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets abruptly in patients being treated for hypertension. Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema): Patients with 
bronchospastic disease should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Labetalol hydrochloride tablets may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other 
antihypertensive agents. LABETALOL: warnings: It is prudent, if labetalol hydrochloride tablets are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous 
beta-agonists is minimized. Pheochromocytoma: Labetalol HCl has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure and relieving symptoms in patients with pheochromocytoma. However, paradoxical 
hypertensive responses have been reported in a few patients with this tumor; therefore, use caution when administering labetalol HCl to patients with pheochromocytoma. Diabetes Mellitus and 
Hypoglycemia: Beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent the appearance of premonitory signs and symptoms (e.g., tachycardia) of acute hypoglycemia. This is especially important with labile diabetics.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking labetalol HCl in combination with tricyclic antidepressants experienced tremor, as compared to 0.7% 
reported to occur with labetalol HCl alone. The contribution of each of the treatments to this adverse reaction is unknown, but the possibility of a drug interaction cannot be excluded. Drugs 
possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of beta-receptor agonist drugs in patients with bronchospasm; therefore, doses greater than the normal antiasthmatic dose of 
beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs may be required. Cimetidine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of labetalol HCl. Since this could be explained either by enhanced absorption or by an 
alteration of hepatic metabolism of labetalol HCl, special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients. LABETALOL: drug_interactions: Synergism

either by enhanced absorption or by an alteration of hepatic metabolism of labetalol HCl, special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients. 
Synergism has been shown between halothane anesthesia and intravenously administered labetalol HCl. LABETALOL: precautions: During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using labetalol HCl in association 
with halothane, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac 
output and an increase in central venous pressure. The anesthesiologist should be informed when a patient is receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol HCl blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by 
nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effect. If labetalol HCl is used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional antihypertensive effects may occur. Care should be 
taken if labetalol is used concomitantly with calcium antagonists of the verapamil type. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. 
LABETALOL: precautions: comitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a 
variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat 
allergic reaction. Drug & OR Laboratory Test Interactions The presence of labetalol metabolites in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary catecholamines, metanephrine, 
normetanephrine, and vanillylmandelic acid when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods. In screening patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma and being treated with labetalol HCl, a 
specific method, such as a high performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction (e.g. LABETALOL: precautions: J Chromatogr 385:241,1987) should be employed in determining levels 
of catecholamines. Labetalol HCl has also been reported to produce a false-positive test for amphetamine when screening urine for the presence of drugs using the commercially available assay methods 
Toxi-Lab A ® (thin-layer chromatographic assay) and Emit-d.a.u ® (radioenzymatic assay). When patients being treated with labetalol have a positive urine test for amphetamine using these techniques, 
confirmation should be made by using more specific methods, such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique. Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Long-term oral dosing 
studies with labetalol HCl for 18 months in mice and for 2 years in rats showed no evidence of carcinogenesis. LABETALOL: precautions: Studies with labetalol HCl using dominant lethal assays in rats 
and mice and exposing microorganisms according to modified Ames tests showed no evidence of mutagenesis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C: Teratogenic studies were performed with 
labetalol in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to approximately six and four times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. No reproducible evidence of fetal malformations was 
observed. Increased fetal resorptions were seen in both species at doses approximating the MRHD. A teratology study performed with labetalol in rabbits at IV doses up to 1.7 times the MRHD revealed no
evidence of drug related harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Labetalol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus. LABETALOL: precautions: Nonteratogenic Effects: Hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression have been reported in infants of mothers who were 
treated with labetalol HCl for hypertension during pregnancy. Oral administration of labetalol to rats during late gestation through weaning at doses of two to four times the MRHD caused a decrease in
neonatal survival. Labor & Delivery Labetalol HCl given to pregnant women with hypertension did not appear to affect the usual course of labor and delivery. Nursing Mothers Small amounts of labetalol 
(approximately 0.004% of the maternal dose) are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when labetalol hydrochloride tablets are administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and 
effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. LABETALOL: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use As in the general population, some elderly patients (60 years of age and older) have experienced 
orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, or lightheadedness during treatment with labetalol. Because elderly patients are generally more likely than younger patients to experience orthostatic symptoms, 
they should be cautioned about the possibility of such side effects during treatment with labetalol.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: warnings: WARNINGS Hepatic Injury: Severe hepatocellular injury, confirmed by rechallenge in at least one case, occurs rarely with labetalol therapy.The hepatic injury is usually 
reversible, but hepatic necrosis and death have been reported. Injury has occurred after both short- and long-term treatment and may be slowly progressive despite minimal symptomatology. Similar 
hepatic events have been reported with a related research compound, dilevalol HCl, including two deaths. Dilevalol HCl is one of the four isomers of labetalol HCl. Thus, for patients taking labetalol,
periodic determination of suitable hepatic laboratory tests would be appropriate. Appropriate laboratory testing should be done at the first symptom/sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark 
urine, persistent anorexia, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained "flu-like" symptoms). LABETALOL: warnings: If the patient has laboratory evidence of liver injury or jaundice, 
labetalol should be stopped and not restarted. Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure. Beta-blockade carries a 
potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, 
labetalol HCl can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are well compensated. Congestive heart failure has been observed in patients receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol 
HCl does not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure : In patients with latent cardiac insufficiency, continued depression of the 
myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. LABETALOL: warnings: At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should 
be fully digitalized and/or be given a diuretic, and the response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and diuretic, therapy with labetalol 
hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn (gradually, if possible). Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal: Angina pectoris has not been reported upon labetalol HCl 
discontinuation. However, hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have 
occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered labetalol hydrochloride tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage 
should be gradually reduced over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. LABETALOL: warnings: If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, 
therapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients 
should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to 
discontinue therapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets abruptly in patients being treated for hypertension. Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema): Patients with 
bronchospastic disease should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Labetalol hydrochloride tablets may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other 
antihypertensive agents. LABETALOL: warnings: It is prudent, if labetalol hydrochloride tablets are used, to use the smallest effective dose, so that inhibition of endogenous or exogenous 
beta-agonists is minimized. Pheochromocytoma: Labetalol HCl has been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure and relieving symptoms in patients with pheochromocytoma. However, paradoxical 
hypertensive responses have been reported in a few patients with this tumor; therefore, use caution when administering labetalol HCl to patients with pheochromocytoma. Diabetes Mellitus and 
Hypoglycemia: Beta-adrenergic blockade may prevent the appearance of premonitory signs and symptoms (e.g., tachycardia) of acute hypoglycemia. This is especially important with labile diabetics.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking labetalol HCl in combination with tricyclic antidepressants experienced tremor, as compared to 0.7% 
reported to occur with labetalol HCl alone. The contribution of each of the treatments to this adverse reaction is unknown, but the possibility of a drug interaction cannot be excluded. Drugs 
possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of beta-receptor agonist drugs in patients with bronchospasm; therefore, doses greater than the normal antiasthmatic dose of 
beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs may be required. Cimetidine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of labetalol HCl. Since this could be explained either by enhanced absorption or by an

        Question: Does LABETALOL increase or decrease the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether LABETALOL increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
2. FDAHandler responded with DO-NOT-KNOW, indicating that the FDA label for LABETALOL does not contain information regarding its effect on mortality risk after a myocardial infarction.
        -----
        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for LABETALOL does not contain information regarding its effect on mortality risk after a myocardial infarction. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this data whether 
LABETALOL increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
