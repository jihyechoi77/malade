        -----
        
CONTENT: BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Cyclosporine Avoid concurrent use There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration of BACTRIM and cyclosporine in renal 
transplant recipients. Digoxin Monitor serum digoxin levels Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Indomethacin Avoid concurrent use
Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin. Pyrimethamine Avoid concurrent use Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine 
as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if BACTRIM is prescribed. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) Monitor therapeutic response and adjust dose of TCA 
accordingly The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when coadministered with BACTRIM. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Oral Hypoglycemics Monitor blood glucose more frequently Like other 
sulfonamide-containing drugs, BACTRIM potentiates the effect of oral hypoglycemic that are metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone) or CYP2C9 (e.g., glipizide and 
glyburide) or eliminated renally via OCT2 (e.g., metformin). Additional monitoring of blood glucose may be warranted. Amantadine Avoid concurrent use In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium
has been reported after concomitant intake of BACTRIM and amantadine (an OCT2 substrate). Cases of interactions with other OCT2 substrates, memantine and metformin, have also been reported. BACTRIM: 
drug_interactions: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Avoid concurrent use In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been reported after concomitant intake of 
BACTRIM and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. 5,6 Zidovudine Monitor for hematologic toxicity Zidovudine and BACTRIM are known to induce hematological abnormalities. Hence, there is 
potential for an additive myelotoxicity when coadministered. 7 Dofetilide Concurrent administration is contraindicated Elevated plasma concentrations of dofetilide have been reported following 
concurrent administration of trimethoprim and dofetilide. Increased plasma concentrations of dofetilide may cause serious ventricular arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation, including 
torsade de pointes . BACTRIM: drug_interactions: 8,9 Procainamide Closely monitor for clinical and ECG signs of procainamide toxicity and/or procainamide plasma concentration if available Trimethoprim
increases the plasma concentrations of procainamide and its active N-acetyl metabolite (NAPA) when trimethoprim and procainamide are coadministered. The increased procainamide and NAPA plasma 
concentrations that resulted from the pharmacokinetic interaction with trimethoprim are associated with further prolongation of the QTc interval. BACTRIM: precautions: 8,9 Procainamide Closely monitor
for clinical and ECG signs of procainamide toxicity and/or procainamide plasma concentration if available Trimethoprim increases the plasma concentrations of procainamide and its active N-acetyl 
metabolite (NAPA) when trimethoprim and procainamide are coadministered. The increased procainamide and NAPA plasma concentrations that resulted from the pharmacokinetic interaction with trimethoprim 
are associated with further prolongation of the QTc interval. 10 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions BACTRIM, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as 
determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by 
a radioimmunoassay (RIA). BACTRIM: precautions: The presence of BACTRIM may also interfere with the Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in 
the range of normal values. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Sulfamethoxazole was not carcinogenic when assessed in a 26-week tumorigenic mouse (Tg-rasH2) study at 
doses up to 400 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole; equivalent to 2.4-fold the human systemic exposure (at a daily dose of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole twice a day ). Mutagenesis In vitro reverse mutation 
bacterial tests according to the standard protocol have not been performed with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination. An in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes with 
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim was negative. BACTRIM: precautions: In in vitro and in vivo tests in animal species, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not damage chromosomes. In vivo 
micronucleus assays were positive following oral administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Observations of leukocytes obtained from patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim 
revealed no chromosomal abnormalities. Sulfamethoxazole alone was positive in an in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assay and in in vitro micronucleus assays using cultured human lymphocytes. 
Trimethoprim alone was negative in in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assays and in in vitro chromosomal aberration assays with Chinese Hamster ovary or lung cells with or without S9 activation. In 
in vitro Comet, micronucleus and chromosomal damage assays using cultured human lymphocytes, trimethoprim was positive.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger 
subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate 
deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or 
without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased 
incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be 
monitored. BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage 
adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
section). The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given 
concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM 
treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Bactrim Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Bactrim DS Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.
BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher 
and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics ).

CONTENT: BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Cyclosporine Avoid concurrent use There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration of BACTRIM and cyclosporine in renal 
transplant recipients. Digoxin Monitor serum digoxin levels Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Indomethacin Avoid concurrent use
Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin. Pyrimethamine Avoid concurrent use Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine 
as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if BACTRIM is prescribed. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) Monitor therapeutic response and adjust dose of TCA 
accordingly The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when coadministered with BACTRIM. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Oral Hypoglycemics Monitor blood glucose more frequently Like other 
sulfonamide-containing drugs, BACTRIM potentiates the effect of oral hypoglycemic that are metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone) or CYP2C9 (e.g., glipizide and 
glyburide) or eliminated renally via OCT2 (e.g., metformin). Additional monitoring of blood glucose may be warranted. Amantadine Avoid concurrent use In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium
has been reported after concomitant intake of BACTRIM and amantadine (an OCT2 substrate). Cases of interactions with other OCT2 substrates, memantine and metformin, have also been reported. BACTRIM: 
drug_interactions: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Avoid concurrent use In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been reported after concomitant intake of 
BACTRIM and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. 5,6 Zidovudine Monitor for hematologic toxicity Zidovudine and BACTRIM are known to induce hematological abnormalities. Hence, there is 
potential for an additive myelotoxicity when coadministered. 7 Dofetilide Concurrent administration is contraindicated Elevated plasma concentrations of dofetilide have been reported following 
concurrent administration of trimethoprim and dofetilide. Increased plasma concentrations of dofetilide may cause serious ventricular arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation, including 
torsade de pointes . BACTRIM: drug_interactions: 8,9 Procainamide Closely monitor for clinical and ECG signs of procainamide toxicity and/or procainamide plasma concentration if available Trimethoprim
increases the plasma concentrations of procainamide and its active N-acetyl metabolite (NAPA) when trimethoprim and procainamide are coadministered. The increased procainamide and NAPA plasma 
concentrations that resulted from the pharmacokinetic interaction with trimethoprim are associated with further prolongation of the QTc interval. BACTRIM: precautions: 8,9 Procainamide Closely monitor
for clinical and ECG signs of procainamide toxicity and/or procainamide plasma concentration if available Trimethoprim increases the plasma concentrations of procainamide and its active N-acetyl 
metabolite (NAPA) when trimethoprim and procainamide are coadministered. The increased procainamide and NAPA plasma concentrations that resulted from the pharmacokinetic interaction with trimethoprim 
are associated with further prolongation of the QTc interval. 10 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions BACTRIM, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as 
determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by 
a radioimmunoassay (RIA). BACTRIM: precautions: The presence of BACTRIM may also interfere with the Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in 
the range of normal values. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Sulfamethoxazole was not carcinogenic when assessed in a 26-week tumorigenic mouse (Tg-rasH2) study at 
doses up to 400 mg/kg/day sulfamethoxazole; equivalent to 2.4-fold the human systemic exposure (at a daily dose of 800 mg sulfamethoxazole twice a day ). Mutagenesis In vitro reverse mutation 
bacterial tests according to the standard protocol have not been performed with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in combination. An in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes with 
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim was negative. BACTRIM: precautions: In in vitro and in vivo tests in animal species, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not damage chromosomes. In vivo 
micronucleus assays were positive following oral administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Observations of leukocytes obtained from patients treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim 
revealed no chromosomal abnormalities. Sulfamethoxazole alone was positive in an in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assay and in in vitro micronucleus assays using cultured human lymphocytes. 
Trimethoprim alone was negative in in vitro reverse mutation bacterial assays and in in vitro chromosomal aberration assays with Chinese Hamster ovary or lung cells with or without S9 activation. In 
in vitro Comet, micronucleus and chromosomal damage assays using cultured human lymphocytes, trimethoprim was positive.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger 
subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate 
deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or 
without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased 
incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be 
monitored. BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage 
adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
section). The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given 
concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM 
treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Bactrim Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Bactrim DS Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.
BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher 
and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics ).

The question was whether BACTRIM increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. I attempted to consult FDAHandler to find information on this matter. However, there was no response from 
FDAHandler, indicating that the FDA label data does not specify the answer to this question. Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable answer based on the available data.
