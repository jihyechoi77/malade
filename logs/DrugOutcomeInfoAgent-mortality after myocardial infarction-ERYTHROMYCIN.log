CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN: pregnancy: Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B - There was no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect on reproduction in female rats fed 
erythromycin base (up to 0.25% of diet) prior to and during mating, during gestation and through weaning of two successive litters. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in 
pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed. Erythromycin has been reported to cross 
the placental barrier in humans, but fetal plasma levels are generally low.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General - For topical use only; not for ophthalmic use. Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative 
irritancy effect may occur, especially with the use of peeling, desquamating or abrasive agents. The use of antibiotic agents may be associated with the overgrowth of antibiotic-resistant organisms. 
If this occurs, discontinue use and take appropriate measures. Avoid contact with eyes and all mucous membranes. Information for Patients - Patients using Erythromycin Topical Solution USP, 2% should 
receive the following information and instructions: 1. This medication is to be used as directed by the physician. It is for external use only. Avoid contact with the eyes, nose, mouth, and all mucous
membranes. 2. This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed. 3. Patients should not use any other topical acne medication unless otherwise directed by
their physician. ERYTHROMYCIN: precautions: 4. Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility - No animal studies 
have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or effects on fertility of topical erythromycin. However, long-term (2 years) oral studies in rats with erythromycin 
ethylsuccinate and erythromycin base did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity. There was no apparent effect on male or female fertility in rats fed erythromycin (base) at levels up to 0.25% of diet.

Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed. Erythromycin has been reported to cross the placental 
barrier in humans, but fetal plasma levels are generally low. Nursing Mothers - It is not known whether erythromycin is excreted in human milk after topical application. However, erythromycin is 
excreted in human milk following oral and parenteral erythromycin administration. Therefore, caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use - Safety 
and effectiveness of this product in pediatric patients have not been established.

ethylsuccinate and erythromycin base did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity. There was no apparent effect on male or female fertility in rats fed erythromycin (base) at levels up to 0.25% of diet.
Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B - There was no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect on reproduction in female rats fed erythromycin base (up to 0.25% of diet) 
prior to and during mating, during gestation and through weaning of two successive litters. ERYTHROMYCIN: precautions: There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. 
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed. Erythromycin has been reported to cross the placental 
barrier in humans, but fetal plasma levels are generally low. Nursing Mothers - It is not known whether erythromycin is excreted in human milk after topical application. However, erythromycin is 
excreted in human milk following oral and parenteral erythromycin administration. Therefore, caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use - Safety 
and effectiveness of this product in pediatric patients have not been established.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if ERYTHROMYCIN increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
2. FDAHandler could not provide an answer because the FDA label data does not specify the answer.

The FDA label data does not specify whether erythromycin increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable answer to this question based 
on the available data.
