CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: boxed_warning: WARNING Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs 
are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in 
drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was 
about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death)
or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. THIOTHIXENE: boxed_warning: Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may 
increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is
not clear. Thiothixene is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see WARNINGS ).         
SOURCE:THIOTHIXENE label


CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have
been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced 
leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the 
first few months of therapy and discontinuation of thiothixene should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients 
with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: 
Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue thiothixene and have their WBC followed until recovery. Information for Patients Given the likelihood that 
some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about 
this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided. 
Drug Interactions Hepatic microsomal enzyme inducing agents, such as carbamazepine, were found to significantly increase the clearance of thiothixene. Patients receiving these drugs should be observed
for signs of reduced thiothixene effectiveness 4,5 . THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Due to a possible additive effect with hypotensive agents, patients receiving these drugs should be observed closely for 
signs of excessive hypotension when thiothixene is added to their drug regimen 6 .

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: warnings: WARNINGS Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are 
at an increased risk of death. Thiothixene is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see BOXED WARNING ). Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome 
consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene 1 . Although the prevalence of the syndrome 
appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely
to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the 
likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, 
the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the 
syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the 
syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, 
antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be 
reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are
not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The 
need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, 
some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome. (For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to “ Information
for Patients ” in the PRECAUTIONS section, and to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section.

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Persistent Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy with thiothixene 1 or may 
occur after drug therapy has been discontinued. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, 
puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. Since early detection of tardive dyskinesia is important, patients should be 
monitored on an ongoing basis. It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome. If this or any other presentation of the syndrome is observed, the
clinician should consider possible discontinuation of antipsychotic medication (see WARNINGS section). THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Hepatic Effects Elevations of serum transaminase and alkaline 
phosphatase, usually transient, have been infrequently observed in some patients. No clinically confirmed cases of jaundice attributable to thiothixene have been reported. Hematologic Effects As is 
true with certain other psychotropic drugs, leukopenia and leukocytosis, which are usually transient, can occur occasionally with thiothixene. Other antipsychotic drugs have been associated with 
agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. Allergic Reactions Rash, pruritus, urticaria, photosensitivity and rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with
thiothixene. Undue exposure to sunlight should be avoided. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Although not experienced with thiothixene, exfoliative dermatitis and contact dermatitis (in nursing 
personnel) have been reported with certain phenothiazines. Endocrine/Reproductive Hyperprolactinemia 3 , lactation, menstrual irregularities, moderate breast enlargement and amenorrhea have occurred 
in a small percentage of females receiving thiothixene. If persistent, this may necessitate a reduction in dosage or the discontinuation of therapy. Phenothiazines have been associated with false 
positive pregnancy tests, gynecomastia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and glycosuria. Autonomic Effects Dry mouth, blurred vision, nasal congestion, constipation, increased sweating, increased 
salivation and impotence have occurred infrequently with thiothixene therapy. Phenothiazines have been associated with miosis, mydriasis, and adynamic ileus. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Other 
Adverse Reactions Hyperpyrexia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in appetite and weight, weakness or fatigue, polydipsia, and peripheral edema. Although not reported with thiothixene, 
evidence indicates there is a relationship between phenothiazine therapy and the occurrence of a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Please refer to the 
text regarding NMS in the WARNINGS section. NOTE : Sudden deaths have occasionally been reported in patients who have received certain phenothiazine derivatives. In some cases the cause of death was 
apparently cardiac arrest or asphyxia due to failure of the cough reflex. In others, the cause could not be determined nor could it be established that death was due to phenothiazine administration.

The FDA label for THIOTHIXENE does not specifically mention an increased or decreased risk of bleeding. However, it does note hematologic effects such as leukopenia and leukocytosis, and mentions that
other antipsychotic drugs have been associated with conditions like agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia, which could theoretically affect bleeding risk.
Nonetheless, a direct causal relationship between THIOTHIXENE and bleeding risk is not established in the label.
