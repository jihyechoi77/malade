[31mselectivity of atenolol has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent betab-locking doses of propranolol. ATENOLOL:[0m

[32manemia is not listed as a potential adverse effect or risk associated with atenolol in the provided extracts from the atenolol label. Therefore, based on the information available from the FDA label [0m
