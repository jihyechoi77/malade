[32mThe question was whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. I consulted FDAHandler, and the response indicated that PHENYTOIN has been associated with hematopoietic [0m
[32mcomplications, some of which have been fatal, including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. Aplastic anemia is a [0m
[32mcondition where the bone marrow fails to produce sufficient new cells to replenish blood cells, and pancytopenia can be a manifestation of aplastic anemia. Therefore, the information suggests that [0m
