CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone 
resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. 
Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident 
as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: In osteoporosis 
treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by
approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by 
approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the
treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady state, despite the 
progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum
calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and 
phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate sodium 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of 
treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once 
weekly alendronate sodium 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate 
sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Men Treatment of men with osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day for two 
years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40%. Similar reductions were observed in 
a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability
of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardized breakfast. Oral bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet in
men (0.59%) was similar to that in women when administered after an overnight fast and 2 hours before breakfast. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: BINOSTO 70 mg effervescent tablet and 
alendronate sodium 70 mg tablet are bioequivalent. A study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of BINOSTO was performed in 119 healthy women. Bioavailability was decreased (by 
approximately 50%) when 70 mg alendronate sodium was administered 15 minutes before a standardized breakfast, when compared to dosing 4 hours before eating. In studies of treatment and prevention of 
osteoporosis, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast. Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate sodium was administered with or up to 2 hours after a
standardized breakfast. Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: indications_and_usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BINOSTO is a bisphosphonate indicated for: Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women ( 1.1 ) Treatment to increase 
bone mass in men with osteoporosis ( 1.2 ) Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years 
of use ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of 
osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .] 1. 
ALENDRONATE SODIUM: indications_and_usage: 2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis BINOSTO is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis  . 1.3 Important
Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All
patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 
to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new 
or worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper 
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects 
and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, 
dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and 
rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe 
and required hospitalization. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be 
instructed to discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences 
appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after 
developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot 
comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone 
resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. 
Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident 
as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: In osteoporosis 
treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by
approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by 
approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the
treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady state, despite the 
progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum
calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and 
phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate sodium 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of 
treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once 
weekly alendronate sodium 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate 
sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Men Treatment of men with osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day for two 
years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40%. Similar reductions were observed in 
a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability
of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardized breakfast. Oral bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet in
men (0.59%) was similar to that in women when administered after an overnight fast and 2 hours before breakfast. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: BINOSTO 70 mg effervescent tablet and 
alendronate sodium 70 mg tablet are bioequivalent. A study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of BINOSTO was performed in 119 healthy women. Bioavailability was decreased (by 
approximately 50%) when 70 mg alendronate sodium was administered 15 minutes before a standardized breakfast, when compared to dosing 4 hours before eating. In studies of treatment and prevention of 
osteoporosis, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast. Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate sodium was administered with or up to 2 hours after a
standardized breakfast. Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: indications_and_usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BINOSTO is a bisphosphonate indicated for: Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women ( 1.1 ) Treatment to increase 
bone mass in men with osteoporosis ( 1.2 ) Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years 
of use ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of 
osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .] 1. 
ALENDRONATE SODIUM: indications_and_usage: 2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis BINOSTO is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis  . 1.3 Important
Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All
patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 
to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new 
or worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper 
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects 
and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, 
dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and 
rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe 
and required hospitalization. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be 
instructed to discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences 
appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after 
developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot 
comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone 
resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. 
Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident 
as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: In osteoporosis 
treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by
approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by 
approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the
treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady state, despite the 
progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum
calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and 
phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate sodium 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of 
treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once 
weekly alendronate sodium 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate 
sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Men Treatment of men with osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day for two 
years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40%. Similar reductions were observed in 
a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability
of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardized breakfast. Oral bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet in
men (0.59%) was similar to that in women when administered after an overnight fast and 2 hours before breakfast. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: BINOSTO 70 mg effervescent tablet and 
alendronate sodium 70 mg tablet are bioequivalent. A study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of BINOSTO was performed in 119 healthy women. Bioavailability was decreased (by 
approximately 50%) when 70 mg alendronate sodium was administered 15 minutes before a standardized breakfast, when compared to dosing 4 hours before eating. In studies of treatment and prevention of 
osteoporosis, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast. Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate sodium was administered with or up to 2 hours after a
standardized breakfast. Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: indications_and_usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BINOSTO is a bisphosphonate indicated for: Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women ( 1.1 ) Treatment to increase 
bone mass in men with osteoporosis ( 1.2 ) Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years 
of use ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of 
osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .] 1. 
ALENDRONATE SODIUM: indications_and_usage: 2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis BINOSTO is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis  . 1.3 Important
Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All
patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 
to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new 
or worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper 
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects 
and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, 
dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and 
rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe 
and required hospitalization. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be 
instructed to discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences 
appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after 
developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot 
comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

The FDA label for ALENDRONATE SODIUM does not specify any information regarding its effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, it is not known whether ALENDRONATE SODIUM increases or 
decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.
