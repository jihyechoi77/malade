CONTENT: DOXEPIN HCL: indications_and_usage: Doxepin Hydrochloride Capsules, USP are recommended for the treatment of: Psychoneurotic patients with depression and/or anxiety. Depression and/or anxiety
associated with alcoholism (not to be taken concomitantly with alcohol). Depression and/or anxiety associated with organic disease (the possibility of drug interaction should be considered if the 
patient is receiving other drugs concomitantly). Psychotic depressive disorders with associated anxiety including involutional depression and manic-depressive disorders. The target symptoms of 
psychoneurosis that respond particularly well to doxepin hydrochloride capsules include anxiety, tension, depression, somatic symptoms and concerns, sleep disturbances, guilt, lack of energy, fear, 
apprehension and worry. Clinical experience has shown that doxepin hydrochloride capsules is safe and well tolerated even in the elderly patient. DOXEPIN HCL: indications_and_usage: Owing to lack of 
clinical experience in the pediatric population, doxepin is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age.         
SOURCE:DOXEPIN HCL label


CONTENT: DOXEPIN HCL: clinical_pharmacology: The mechanism of action of doxepin is not definitely known. It is not a central nervous system stimulant nor a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The current 
hypothesis is that the clinical effects are due, at least in part, to influences on the adrenergic activity at the synapses so that deactivation of norepinephrine by reuptake into the nerve terminals 
is prevented. Animal studies suggest that doxepin HCl does not appreciably antagonize the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. In animal studies anticholinergic, antiserotonin and antihistamine 
effects on smooth muscle have been demonstrated. At higher than usual clinical doses, norepinephrine response was potentiated in animals. This effect was not demonstrated in humans. DOXEPIN HCL: 
clinical_pharmacology: At clinical dosages up to 150 mg per day, doxepin can be given to man concomitantly with guanethidine and related compounds without blocking the antihypertensive effect. At 
dosages above 150 mg per day blocking of the antihypertensive effect of these compounds has been reported. Doxepin is virtually devoid of euphoria as a side effect. Characteristic of this type of 
compound, doxepin has not been demonstrated to produce the physical tolerance or psychological dependence associated with addictive compounds.

CONTENT: DOXEPIN HCL: contraindications: Doxepin is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug. Possibility of cross sensitivity with other dibenzoxepines should be 
kept in mind. Doxepin is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma or a tendency to urinary retention. These disorders should be ruled out, particularly in older patients.

ANSWER: Doxepin hydrochloride (HCL) is a dibenzoxepin tricyclic compound used as a psychotherapeutic agent. It is available in various dosages for oral administration, including 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 
75 mg, and 100 mg capsules. The medication is indicated for the treatment of psychoneurotic patients with depression and/or anxiety, depression and/or anxiety associated with alcoholism (not to be 
taken with alcohol), and depression and/or anxiety associated with organic disease. It is also used for psychotic depressive disorders with associated anxiety, including involutional depression and 
manic-depressive disorders. Doxepin HCL is considered safe and well-tolerated, even in elderly patients, but is not recommended for children under 12 years of age due to a lack of clinical experience.
The mechanism of action is believed to be related to preventing the reuptake of norepinephrine into nerve terminals, thus affecting adrenergic activity at synapses. Doxepin HCL is contraindicated in 
individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, those with glaucoma, or a tendency to urinary retention.

does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. This suggests that there may not be any verified effect on the risk of myocardial infarction, or that such an 
effect has not been sufficiently studied or documented to be included in the label.

<DONE> DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for Doxepin HCL does not provide information on whether it increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question 
based on the FDA label data.
