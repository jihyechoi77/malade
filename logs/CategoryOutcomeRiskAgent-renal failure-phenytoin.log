[34mThe question was whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. After consulting with FDAHandler, the information provided from the PHENYTOIN label does not directly address the [0m
[34mrisk of renal failure associated with the use of PHENYTOIN. The label mentions that the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with [0m
[34mhypoalbuminemia, and that monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in these patients. This indicates that there is a consideration for altered phenytoin [0m
[34mpharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment, but it does not specify whether PHENYTOIN use increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, we do not [0m
