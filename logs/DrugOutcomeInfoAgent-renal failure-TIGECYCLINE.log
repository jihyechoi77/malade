CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: clinical_pharmacology: Approximately 22% of the total dose is excreted as unchanged tigecycline in urine. Overall, the primary route of elimination for tigecycline is biliary 
excretion of unchanged tigecycline and its metabolites. Glucuronidation and renal excretion of unchanged tigecycline are secondary routes. Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In a study comparing 
10 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A), 10 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B), and 5 patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) to 23 age and weight 
matched healthy control subjects, the single-dose pharmacokinetic disposition of tigecycline was not altered in patients with mild hepatic impairment. TIGECYCLINE: clinical_pharmacology: However, 
systemic clearance of tigecycline was reduced by 25% and the half-life of tigecycline was prolonged by 23% in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B). Systemic clearance of 
tigecycline was reduced by 55%, and the half-life of tigecycline was prolonged by 43% in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C). Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C)  . TIGECYCLINE: clinical_pharmacology: Renal Impairment A single dose study compared 6 subjects with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), 4 end 
stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving tigecycline 2 hours before hemodialysis, 4 ESRD patients receiving tigecycline 1 hour after hemodialysis, and 6 healthy control subjects. The 
pharmacokinetic profile of tigecycline was not significantly altered in any of the renally impaired patient groups, nor was tigecycline removed by hemodialysis. No dosage adjustment of tigecycline for
injection is necessary in patients with renal impairment or in patients undergoing hemodialysis. TIGECYCLINE: pharmacokinetics: Geriatric Patients No significant differences in pharmacokinetics were 
observed between healthy elderly subjects (n=15, age 65 to 75; n=13, age >75) and younger subjects (n=18) receiving a single 100-mg dose of tigecycline for injection. Therefore, no dosage adjustment 
is necessary based on age  . Pediatric Patients A single-dose safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic study of tigecycline in pediatric patients aged 8 to 16 years who recently recovered from 
infections was conducted. The doses administered were 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/kg. The study showed that for children aged 12 to 16 years (n = 16) a dosage of 50 mg twice daily would likely result in exposures
comparable to those observed in adults with the approved dosing regimen. TIGECYCLINE: pharmacokinetics: Large variability observed in children aged 8 to 11 years of age (n = 8) required additional 
study to determine the appropriate dosage. A subsequent tigecycline dose-finding study was conducted in 8 to 11 year old patients with cIAI, cSSSI, or CABP. The doses of tigecycline studied were 0.75 
mg/kg (n = 17), 1 mg/kg (n = 21), and 1.25 mg/kg (n=20). This study showed that for children aged 8 to 11 years, a 1.2 mg/kg dose would likely result in exposures comparable to those observed in 
adults resulting with the approved dosing regimen . TIGECYCLINE: pharmacokinetics: Excretion The recovery of total radioactivity in feces and urine following administration of 14 C‑tigecycline 
indicates that 59% of the dose is eliminated by biliary/fecal excretion, and 33% is excreted in urine. Approximately 22% of the total dose is excreted as unchanged tigecycline in urine. Overall, the 
primary route of elimination for tigecycline is biliary excretion of unchanged tigecycline and its metabolites. Glucuronidation and renal excretion of unchanged tigecycline are secondary routes. 
TIGECYCLINE: pharmacokinetics: Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In a study comparing 10 patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A), 10 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child

in patients with mild hepatic impairment. However, systemic clearance of tigecycline was reduced by 25% and the half-life of tigecycline was prolonged by 23% in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh B). Systemic clearance of tigecycline was reduced by 55%, and the half-life of tigecycline was prolonged by 43% in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C). 
TIGECYCLINE: pharmacokinetics: Dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C)  . Renal Impairment A single dose study compared 6 subjects with severe renal

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: All-Cause Mortality  Mortality Imbalance and Lower Cure 
Rates in Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia  Anaphylaxis [Warning and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatic Adverse Effects [Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Pancreatitis [Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most 
common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, and increased SGPT. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex at 1-800-706-5575 
or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www. TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: da.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction 
rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, 2514
patients were treated with tigecycline for injection. Tigecycline for injection was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of patients compared to 6% for all comparators. Table 1 shows the 
incidence of adverse reactions through test of cure reported in ≥2% of patients in these trials. Table 1. TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions Through Test of Cure

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: The adjusted risk difference for mortality stratified by trial weight was 0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2). The cause of this mortality difference has not been 
established. Generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, complications of infection or underlying co-morbidities. Tigecycline for injection should be reserved for use in situations when 
alternative treatments are not suitable  . 5.2 Mortality Imbalance and Lower Cure Rates in Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia A trial of patients with hospital acquired, including ventilator-associated, 
pneumonia failed to demonstrate the efficacy of tigecycline for injection. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: In this trial, patients were randomized to receive tigecycline for injection (100 mg 
initially, then 50 mg every 12 hours) or a comparator. In addition, patients were allowed to receive specified adjunctive therapies. The sub-group of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who 
received tigecycline for injection had lower cure rates (47.9% versus 70.1% for the clinically evaluable population). In this trial, greater mortality was seen in patients with ventilator-associated 
pneumonia who received tigecycline for injection (25/131 [19.1%] versus 15/122 [12.3%] in comparator-treated patients)  . Particularly high mortality was seen among tigecycline for injection-treated 
patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia at baseline (9/18 [50.0%] versus 1/13 [7. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 7%] in comparator-treated patients). 5.3 Anaphylactic 
Reactions Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including tigecycline for injection, and may be life-threatening. Tigecycline for injection is structurally 
similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and should be avoided in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. 5.4 Hepatic Adverse Effects Increases in 
total bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time and transaminases have been seen in patients treated with tigecycline. Isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure have been 
reported in patients being treated with tigecycline. Some of these patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Patients who develop abnormal liver 
function tests during tigecycline therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline therapy. Hepatic dysfunction may occur
after the drug has been discontinued. 5.5 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal cases, has occurred in association with tigecycline treatment. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be 
considered in patients taking tigecycline who develop clinical symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Cases have been reported in patients without known risk 
factors for pancreatitis. Patients usually improve after tigecycline discontinuation. Consideration should be given to the cessation of the treatment with tigecycline in cases suspected of having 
developed pancreatitis  . 5. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 6 Monitoring of Blood Coagulation Parameters Hypofibrinogenemia has been reported in patients treated with tigecycline for injection  .
Obtain baseline blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen, and continue to monitor regularly during treatment with tigecycline for injection. 5.7 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The
use of tigecycline for injection during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). 
This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of tetracyclines, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported.

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and 
electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.10 Sepsis/Septic Shock in 
Patients With Intestinal Perforation Monotherapy with tigecycline should be avoided in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) secondary to clinically apparent intestinal 
perforation. In cIAI studies (n=1642), 6 patients treated with tigecycline for injection and 2 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin presented with intestinal perforations and developed 
sepsis/septic shock. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: The 6 patients treated with tigecycline for injection had higher APACHE II scores (median = 13) versus the 2 patients treated with 
imipenem/cilastatin (APACHE II scores = 4 and 6). Due to differences in baseline APACHE II scores between treatment groups and small overall numbers, the relationship of this outcome to treatment 
cannot be established. 5.11 Tetracycline-Class Adverse Effects Tigecycline for injection is structurally similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse effects. Such 
effects may include: photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic action (which has led to increased BUN, azotemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia). 5. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions:
12 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing tigecycline for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and 
increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

ANSWER: The available information from the TIGECYCLINE label does not indicate that tigecycline increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. The pharmacokinetic profile of tigecycline was not 
significantly altered in patients with severe renal impairment or those undergoing hemodialysis, and no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. Additionally, renal failure 
is not listed among the common adverse reactions or specific warnings and precautions associated with tigecycline use.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether TIGECYCLINE increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler responded that the TIGECYCLINE label does not indicate that tigecycline increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
3. The pharmacokinetic profile of tigecycline is not significantly altered in patients with severe renal impairment or those undergoing hemodialysis, and no dosage adjustment is necessary for patients
with renal impairment.
4. Renal failure is not listed among the common adverse reactions or specific warnings and precautions associated with tigecycline use.
        -----
        Final answer: The risk of renal failure is not increased or decreased by TIGECYCLINE according to the available FDA label information.

The final answer to the question "Does TIGECYCLINE increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?" is that according to the available FDA label information, TIGECYCLINE does not increase or decrease 
the risk of renal failure. The pharmacokinetic profile of tigecycline is not significantly altered in patients with severe renal impairment or those undergoing hemodialysis, and no dosage adjustment 
is necessary for patients with renal impairment. Additionally, renal failure is not listed among the common adverse reactions or specific warnings and precautions associated with tigecycline use.
