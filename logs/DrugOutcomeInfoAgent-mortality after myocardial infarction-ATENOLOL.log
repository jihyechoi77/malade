CONTENT: ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Atenolol is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk 
of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of 
pharmacologic classes including atenolol. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, 
antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and 
management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood 
Pressure (JNC). ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized 
controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely
responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular 
mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so 
that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations
with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such 
patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients,
and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. 
Atenolol may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis Atenolol is indicated for the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris. 
ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: Acute Myocardial Infarction Atenolol is indicated in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce
cardiovascular mortality. Treatment can be initiated as soon as the patient's clinical condition allows (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and WARNINGS ). In general, there is no 
basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the ISIS-1 trial (blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg systolic, heart rate less than 50 bpm) or have other reasons to avoid beta blockade. 
As noted above, some subgroups (e.g., elderly patients with systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg) seemed less likely to benefit.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: boxed_warning: In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure Continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to 
cardiac failure. At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should be treated appropriately according to currently recommended guidelines, and the response observed closely. 
If cardiac failure continues despite adequate treatment, atenolol should be withdrawn (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Cessation of Therapy with Atenolol: Patients with coronary artery disease, who 
are being treated with atenolol, should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy. Severe exacerbation of angina and the occurrence of myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have
been reported in angina patients following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta blockers. The last two complications may occur with or without preceding exacerbation of the angina pectoris.
ATENOLOL: boxed_warning: As with other beta blockers, when discontinuation of atenolol is planned, the patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum. If the
angina worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, it is recommended that atenolol be promptly reinstituted, at least temporarily. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be 
unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue atenolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).         
SOURCE:ATENOLOL label


CONTENT: ATENOLOL: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General Patients already on a beta blocker must be evaluated carefully before atenolol is administered. Initial and subsequent atenolol dosages can be 
adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Atenolol may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders. Impaired Renal Function The drug should be 
used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given 
with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with atenolol plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce 
vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Calcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with atenolol (see WARNINGS ). ATENOLOL: precautions: Disopyramide is a Type I 
antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers. 
Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers. Beta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension, which can 
follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta 
blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped. Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, e.g., 
indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers. ATENOLOL: precautions: Information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited. Data from several studies, i.e., 
TIMI-II, ISIS-2, currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and beta blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting. While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of 
anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual 
doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction. Both digitalis glycosides and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of
bradycardia. ATENOLOL: precautions: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two long-term (maximum dosing duration of 18 or 24 months) rat studies and one long-term (maximum dosing 
duration of 18 months) mouse study, each employing dose levels as high as 300 mg/kg/day or 150 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * , did not indicate a carcinogenic potential 
of atenolol. A third (24 month) rat study, employing doses of 500 and 1,500 mg/kg/day (250 and 750 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * ) resulted in increased incidences of 
benign adrenal medullary tumors in males and females, mammary fibroadenomas in females, and anterior pituitary adenomas and thyroid parafollicular cell carcinomas in males. ATENOLOL: precautions: No 
evidence of a mutagenic potential of atenolol was uncovered in the dominant lethal test (mouse), in vivo cytogenetics test (Chinese hamster) or Ames test (S. typhimurium). Fertility of male or female 
rats (evaluated at dose levels as high as 200 mg/kg/day or 100 times the maximum recommended human dose * ) was unaffected by atenolol administration. Animal Toxicology Chronic studies employing oral 
atenolol performed in animals have revealed the occurrence of vacuolation of epithelial cells of Brunner's glands in the duodenum of both male and female dogs at all tested dose levels of atenolol 
(starting at 15 mg/kg/day or 7. ATENOLOL: precautions: 5 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * ) and increased incidence of atrial degeneration of hearts of male rats at 300 but 
not 150 mg atenolol/kg/day (150 and 75 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * , respectively). ________________________________________________________________________ * Based on 
the maximum dose of 100 mg/day in a 50 kg patient. Usage in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D : See WARNINGS - Pregnancy and Fetal Injury. Nursing Mothers Atenolol is excreted in human breast milk at a 
ratio of 1.5 to 6.8 when compared to the concentration in plasma. Caution should be exercised when atenolol is administered to a nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in 
breast fed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely to develop adverse effects. ATENOLOL: precautions: Neonates born to mothers who are receiving 
atenolol at parturition or breast-feeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia and bradycardia. Caution should be exercised when atenolol is administered during pregnancy or to a woman who is 
breast-feeding (see WARNING, Pregnancy and Fetal Injury ). Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Hypertension and Angina Pectoris Due to
Coronary Atherosclerosis Clinical studies of atenolol did not include sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported
clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the 
low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. ATENOLOL: precautions: Acute 
Myocardial Infarction Of the 8,037 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomized to atenolol in the ISIS-1 trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ), 33% (2,644) were 65 years of age and 
older. It was not possible to identify significant differences in efficacy and safety between older and younger patients; however, elderly patients with systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg seemed less 
likely to benefit (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency 
of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment 
of renal function.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension: The initial dose of atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day either alone or added to diuretic therapy. The 
full effect of this dose will usually be seen within one to two weeks. If an optimal response is not achieved, the dosage should be increased to atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Increasing 
the dosage beyond 100 mg a day is unlikely to produce any further benefit. Atenolol may be used alone or concomitantly with other antihypertensive agents including thiazide-type diuretics, 
hydralazine, prazosin, and alpha-methyldopa. Angina Pectoris The initial dose of atenolol is 50 mg given as one tablet a day. ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: If an optimal response is not 
achieved within one week, the dosage should be increased to atenolol 100 mg given as one tablet a day. Some patients may require a dosage of 200 mg once a day for optimal effect. Twenty-four hour 
control with once daily dosing is achieved by giving doses larger than necessary to achieve an immediate maximum effect. The maximum early effect on exercise tolerance occurs with doses of 50 to 100 
mg, but at these doses the effect at 24 hours is attenuated, averaging about 50% to 75% of that observed with once a day oral doses of 200 mg. Acute Myocardial Infarction In patients with definite or 
suspected acute myocardial infarction, treatment with atenolol injection should be initiated as soon as possible after the patient's arrival in the hospital and after eligibility is established. Such 
treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient's hemodynamic condition has stabilized. ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: Treatment should begin with 
the intravenous administration of 5 mg atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes later. Atenolol injection should be administered under carefully controlled 
conditions including monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram. Dilutions of atenolol injection in Dextrose Injection USP, Sodium Chloride Injection USP, or Sodium Chloride and 
Dextrose Injection may be used. These admixtures are stable for 48 hours if they are not used immediately. In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), atenolol tablets 50 mg should be 
initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a 
further 6 to 9 days or until discharge from the hospital. ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: If bradycardia or hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, atenolol should be
discontinued (see full prescribing information prior to initiating therapy with atenolol tablets). Data from other beta blocker trials suggest that if there is any question concerning the use of IV 
beta blocker or clinical estimate that there is a contraindication, the IV beta blocker may be eliminated and patients fulfilling the safety criteria may be given atenolol tablets 50 mg twice daily or
100 mg once a day for at least seven days (if the IV dosing is excluded). Although the demonstration of efficacy of atenolol is based entirely on data from the first seven postinfarction days, data 
from other beta blocker trials suggest that treatment with beta blockers that are effective in the postinfarction setting may be continued for one to three years if there are no contraindications. 
ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: Atenolol is an additional treatment to standard coronary care unit therapy. Elderly Patients or Patients with Renal Impairment Atenolol is excreted by the kidneys;
consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the 
dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial 
infarction should always include assessment of renal function. Atenolol excretion would be expected to decrease with advancing age. No significant accumulation of atenolol occurs until creatinine 
clearance falls below 35 mL/min/1.73m 2 . Accumulation of atenolol and prolongation of its half-life were studied in subjects with creatinine clearance between 5 and 105 mL/min. ATENOLOL: 
dosage_and_administration: Peak plasma levels were significantly increased in subjects with creatinine clearances below 30 mL/min. The following maximum oral dosages are recommended for elderly, 
renally-impaired patients and for patients with renal impairment due to other causes: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73m 2 ) Atenolol Elimination Half-Life (h) Maximum Dosage 15-35 16-27 50 mg daily 
<15 >27 25 mg daily Some renally impaired or elderly patients being treated for hypertension may require a lower starting dose of atenolol: 25 mg given as one tablet a day. If this 25 mg dose is used,
assessment of efficacy must be made carefully. This should include measurement of blood pressure just prior to the next dose ("trough" blood pressure) to ensure that the treatment effect is present 
for a full 24 hours. ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: Although a similar dosage reduction may be considered for elderly and/or renally impaired patients being treated for indications other than 
hypertension, data are not available for these patient populations. Patients on hemodialysis should be given 25 mg or 50 mg after each dialysis; this should be done under hospital supervision as 
marked falls in blood pressure can occur. Cessation of Therapy in Patients with Angina Pectoris If withdrawal of atenolol therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually and patients should be 
carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse effects have been mild and transient. The frequency estimates in the following table were derived from controlled studies in 
hypertensive patients in which adverse reactions were either volunteered by the patient (US studies) or elicited, e.g., by checklist (foreign studies). The reported frequency of elicited adverse 
effects was higher for both atenolol and placebo-treated patients than when these reactions were volunteered. Where frequency of adverse effects of atenolol and placebo is similar, causal relationship
to atenolol is uncertain. Volunteered ( US Studies ) Total-Volunteered and Elicited ( Foreign + US Studies ) Atenolol (n = 164) % Placebo (n = 206) % Atenolol (n = 399) % Placebo (n = 407) %

ATENOLOL decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which states that Atenolol is indicated for the management of 
hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality. The International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-1), which included over 
16,000 patients, used atenolol to treat patients with acute myocardial infarction, suggesting a benefit in reducing cardiovascular mortality.
