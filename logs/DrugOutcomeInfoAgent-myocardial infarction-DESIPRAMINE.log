CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with desipramine hydrochloride or within 14 days of stopping treatment with 
desipramine hydrochloride is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of desipramine hydrochloride within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric 
disorders is also contraindicated ( see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Starting desipramine hydrochloride in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous 
methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Desipramine hydrochloride is contraindicated in the acute 
recovery period following myocardial infarction. It should not be used in those who have shown prior hypersensitivity to the drug. DESIPRAMINE: contraindications: Cross-sensitivity between this and 
other dibenzazepines is a possibility.         
SOURCE:DESIPRAMINE label


CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: boxed_warning: Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, 
adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of desipramine hydrochloride tablets or any other 
antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants 
compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are 
themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical 
worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. DESIPRAMINE: boxed_warning: Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. 
Desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients ( See WARNINGS: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk , PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients , and PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use .  
SOURCE:DESIPRAMINE label


CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not 
established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar 
disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be
adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and 
depression. It should be noted that desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Serotonin Syndrome: The development of a potentially 
life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and SSRIs, including desipramine hydrochloride, alone but particularly with concomitant 
use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of 
serotonin (in particular, MAOIs both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental 
status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular 
changes (e.g. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be 
monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. The concomitant use of desipramine hydrochloride with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Desipramine hydrochloride 
should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of 
administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local 
tissue injection) or at lower doses. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a 
patient taking desipramine hydrochloride. Desipramine hydrochloride should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If 
concomitant use of desipramine hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is 
clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with desipramine 
hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: 
Angle-Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including desipramine hydrochloride may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with 
anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. General Extreme caution should be used when this drug is given in the following situations: In patients with cardiovascular disease, 
because of the possibility of conduction defects, arrhythmias, tachycardias, strokes, and acute myocardial infarction. In patients who have a family history of sudden death, cardiac dysrhythmias, or 
cardiac conduction disturbances. In patients with a history of urinary retention or glaucoma, because of the anticholinergic properties of the drug. In patients with thyroid disease or those taking 
thyroid medication, because of the possibility of cardiovascular toxicity, including arrhythmias. In patients with a history of seizure disorder, because this drug has been shown to lower the seizure 
threshold. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Seizures precede cardiac dysrhythmias and death in some patients. This drug is capable of blocking the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine and similarly acting 
compounds. The patient should be cautioned that this drug may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating
machinery. In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it should be borne in mind that the potentiation may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage. Pregnancy There is a 
pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in woman exposed to antidepressants, including desipramine hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to 
register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at http://womensmentalhealth. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: /clinical-and-research- 
programs/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants Safe use of desipramine hydrochloride during pregnancy and lactation has not been established; therefore, if it is to be given to pregnant patients, nursing 
mothers, or women of childbearing potential, the possible benefits must be weighed against the possible hazards to mother and child. Animal reproductive studies have been inconclusive. Geriatric Use 
Clinical studies of desipramine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported 
clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Lower doses are recommended for elderly patients. ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) The ratio
of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the elderly, most likely due to decreased renal elimination with aging. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: This drug is known to be substantially 
excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function,
care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desipramine hydrochloride use in the elderly has been associated with a proneness to falling as well as 
confusional states (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Included in the following listing are a few adverse reactions that have not been reported with this specific drug. However, the pharmacologic
similarities among the tricyclic antidepressant drugs require that each of the reactions be considered when desipramine hydrochloride is given. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, hypertension, palpitations,
heart block, myocardial infarction, stroke, arrhythmias, premature ventricular contractions, tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, sudden death There has been a report of an 
"acute collapse" and "sudden death" in an 8-year-old (18 kg) male, treated for 2 years for hyperactivity. DESIPRAMINE: adverse_reactions: There have been additional reports of sudden death in children
( See PRECAUTIONS- Pediatric Use ) Psychiatric: Confusional states (especially in the elderly) with hallucinations, disorientation, delusions; anxiety, restlessness, agitation; insomnia and

DESIPRAMINE is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, especially in patients in the acute recovery period following a myocardial infarction or those with cardiovascular disease. 
This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which indicates that DESIPRAMINE is contraindicated in the acute recovery period following myocardial infarction and that extreme caution is 
advised when it is given to patients with cardiovascular disease due to the possibility of conduction defects, arrhythmias, tachycardias, strokes, and acute myocardial infarction.
