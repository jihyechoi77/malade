[34mnot specifically mention an increased risk of acute liver injury as a common adverse reaction. However, the label advises caution when using lorazepam in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency [0m
[34mand/or encephalopathy, and recommends dosage adjustments for these patients. Additionally, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are suggested for patients on long-term therapy, which implies[0m
[34msome concern about the potential impact of lorazepam on liver function. Therefore, while there is no explicit statement about an increased risk, there is an implication that lorazepam could [0m
[34mpotentially affect liver health, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver conditions.[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. Drug DIAZEPAM: The question was whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of acute liver injury. Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, the FDA label does not explicitly state that[0m
[34mdiazepam increases the risk of acute liver injury. However, it does indicate that diazepam's pharmacokinetics are altered in patients with hepatic insufficiency, which includes conditions such as [0m
[34mhepatic fibrosis and hepatitis. This suggests that there is a potential for increased risk or exacerbation of liver injury in patients with pre-existing liver conditions, and therefore caution is [0m
[34madvised when prescribing diazepam to such patients. The degree of risk for acute liver injury specifically due to diazepam in patients without pre-existing liver conditions is not clearly stated in [0m
[34mthe FDA label data.[0m

[34mpatients with pre-existing liver disease. It is contraindicated in patients with significant liver disease, and caution is advised when administering it to patients with liver disease due to potential[0m
[34mimpairment of drug elimination. This conclusion is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which indicates that CLONAZEPAM is contraindicated in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence[0m
