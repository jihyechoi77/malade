[31mnot be used since haloperidol may block its vasopressor activity and paradoxical further lowering of the blood pressure may occur. Instead, metaraminol, phenylephrine or norepinephrine should be used.[0m
[31m-receiving anticonvulsant medications, with a history of seizures, or with EEG abnormalities, because haloperidol may lower the convulsive threshold. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: If indicated, adequate [0m
[31manticonvulsant therapy should be concomitantly maintained. -with known allergies, or with a history of allergic reactions to drugs. -receiving anticoagulants, since an isolated instance of [0m
[31minterference occurred with the effects of one anticoagulant [0m[1;31m([0m[31mphenindione[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m. If concomitant antiparkinson medication is required, it may have to be continued after haloperidol is discontinued because of[0m
[31mthe difference in excretion rates. If both are discontinued simultaneously, extrapyramidal symptoms may occur. The physician should keep in mind the possible increase in intraocular pressure when [0m
[31manticholinergic drugs, including antiparkinson agents, are administered concomitantly with haloperidol. As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that haloperidol may be capable of [0m
[31mpotentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: In a study of [0m[1;31m12[0m[31m schizophrenic patients coadministered haloperidol and rifampin, plasma haloperidol [0m
[31mlevels were decreased by a mean of [0m[1;31m70[0m[31m% and mean scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were increased from baseline. In five other schizophrenic patients treated with haloperidol and rifampin, [0m
[31mdiscontinuation of rifampin produced a mean [0m[1;31m3.3[0m[31m-fold increase in haloperidol concentrations. Thus, careful monitoring of clinical status is warranted when rifampin is administered or discontinued in [0m
[31mhaloperidol-treated patients. When haloperidol is used to control mania in cyclic disorders, there may be a rapid mood swing to depression. Severe neurotoxicity [0m[1;31m([0m[31mrigidity, inability to walk or talk[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m [0m

[31mSalmonella microsomal activation assay. Negative or inconsistent positive findings have been obtained in in vitro and in vivo studies of effects of haloperidol on chromosome structure and number. The [0m
[31mavailable cytogenetic evidence is considered too inconsistent to be conclusive at this time. Carcinogenicity studies using oral haloperidol were conducted in Wistar rats [0m[1;31m([0m[31mdosed at up to [0m[1;31m5[0m[31m mg/kg daily [0m

[31mdeveloping tumors. However, although a relatively greater number of rats survived to the end of the study in high dose male and female groups, these animals did not have a greater incidence of tumors [0m
[31mthan control animals. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: Therefore, although not optimal, this study does suggest the absence of a haloperidol related increase in the incidence of neoplasia in rats at doses up[0m
[31mto [0m[1;31m20[0m[31m times the usual daily human dose for chronic or resistant patients. In female mice at [0m[1;31m5[0m[31m and [0m[1;31m20[0m[31m times the highest initial daily dose for chronic or resistant patients, there was a statistically [0m
[31msignificant increase in mammary gland neoplasia and total tumor incidence; at [0m[1;31m20[0m[31m times the same daily dose there was a statistically significant increase in pituitary gland neoplasia. In male mice, no[0m
[31mstatistically significant differences in incidences of total tumors or specific tumor types were noted. Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic [0m
[31madministration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these[0m
[31mdrugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been [0m
[31mreported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of [0m
[31mantipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; [0m
[31mthe available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. There are no well controlled studies with haloperidol in pregnant women. There are reports, however, of cases of limb [0m
[31mmalformations observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy. Causal relationships were not [0m
[31mestablished in these cases. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, this drug should be used during pregnancy or in women [0m
[31mlikely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus. Infants should not be nursed during drug treatment. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric [0m
[31mpatients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of haloperidol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged [0m[1;31m65[0m[31m and over to determine whether they respond differently from [0m
[31myounger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not consistently identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia [0m

[31mParkinson-like symptoms, akathisia, or dystonia [0m[1;31m([0m[31mincluding opisthotonos and oculogyric crisis[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m. While all can occur at relatively low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity at [0m
[31mhigher doses. The symptoms may be controlled with dose reductions or administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate, USP or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride, USP. It should be noted [0m
[31mthat persistent EPS have been reported; the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases. Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in [0m
[31msusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, [0m
[31mswallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at[0m
[31mhigher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs Generally, patients [0m
[31mreceiving short-term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after [0m
[31mabrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under “Tardive Dyskinesia” except for duration. HALOPERIDOL: [0m
[31madverse_reactions: It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs but until further evidence becomes [0m
[31mavailable, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of haloperidol. Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents, haloperidol has been associated with persistent dyskinesias. Tardive [0m
[31mdyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may occur after drug therapy has been [0m
[31mdiscontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on high dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear irreversible. The syndrome is [0m
[31mcharacterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue, face, mouth or jaw [0m[1;31m([0m[31me.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m. Sometimes these may be [0m
[31maccompanied by involuntary movements of extremities and the trunk. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; antiparkinson agents usually do not [0m
[31malleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage[0m
[31mof the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked. It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and[0m
[31mif the medication is stopped at that time, the full syndrome may not develop. Tardive Dystonia Tardive dystonia, not associated with the above syndrome, has also been reported. Tardive dystonia is [0m
