CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood 
pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a
wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as 
appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure 
goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Programâ€™s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, 
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of 
action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic 
property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in 
myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg 
is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: Relative risk reduction from blood 
pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, 
patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood 
pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). 
These considerations may guide selection of therapy. These fixed-dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: In using 
lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients 
with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk. (See WARNINGS .) In considering use of lisinopril and
hydrochlorothiazide tablets, it should be noted that Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-Black. (See WARNINGS, Head and 
Neck Angioedema .

LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Angioedema: Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving PRINZIDE, with an incidence higher in Black than in non-Black patients. Angioedema associated with 
laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx occurs, treatment with PRINZIDE should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted 
immediately. In rare cases, intestinal angioedema has been reported with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors including lisinopril. (See WARNINGS ). Hypotension: In clinical trials, adverse 
effects relating to hypotension occurred as follows: hypotension (1.4 percent), orthostatic hypotension (0.5 percent), other orthostatic effects (3.2 percent). In addition syncope occurred in 0.8 
percent of patients (See WARNINGS ). LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Cough: See PRECAUTIONS - Cough . Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes: (See PRECAUTIONS ). Creatinine, Blood Urea 
Nitrogen: Minor reversible increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in patients with essential hypertension treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. More 
marked increases have also been reported and were more likely to occur in patients with renal artery stenosis (See PRECAUTIONS ). Serum Uric Acid, Glucose, Magnesium, Cholesterol, Triglycerides and 
Calcium: (See PRECAUTIONS ). Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.5 g% and 1.5 vol%, respectively) occurred frequently in 
hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets but were rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexisted. LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: In

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: mechanism_of_action: Mechanism of Action Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the 
conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma 
angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Removal of angiotensin II 
negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase 
in serum potassium was less than 0.1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15 percent of patients had increases greater than 0. LISINOPRIL: mechanism_of_action: 5 mEq/L and approximately six percent had a 
decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS .) ACE is identical to 
kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated. 
While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients 
with low-renin hypertension. LISINOPRIL: mechanism_of_action: Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) 
had a smaller average response to lisinopril monotherapy than non-Black patients.
