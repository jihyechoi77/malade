                Passages:
                1. Drug PHENYTOIN SODIUM: The final answer to the question "Does PHENYTOIN SODIUM increase or decrease the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction?" is that PHENYTOIN SODIUM can 
increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction due to its association with severe cardiovascular events, including cardiac arrhythmias and death. This conclusion is based on the 
information provided by FDAHandler, which indicates that Phenytoin Sodium has been associated with these severe cardiovascular events, particularly in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and 
those with severe myocardial insufficiency, and can occur even at recommended doses and infusion rates.
2. Drug PHENYTOIN: DO-NOT-KNOW

I requested information from FDAHandler regarding the effect of PHENYTOIN on mortality risk after myocardial infarction but did not receive the necessary data to provide an informed answer. Without 
specific FDA label data, I cannot determine whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases mortality risk in this context. Therefore, the final answer to the question is DO-NOT-KNOW.
3. Drug EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: It seems there was an issue with the communication with FDAHandler, and I was not able to retrieve the necessary information to answer your question. Therefore, I 
must state that I do not know whether extended phenytoin sodium increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction based on FDA label data.

 DO-NOT-KNOW
                ---------
                Does the phenytoin category of drugs increase the risk of
                mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the phenytoin category of drugs increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction due to its association with severe cardiovascular events.
2. Passage 2 and 3 do not provide conclusive information about PHENYTOIN and EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM, respectively, stating a 'DO-NOT-KNOW' status due to lack of data.
3. Since only one drug in the phenytoin category (PHENYTOIN SODIUM) has been associated with an increased risk of mortality and the effects of the other drugs in the category are unknown, it is not 
possible to generalize the effect for the entire category.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the phenytoin category of drugs on the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction as the information is only available for PHENYTOIN SODIUM, which 
increases the risk, but there is no data for PHENYTOIN and EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM.
