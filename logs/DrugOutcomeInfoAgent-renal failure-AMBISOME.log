urticaria, bronchospasm, cyanosis/hypoventilation, pulmonary edema, agranulocytosis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and rhabdomyolysis. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Clinical Laboratory Values The effect of Am 
B isome on renal and hepatic function and on serum electrolytes was assessed from laboratory values measured repeatedly in Study 94-0-002. The frequency and magnitude of hepatic test abnormalities 
were similar in the Am B isome and amphotericin B groups. Nephrotoxicity was defined as creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in pediatric patients, and creatinine values 
increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in adult patients, provided the peak creatinine concentration was > 1.2 mg/dL. Hypokalemia was defined as potassium levels â‰¤ 2.5 mmol/L any time during
treatment. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Incidence of nephrotoxicity, mean peak serum creatinine concentration, mean change from baseline in serum creatinine, and incidence of hypokalemia in the 
double-blind, randomized study were lower in the Am B isome group as summarized in the following table: Study 94-0-002 Laboratory Evidence of Nephrotoxicity AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.6

patients enrolled in this study is illustrated in the following figure: In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, the incidence of nephrotoxicity as measured by increases of serum creatinine from baseline 
was significantly lower for patients administered Am B isome (individual dose groups and combined) compared with amphotericin B lipid complex. Incidence of Nephrotoxicity Empirical Therapy Study

ANSWER: AMBISOME has been associated with renal adverse effects, including abnormal renal function, acute kidney failure, acute renal failure, and toxic nephropathy. However, in comparative studies, 
the incidence of nephrotoxicity was lower in patients treated with AMBISOME compared to those treated with amphotericin B or amphotericin B lipid complex. For example, in Study 94-0-002, the incidence
of nephrotoxicity was 18.7% for AMBISOME compared to 33.7% for amphotericin B. Similarly, in empirical therapy study 97-0-034, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly lower for patients 
administered AMBISOME compared with amphotericin B lipid complex. These findings suggest that while AMBISOME can increase the risk of renal failure, it may do so to a lesser extent than other 
formulations of amphotericin B.

        Question: Does AMBISOME increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler responded that AMBISOME has been associated with renal adverse effects, including abnormal renal function, acute kidney failure, acute renal failure, and toxic nephropathy.
3. FDAHandler also noted that in comparative studies, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was lower in patients treated with AMBISOME compared to those treated with amphotericin B or amphotericin B lipid 
complex, indicating that while AMBISOME can increase the risk of renal failure, it may do so to a lesser extent than other formulations of amphotericin B.

        Final answer: AMBISOME has been associated with an increased risk of renal failure, including acute kidney failure and toxic nephropathy. However, it appears to have a lower incidence of 
nephrotoxicity compared to other formulations of amphotericin B.

other formulations of amphotericin B.
