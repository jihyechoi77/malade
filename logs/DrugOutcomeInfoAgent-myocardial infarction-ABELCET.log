CONTENT: ABELCET: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate patients), 
of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 patients were 
treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with ABELCET ® , 9% 
discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient chills and/or fever 
during infusion of the drug. ABELCET: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14 Increased Serum Creatinine 11

CONTENT: ABELCET: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use: Forty-nine elderly patients, age 65 years or over, have been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, prospective,
single-arm study. No serious unexpected adverse events have been reported.

CONTENT: ABELCET: drug_interactions: Intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended in patients requiring any combination of nephrotoxic medications. Skeletal muscle relaxants: Amphotericin 
B-induced hypokalemia may enhance the curariform effect of skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g., tubocurarine) due to hypokalemia. When administered concomitantly with ABELCET ® , serum potassium levels 
should be closely monitored. Zidovudine: Increased myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were observed in dogs when either ABELCET ® (at doses 0.16 or 0.5 times the recommended human dose) or amphotericin 
B desoxycholate (at 0.5 times the recommended human dose) were administered concomitantly with zidovudine for 30 days. If zidovudine is used concomitantly with ABELCET ® , renal and hematologic 
function should be closely monitored. ABELCET: precautions: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic 
potential of ABELCET ® . The following in vitro (with and without metabolic activation) and in vivo studies to assess ABELCET ® for mutagenic potential were conducted: bacterial reverse mutation 
assay, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, chromosomal aberration assay in CHO cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. ABELCET ® was found to be without mutagenic effects in all assay systems.
Studies demonstrated that ABELCET ® had no impact on fertility in male and female rats at doses up to 0.32 times the recommended human dose (based on body surface area considerations). Pregnancy: 
There are no reports of pregnant women having been treated with ABELCET ® . Teratogenic Effects. ABELCET: precautions: Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits at doses of ABELCET ® up to 0.64 times 
the human dose revealed no harm to the fetus. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, and adequate and well-controlled studies have not been conducted in 
pregnant women, ABELCET ® should be used during pregnancy only after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether ABELCET ® is excreted in 
human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants from ABELCET ® , a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. ABELCET: precautions: Pediatric Use: One hundred eleven children (2 were enrolled twice 
and counted as separate patients), age 16 years and under, of whom 11 were less than 1 year, have been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, prospective, 
single-arm study. In one single-center study, 5 children with hepatosplenic candidiasis were effectively treated with 2.5 mg/kg/day of ABELCET ® . No serious unexpected adverse events have been 
reported. Geriatric Use: Forty-nine elderly patients, age 65 years or over, have been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, prospective, single-arm study. No 
serious unexpected adverse events have been reported.

        Question: Does ABELCET increase or decrease the risk of myocardial infarction?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.
2. FDAHandler responded that myocardial infarction has been reported as an adverse event in patients using ABELCET in open-label, uncontrolled clinical studies, but the causal association between 
these adverse events and ABELCET is uncertain.
        -----
        Final answer: ABELCET has been associated with reports of myocardial infarction as an adverse event; however, the causal relationship between ABELCET and myocardial infarction is not clearly 
established. Therefore, it is not definitively known if ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.

ABELCET has been associated with reports of myocardial infarction as an adverse event; however, the causal relationship between ABELCET and myocardial infarction is not clearly established. Therefore,
it is not definitively known if ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.
