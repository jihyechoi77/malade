specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of hip fracture as a side effect or outcome of using the medication. Minocycline is a tetracycline-class drug indicated for the treatment of 
inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older. The label mentions various potential side effects, but hip fracture risk is not listed among
them.

Therefore, based on the FDA label data, I do not have information regarding the effect of minocycline on the risk of hip fracture. My final answer is DO-NOT-KNOW because the FDA label data does not 
specify the answer to this question.

        Do one of the following:

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.
            DO NOT REPEAT your original message; ONLY specify the

        2. If you are ready to have the critic check your answer,
            do so with the `final_answer` tool/function, as I have requested.
        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing

The FDA label for minocycline does not provide information on whether minocycline increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. The label indicates that minocycline is used for the treatment of 
inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older, and lists various potential side effects, but hip fracture risk is not mentioned. Therefore,
based on the FDA label data, the effect of minocycline on the risk of hip fracture cannot be determined.
