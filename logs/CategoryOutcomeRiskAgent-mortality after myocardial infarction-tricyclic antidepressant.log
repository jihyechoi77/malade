                Passages:
                1. Drug DOXEPIN HCL: The FDAHandler has indicated that the FDA label for DOXEPIN HCL does not contain information regarding the effect of DOXEPIN HCL on the risk of mortality after 
myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, I cannot determine whether DOXEPIN HCL increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.

 DO-NOT-KNOW

The justification for this answer is that the FDA label for DOXEPIN HCL, as provided by the FDAHandler, does not mention any information about the drug's impact on mortality post-myocardial 
infarction. Without this specific information in the FDA label, it is not possible to ascertain the effect of DOXEPIN HCL on mortality risk after a myocardial infarction.
2. Drug DESIPRAMINE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The information provided by FDAHandler from the DESIPRAMINE label did not specifically mention the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, it is not 
possible to determine whether DESIPRAMINE increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
3. Drug AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL may increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction if used inappropriately or in overdose situations. This is based on the information provided
by FDAHandler, which indicates that AMITRIPTYLINE HCL is not recommended for use during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction due to the potential for increased QT interval and 
increased risk for arrhythmia. Overdosage of tricyclic antidepressants like Amitriptyline HCL can lead to severe cardiovascular complications, including cardiac dysrhythmias and severe hypotension, 
which can be fatal.

                Does the tricyclic antidepressant category of drugs increase the risk of
                mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that there is no information available in the FDA label for DOXEPIN HCL regarding its effect on mortality after myocardial infarction.
2. Passage 2 also indicates a lack of information in the FDA label for DESIPRAMINE regarding its effect on mortality after myocardial infarction.
3. Passage 3 suggests that AMITRIPTYLINE HCL may increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, especially if used inappropriately or in overdose situations, due to the potential for 
increased QT interval and risk for arrhythmia.
4. Based on the available information, there is evidence that at least one drug in the tricyclic antidepressant category (AMITRIPTYLINE HCL) can increase the risk of mortality post-myocardial 
infarction, while for the other drugs (DOXEPIN HCL and DESIPRAMINE), the effect is unknown due to lack of specific information.
        -----
        Final answer: The tricyclic antidepressant category of drugs may increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
