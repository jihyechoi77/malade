CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: boxed_warning: Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, 
adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of desipramine hydrochloride tablets or any other 
antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants 
compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are 
themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical 
worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. DESIPRAMINE: boxed_warning: Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. 
Desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients ( See WARNINGS: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk , PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients , and PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use .

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not 
established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar 
disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be
adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and 
depression. It should be noted that desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Serotonin Syndrome: The development of a potentially 
life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and SSRIs, including desipramine hydrochloride, alone but particularly with concomitant 
use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of 
serotonin (in particular, MAOIs both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental 
status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular 
changes (e.g. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be 
monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. The concomitant use of desipramine hydrochloride with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Desipramine hydrochloride 
should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of 
administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local 
tissue injection) or at lower doses. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a 
patient taking desipramine hydrochloride. Desipramine hydrochloride should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If 
concomitant use of desipramine hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is 
clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with desipramine 
hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: 
Angle-Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including desipramine hydrochloride may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with 
anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. General Extreme caution should be used when this drug is given in the following situations: In patients with cardiovascular disease, 
because of the possibility of conduction defects, arrhythmias, tachycardias, strokes, and acute myocardial infarction. In patients who have a family history of sudden death, cardiac dysrhythmias, or 
cardiac conduction disturbances. In patients with a history of urinary retention or glaucoma, because of the anticholinergic properties of the drug. In patients with thyroid disease or those taking 
thyroid medication, because of the possibility of cardiovascular toxicity, including arrhythmias. In patients with a history of seizure disorder, because this drug has been shown to lower the seizure 
threshold. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Seizures precede cardiac dysrhythmias and death in some patients. This drug is capable of blocking the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine and similarly acting 
compounds. The patient should be cautioned that this drug may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating
machinery. In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it should be borne in mind that the potentiation may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage. Pregnancy There is a 
pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in woman exposed to antidepressants, including desipramine hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to 
register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at http://womensmentalhealth. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: /clinical-and-research- 
programs/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants Safe use of desipramine hydrochloride during pregnancy and lactation has not been established; therefore, if it is to be given to pregnant patients, nursing 
mothers, or women of childbearing potential, the possible benefits must be weighed against the possible hazards to mother and child. Animal reproductive studies have been inconclusive. Geriatric Use 
Clinical studies of desipramine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported 
clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Lower doses are recommended for elderly patients. ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) The ratio
of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the elderly, most likely due to decreased renal elimination with aging. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: This drug is known to be substantially 
excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function,
care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desipramine hydrochloride use in the elderly has been associated with a proneness to falling as well as 
confusional states (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and 
risks associated with treatment with desipramine hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious 
Mental illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for desipramine hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to 
read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any 
questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if 
these occur while taking desipramine hydrochloride. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to 
the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in 
behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be 
advised to observe for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, 
especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and 
behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Patients should be advised that taking desipramine hydrochloride can cause mild
pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle closure glaucoma, when 
diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open- angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible
to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established ( see BOX 
WARNING and WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Therefore, desipramine hydrochloride is not recommended for use in children. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Anyone considering the use of 
desipramine hydrochloride in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need (see also ADVERSE REACTIONS- Cardiovascular ). General It is important that this drug be 
dispensed in the least possible quantities to depressed outpatients, since suicide has been accomplished with this class of drug ( see WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Ordinary prudence
requires that children not have access to this drug or to potent drugs of any kind; if possible, this drug should be dispensed in containers with child-resistant safety closures. Storage of this drug 
in the home must be supervised responsibly. If serious adverse effects occur, dosage should be reduced or treatment should be altered. Desipramine hydrochloride therapy in patients with 
manic-depressive illness may induce a hypomanic state after the depressive phase terminates. The drug may cause exacerbation of psychosis in schizophrenic patients. Both elevation and lowering of 
blood sugar levels have been reported. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Leukocyte and differential counts should be performed in any patient who develops fever and sore throat during therapy; the drug should
be discontinued if there is evidence of pathologic neutrophil depression. Clinical experience in the concurrent administration of ECT and antidepressant drugs is limited. Thus, if such treatment is 
essential, the possibility of increased risk relative to benefits should be considered. This drug should be discontinued as soon as possible prior to elective surgery because of possible 
cardiovascular effects. Hypertensive episodes have been observed during surgery in patients taking desipramine hydrochloride.

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: warnings: WARNINGS Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression 
and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until 
significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a 
long- standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. 
DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and others) showed that these drugs increase the
risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies 
did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 
and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term 
trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: The pooled analyses of placebo- controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 
295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an 
increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk 
differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 
patients treated) are provided in Table 1 . DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo 
<18 14 additional cases 18-24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer case ≥65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the 
adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several 
months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. DESIPRAMINE:
warnings: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in 
behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, 
insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with 
antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the 
worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. DESIPRAMINE: warnings:
Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent
suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting 
symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the 
need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such 
symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for desipramine hydrochloride should be written for the 
smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with desipramine hydrochloride or within 14 days of stopping treatment with 
desipramine hydrochloride is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of desipramine hydrochloride within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric 
disorders is also contraindicated ( see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Starting desipramine hydrochloride in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous 
methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Desipramine hydrochloride is contraindicated in the acute 
recovery period following myocardial infarction. It should not be used in those who have shown prior hypersensitivity to the drug. DESIPRAMINE: contraindications: Cross-sensitivity between this and 
other dibenzazepines is a possibility.

register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at http://womensmentalhealth. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: /clinical-and-research- 
programs/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants Safe use of desipramine hydrochloride during pregnancy and lactation has not been established; therefore, if it is to be given to pregnant patients, nursing 
mothers, or women of childbearing potential, the possible benefits must be weighed against the possible hazards to mother and child. Animal reproductive studies have been inconclusive. Geriatric Use 
Clinical studies of desipramine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported 
clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Lower doses are recommended for elderly patients. ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) The ratio
of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the elderly, most likely due to decreased renal elimination with aging. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: This drug is known to be substantially 
excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function,
care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Desipramine hydrochloride use in the elderly has been associated with a proneness to falling as well as 
confusional states (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and 
risks associated with treatment with desipramine hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious 
Mental illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for desipramine hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to 
read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any 
questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if 
these occur while taking desipramine hydrochloride. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to 
the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in 
behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be 
advised to observe for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, 
especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and 
behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Patients should be advised that taking desipramine hydrochloride can cause mild
pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle closure glaucoma, when 
diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open- angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible
to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established ( see BOX 
WARNING and WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Therefore, desipramine hydrochloride is not recommended for use in children. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Anyone considering the use of 
desipramine hydrochloride in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need (see also ADVERSE REACTIONS- Cardiovascular ). General It is important that this drug be 
dispensed in the least possible quantities to depressed outpatients, since suicide has been accomplished with this class of drug ( see WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Ordinary prudence
requires that children not have access to this drug or to potent drugs of any kind; if possible, this drug should be dispensed in containers with child-resistant safety closures. Storage of this drug 
in the home must be supervised responsibly. If serious adverse effects occur, dosage should be reduced or treatment should be altered. Desipramine hydrochloride therapy in patients with 
manic-depressive illness may induce a hypomanic state after the depressive phase terminates. The drug may cause exacerbation of psychosis in schizophrenic patients. Both elevation and lowering of 
blood sugar levels have been reported. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Leukocyte and differential counts should be performed in any patient who develops fever and sore throat during therapy; the drug should
be discontinued if there is evidence of pathologic neutrophil depression. Clinical experience in the concurrent administration of ECT and antidepressant drugs is limited. Thus, if such treatment is 
essential, the possibility of increased risk relative to benefits should be considered. This drug should be discontinued as soon as possible prior to elective surgery because of possible 
cardiovascular effects. Hypertensive episodes have been observed during surgery in patients taking desipramine hydrochloride.

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: warnings: WARNINGS Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression 
and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until 
significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a 
long- standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. 
DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and others) showed that these drugs increase the
risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies 
did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 
and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term 
trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: The pooled analyses of placebo- controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 
295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an 
increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk 
differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 
patients treated) are provided in Table 1 . DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo 
<18 14 additional cases 18-24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer case ≥65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the 
adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several 
months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. DESIPRAMINE:
warnings: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in 
behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, 
insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with 
antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the 
worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. DESIPRAMINE: warnings:
Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent
suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting 
symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the 
need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such 
symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for desipramine hydrochloride should be written for the 
smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with desipramine hydrochloride or within 14 days of stopping treatment with 
desipramine hydrochloride is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of desipramine hydrochloride within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric 
disorders is also contraindicated ( see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Starting desipramine hydrochloride in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous 
methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Desipramine hydrochloride is contraindicated in the acute 
recovery period following myocardial infarction. It should not be used in those who have shown prior hypersensitivity to the drug. DESIPRAMINE: contraindications: Cross-sensitivity between this and 
other dibenzazepines is a possibility.

        Question: Does DESIPRAMINE increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if DESIPRAMINE increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler responded by indicating that DESIPRAMINE is substantially excreted by the kidney and that the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. It suggests
caution in dose selection for patients with decreased renal function and that it may be useful to monitor renal function in such patients.
3. Although this does not directly state that DESIPRAMINE increases the risk of renal failure, it implies that there is a potential for increased risk in patients with existing renal impairment due to
the possibility of toxic reactions.
        -----
        Final answer: DESIPRAMINE may increase the risk of toxic reactions in patients with impaired renal function, suggesting a potential for increased risk of renal failure in this patient group. 
However, the FDA label does not explicitly state that DESIPRAMINE increases the risk of renal failure. It is recommended to use caution in dose selection and to monitor renal function in patients with
decreased renal function.

The question was whether DESIPRAMINE increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, DESIPRAMINE is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney,
and there may be a greater risk of toxic reactions to this drug in patients with impaired renal function. The FDA label advises caution in dose selection for patients with decreased renal function and
suggests that it may be useful to monitor renal function in such patients. While this information does not explicitly state that DESIPRAMINE increases the risk of renal failure, it implies that there 
is a potential for increased risk in patients with existing renal impairment due to the possibility of toxic reactions. Therefore, DESIPRAMINE may increase the risk of toxic reactions in patients with
impaired renal function, suggesting a potential for increased risk of renal failure in this patient group. However, the FDA label does not explicitly state that DESIPRAMINE increases the risk of renal
failure. It is recommended to use caution in dose selection and to monitor renal function in patients with decreased renal function.
