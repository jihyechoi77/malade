CONTENT: BACTRIM: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should only be 
used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, 
patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course 
of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole 
and trimethoprim) tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation. BACTRIM: 
information_for_patients: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can 
develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should 
contact their physician as soon as possible.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) 
tablets and other antibacterial drugs, Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by 
susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local 
epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to empiric selection of therapy. Urinary Tract Infections For the treatment of urinary tract infections due to susceptible strains of the 
following organisms: Escherichia coli , Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Morganella morganii , Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris . BACTRIM: indications_and_usage: It is recommended that 
initial episodes of uncomplicated urinary tract infections be treated with a single effective antibacterial agent rather than the combination. Acute Otitis Media For the treatment of acute otitis 
media in pediatric patients due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when in the judgment of the physician sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim offers some 
advantage over the use of other antimicrobial agents. To date, there are limited data on the safety of repeated use of BACTRIM in pediatric patients under two years of age. BACTRIM is not indicated 
for prophylactic or prolonged administration in otitis media at any age. BACTRIM: indications_and_usage: Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis in Adults For the treatment of acute exacerbations of
chronic bronchitis due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae when a physician deems that BACTRIM could offer some advantage over the use of a single 
antimicrobial agent. Shigellosis For the treatment of enteritis caused by susceptible strains of Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei when antibacterial therapy is indicated. Pneumocystis jirovecii 
Pneumonia For the treatment of documented Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and for prophylaxis against P. jirovecii pneumonia in individuals who are immunosuppressed and considered to be at an 
increased risk of developing P. jirovecii pneumonia. Traveler's Diarrhea in Adults For the treatment of traveler's diarrhea due to susceptible strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli .

CONTENT: BACTRIM: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected 
bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Folate Deficiency Avoid use of 
BACTRIM in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, in those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with 
malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states) and in those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly 
patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). BACTRIM: precautions: 
Hemolysis In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Hypoglycemia Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated
with BACTRIM are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving high doses of BACTRIM are particularly at 
risk. Impaired Phenylalanine Metabolism The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on 
appropriate dietary restriction. Porphyria and Hypothyroidism Like other drugs containing sulfonamides, BACTRIM can precipitate porphyria crisis and hypothyroidism. Avoid use of BACTRIM in patients 
with porphyria or thyroid dysfunction. BACTRIM: precautions: Potential Risk in the Treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) AIDS 
patients may not tolerate or respond to BACTRIM in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of adverse reactions, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase 
(transaminase) values, with BACTRIM therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for P. jirovecii pneumonia has been reported to be increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the
use of BACTRIM in non-AIDS patients. If a patient develops skin rash, fever, leukopenia or any sign of adverse reaction, reevaluate benefit-risk of continuing therapy or re-challenge with BACTRIM (see
WARNINGS ). Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM and leucovorin during treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia (see WARNINGS ). BACTRIM: precautions: Electrolyte Abnormalities Hyperkalemia : High dosage of 
trimethoprim, as used in patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with 
recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce 
hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Hyponatremia : Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving BACTRIM, 
particularly for the treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications. 
Crystalluria : During treatment, ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output to prevent crystalluria. BACTRIM: precautions: Patients who are “slow acetylators” may be more prone to idiosyncratic 
reactions to sulfonamides. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should only be used to treat 
bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients 
should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy
may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and 
trimethoprim) tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. BACTRIM: precautions: Patients should be instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone 
formation. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery 
and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their 
physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry testing should be done frequently in patients receiving BACTRIM. Perform urinalyses with careful 
microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function. Discontinue BACTRIM if a significant electrolyte abnormality, renal 
insufficiency or reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Potential for BACTRIM to Affect Other Drugs Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of 
CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2. Table 1: Drug Interactions 
with BACTRIM Drug(s) Recommendation Comments Diuretics Avoid concurrent use In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of 
thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Warfarin Monitor prothrombin time and INR It has been reported that BACTRIM may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the 
anticoagulant warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). BACTRIM: drug_interactions: This interaction should be kept in mind when BACTRIM is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation
time should be reassessed. Phenytoin Monitor serum phenytoin levels BACTRIM may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin (a CYP2C9 substrate). BACTRIM, given at a common clinical dosage, increased 
the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect. 
Methotrexate Avoid concurrent use Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free 
methotrexate concentrations. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Cyclosporine Avoid concurrent use There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration of BACTRIM and 
cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients. Digoxin Monitor serum digoxin levels Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. 
Indomethacin Avoid concurrent use Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin. Pyrimethamine Avoid concurrent use Occasional reports suggest that 
patients receiving pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if BACTRIM is prescribed. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) Monitor therapeutic 
response and adjust dose of TCA accordingly The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when coadministered with BACTRIM.

ANSWER: Bactrim is a synthetic antibacterial combination product containing sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. It is available in DS (double strength) tablets and regular tablets for oral 
administration. Bactrim is used to treat bacterial infections and should not be used for viral infections like the common cold. It is important for patients to complete the full course of therapy to 
prevent the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Bactrim is indicated for various infections, including urinary tract infections, acute otitis media in pediatric patients, acute exacerbations of 
chronic bronchitis in adults, shigellosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and traveler's diarrhea in adults. Patients should be cautioned about potential side effects such as diarrhea, which is 
common with antibiotics, and more serious conditions like watery and bloody stools. Precautions should be taken for patients with certain conditions such as impaired renal or hepatic function, folate 
deficiency, severe allergies, bronchial asthma, G6PD deficiency, and those at risk for electrolyte abnormalities. Bactrim can interact with other drugs, and caution should be used when coadministering
with drugs such as diuretics, warfarin, phenytoin, methotrexate, cyclosporine, digoxin, indomethacin, pyrimethamine, and tricyclic antidepressants.

Bactrim, which contains sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, does not specifically mention any effects on mortality after myocardial infarction (heart attack). Bactrim is indicated for various bacterial
infections and comes with a set of potential side effects and drug interactions, but there is no mention of its impact on mortality post-myocardial infarction.

Given that the FDA label data does not specify the answer to the question of whether Bactrim increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, I must provide a DO-NOT-KNOW 
response.

To summarize, the steps taken to derive this answer were:
1. I requested information from FDAHandler about Bactrim.
2. FDAHandler provided details on Bactrim's indications, side effects, and drug interactions.
3. There was no mention of Bactrim's impact on mortality after myocardial infarction in the information provided.

Therefore, based on the FDA label data, I cannot determine whether Bactrim increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.

The question was whether Bactrim increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, there is no specific mention of the effects 
of Bactrim on mortality post-myocardial infarction in the FDA label data. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this data whether Bactrim has an impact on mortality after a heart attack. The
answer to the question is DO-NOT-KNOW.
