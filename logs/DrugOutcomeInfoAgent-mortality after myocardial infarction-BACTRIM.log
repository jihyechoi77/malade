[32mThe question was whether Bactrim increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, there is no specific mention of the effects [0m
[32mof Bactrim on mortality post-myocardial infarction in the FDA label data. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this data whether Bactrim has an impact on mortality after a heart attack. The[0m
[32manswer to the question is DO-NOT-KNOW.[0m
