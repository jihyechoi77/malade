                Passages:
                1. Drug DOXEPIN HCL: The FDAHandler has indicated that the FDA label for Doxepin HCL does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. This suggests
that there may not be any verified effect on the risk of myocardial infarction, or that such an effect has not been sufficiently studied or documented to be included in the label.

 DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for Doxepin HCL does not provide information on whether it increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question 
based on the FDA label data.
2. Drug DESIPRAMINE: DESIPRAMINE is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, especially in patients in the acute recovery period following a myocardial infarction or those with 
cardiovascular disease. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which indicates that DESIPRAMINE is contraindicated in the acute recovery period following myocardial infarction and 
that extreme caution is advised when it is given to patients with cardiovascular disease due to the possibility of conduction defects, arrhythmias, tachycardias, strokes, and acute myocardial 
infarction.
3. Drug AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, as indicated in the adverse reactions section of its drug label.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that for Doxepin HCL, there is no specified effect on the risk of myocardial infarction according to the FDA label.
2. Passage 2 states that Desipramine is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, especially in certain patients, according to FDAHandler.
3. Passage 3 reports that Amitriptyline HCL is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction as indicated in the drug label.
4. Given that two out of the three drugs mentioned (Desipramine and Amitriptyline HCL) are associated with an increased risk, and one drug (Doxepin HCL) has no specified effect, it can be inferred 
that the tricyclic antidepressant category has a potential to increase the risk of myocardial infarction.
