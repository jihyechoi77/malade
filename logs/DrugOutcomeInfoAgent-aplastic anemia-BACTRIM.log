CONTENT: BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of BACTRIM or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were identified in clinical trials, 
postmarketing or published reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or 
establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and 
urticaria). BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Fatalities and serious adverse reactions, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; 
agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
products, including BACTRIM(see WARNINGS ). BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic 
anemia, hypoprothrombinemia, methemoglobinemia, eosinophilia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Allergic Reactions: Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, anaphylaxis, allergic myocarditis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, drug fever, chills, Henoch-Schoenlein purpura, serum sickness-like 
syndrome, generalized allergic reactions, generalized skin eruptions, photosensitivity, conjunctival and scleral injection, pruritus, urticaria, rash, periarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP), and acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND) (see WARNINGS ).

CONTENT: BACTRIM: precautions: Animal Data In rats, oral doses of either 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly as cleft palates. These 
doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole was 
used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the 
human therapeutic dose based on body surface area. Nonteratogenic Effects See CONTRAINDICATIONS section. Nursing Mothers Levels of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in breast milk are approximately 
2–5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. BACTRIM: precautions: Caution should be exercised when BACTRIM is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding 
jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus. Pediatric Use BACTRIM is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of 
age (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they 
respond differently from younger subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or
liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. BACTRIM: precautions: Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS 
sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving 
certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially
in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid 
therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). BACTRIM: precautions: The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, 
with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in 
these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Bactrim Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Bactrim DS Tablets 
contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. BACTRIM: precautions: The mean maximum 
serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric 
Pharmacokinetics ).

CONTENT: BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Potential for BACTRIM to Affect Other Drugs Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor 
of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2. Table 1: Drug Interactions with BACTRIM Drug(s) Recommendation Comments Diuretics Avoid 
concurrent use In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Warfarin Monitor 
prothrombin time and INR It has been reported that BACTRIM may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). BACTRIM: drug_interactions: 
This interaction should be kept in mind when BACTRIM is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed. Phenytoin Monitor serum phenytoin levels 
BACTRIM may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin (a CYP2C9 substrate). BACTRIM, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic
clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect. Methotrexate Avoid concurrent use Sulfonamides can also displace 
methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Cyclosporine 
Avoid concurrent use There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration of BACTRIM and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients. Digoxin Monitor serum digoxin 
levels Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Indomethacin Avoid concurrent use Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in
patients who are also receiving indomethacin. Pyrimethamine Avoid concurrent use Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly
may develop megaloblastic anemia if BACTRIM is prescribed. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) Monitor therapeutic response and adjust dose of TCA accordingly The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants 
can decrease when coadministered with BACTRIM. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Oral Hypoglycemics Monitor blood glucose more frequently Like other sulfonamide-containing drugs, BACTRIM potentiates the 
effect of oral hypoglycemic that are metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone) or CYP2C9 (e.g., glipizide and glyburide) or eliminated renally via OCT2 (e.g., 
metformin). Additional monitoring of blood glucose may be warranted. Amantadine Avoid concurrent use In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium has been reported after concomitant intake of 
BACTRIM and amantadine (an OCT2 substrate). Cases of interactions with other OCT2 substrates, memantine and metformin, have also been reported. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Angiotensin Converting 
Enzyme Inhibitors Avoid concurrent use In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been reported after concomitant intake of BACTRIM and an angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitor. 5,6 Zidovudine Monitor for hematologic toxicity Zidovudine and BACTRIM are known to induce hematological abnormalities. Hence, there is potential for an additive myelotoxicity when 
coadministered. 7 Dofetilide Concurrent administration is contraindicated Elevated plasma concentrations of dofetilide have been reported following concurrent administration of trimethoprim and 
dofetilide. Increased plasma concentrations of dofetilide may cause serious ventricular arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation, including torsade de pointes .

CONTENT: BACTRIM: warnings: WARNINGS Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions Fatalities and serious adverse reactions including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous 
pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the 
administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates potentially representing hypersensitivity
reactions of the respiratory tract have been reported in association with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment. BACTRIM: warnings: Other severe pulmonary adverse reactions occurring within days
to week of BACTRIM initiation and resulting in prolonged respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), lung transplantation or death have also 
been reported in patients and otherwise healthy individuals treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products. Circulatory shock with fever, severe hypotension, and confusion requiring 
intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors has occurred within minutes to hours of re-challenge with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM, in patients with history of 
recent (days to weeks) exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. BACTRIM should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of a serious adverse reaction. BACTRIM: warnings: 
A skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, AFND, AGEP, hepatic necrosis, or serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS 
and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Clinical signs, such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions. 
Thrombocytopenia BACTRIM-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually 
resolves within a week upon discontinuation of BACTRIM. BACTRIM: warnings: Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group A β-hemolytic 
streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever. Clostridioides difficile Associated 
Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including BACTRIM, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal 
colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of 
CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. BACTRIM: warnings:
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the 
administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte 
management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk Associated with Concurrent Use of Leucovorin for 
Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia Treatment failure and excess mortality were observed when BACTRIM was used concomitantly with leucovorin for the treatment of HIV positive patients with P. jirovecii 
pneumonia in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. 4 Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM and leucovorin during treatment of P . jirovecii pneumonia.

BACTRIM has been associated with an increased risk of aplastic anemia. This information comes from the BACTRIM label, which lists aplastic anemia among other blood dyscrasias that have occurred with 
the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products. However, it is important to note that the frequency of this adverse reaction is not reliably estimated due to voluntary reporting from
an uncertain population size.
