CONTENT: ATENOLOL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse effects have been mild and transient. The frequency estimates in the following table were derived from controlled studies in 
hypertensive patients in which adverse reactions were either volunteered by the patient (US studies) or elicited, e.g., by checklist (foreign studies). The reported frequency of elicited adverse 
effects was higher for both atenolol and placebo-treated patients than when these reactions were volunteered. Where frequency of adverse effects of atenolol and placebo is similar, causal relationship
to atenolol is uncertain. Volunteered ( US Studies ) Total-Volunteered and Elicited ( Foreign + US Studies ) Atenolol (n = 164) % Placebo (n = 206) % Atenolol (n = 399) % Placebo (n = 407) %

of psoriasis, psychoses, purpura, reversible alopecia, thrombocytopenia, visual disturbance, sick sinus syndrome, and dry mouth. Atenolol, like other beta blockers, has been associated with the 
development of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), lupus syndrome, and Raynaudâ€™s phenomenon.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with atenolol has been reported with patients surviving acute doses as high as 5 g. One death was reported in a man who may have taken as much as 
10 g acutely. The predominant symptoms reported following atenolol overdose are lethargy, disorder of respiratory drive, wheezing, sinus pause and bradycardia. Additionally, common effects associated 
with overdosage of any beta-adrenergic blocking agent and which might also be expected in atenolol overdose are congestive heart failure, hypotension, bronchospasm and/or hypoglycemia. Treatment of 
overdose should be directed to the removal of any unabsorbed drug by induced emesis, gastric lavage, or administration of activated charcoal. Atenolol can be removed from the general circulation by 
hemodialysis. ATENOLOL: overdosage: Other treatment modalities should be employed at the physician's discretion and may include: BRADYCARDIA: Atropine intravenously. If there is no response to vagal 
blockade, give isoproterenol cautiously. In refractory cases, a transvenous cardiac pacemaker may be indicated. HEART BLOCK (SECOND OR THIRD DEGREE): Isoproterenol or transvenous cardiac pacemaker. 
CARDIAC FAILURE: Digitalize the patient and administer a diuretic. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. HYPOTENSION: Vasopressors such as dopamine or norepinephrine (levarterenol). Monitor blood 
pressure continuously. BRONCHOSPASM: A beta 2 stimulant such as isoproterenol or terbutaline and/or aminophylline. HYPOGLYCEMIA: Intravenous glucose. ATENOLOL: overdosage: Based on the severity of 
symptoms, management may require intensive support care and facilities for applying cardiac and respiratory support.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: warnings: Since beta 1 selectivity is not absolute, the lowest possible dose of atenolol should be used with therapy initiated at 50 mg and a beta 2 - stimulating agent 
(bronchodilator) should be made available. If dosage must be increased, dividing the dose should be considered in order to achieve lower peak blood levels. Major Surgery Chronically administered 
beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general 
anesthesia and surgical procedures. Diabetes and Hypoglycemia Atenolol should be used with caution in diabetic patients if a beta-blocking agent is required. Beta blockers may mask tachycardia 
occurring with hypoglycemia, but other manifestations such as dizziness and sweating may not be significantly affected. ATENOLOL: warnings: At recommended doses atenolol does not potentiate 
insulin-induced hypoglycemia and, unlike nonselective beta blockers, does not delay recovery of blood glucose to normal levels. Thyrotoxicosis Beta-adrenergic blockade may mask certain clinical signs 
(e.g., tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockade might precipitate a thyroid storm; therefore, patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis from whom atenolol therapy is 
to be withdrawn should be monitored closely (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Untreated Pheochromocytoma Atenolol should not be given to patients with untreated pheochromocytoma. Pregnancy and Fetal 
Injury Atenolol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Atenolol crosses the placental barrier and appears in cord blood. ATENOLOL: warnings: Administration of atenolol, starting 
in the second trimester of pregnancy, has been associated with the birth of infants that are small for gestational age. No studies have been performed on the use of atenolol in the first trimester and
the possibility of fetal injury cannot be excluded. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential 
hazard to the fetus. Neonates born to mothers who are receiving atenolol at parturition or breast-feeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia and bradycardia. Caution should be exercised when atenolol is 
administered during pregnancy or to a woman who is breast-feeding (see PRECAUTIONS / Nursing Mothers ). ATENOLOL: warnings: Atenolol has been shown to produce a dose-related increase in embryo/fetal 
resorptions in rats at doses equal to or greater than 50 mg/kg/day or 25 or more times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * . Although similar effects were not seen in rabbits, the 
compound was not evaluated in rabbits at doses above 25 mg/kg/day or 12.5 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * .

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: Pharmacodynamics In standard animal or human pharmacological tests, beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity of atenolol has been demonstrated by: (1) reduction in 
resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol induced tachycardia, and (4) 
reduction in reflex orthostatic tachycardia. A significant beta-blocking effect of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise tachycardia, is apparent within one hour following oral administration
of a single dose. This effect is maximal at about 2 to 4 hours, and persists for at least 24 hours. Maximum reduction in exercise tachycardia occurs within 5 minutes of an intravenous dose. ATENOLOL: 
pharmacodynamics: For both orally and intravenously administered drug, the duration of action is dose related and also bears a linear relationship to the logarithm of plasma atenolol concentration. 
The effect on exercise tachycardia of a single 10 mg intravenous dose is largely dissipated by 12 hours, whereas beta-blocking activity of single oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg is still evident beyond
24 hours following administration. However, as has been shown for all beta-blocking agents, the antihypertensive effect does not appear to be related to plasma level. In normal subjects, the beta1 
selectivity of atenolol has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent betab-locking doses of propranolol. ATENOLOL:
pharmacodynamics: In asthmatic patients, a dose of atenolol producing a greater effect on resting heart rate than propranolol resulted in much less increase in airway resistance. In a placebo 
controlled comparison of approximately equipotent oral doses of several beta blockers, atenolol produced a significantly smaller decrease of FEV1 than nonselective beta blockers such as propranolol 
and, unlike those agents, did not inhibit bronchodilation in response to isoproterenol. Consistent with its negative chronotropic effect due to beta blockade of the SA node, atenolol increases sinus 
cycle length and sinus node recovery time. Conduction in the AV node is also prolonged. Atenolol is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity, and increasing the dose well beyond that producing beta 
blockade does not further depress myocardial contractility. Several studies have demonstrated a moderate (approximately 10%) increase in stroke volume at rest and during exercise. ATENOLOL: 
pharmacodynamics: In controlled clinical trials, atenolol, given as a single daily oral dose, was an effective antihypertensive agent providing 24-hour reduction of blood pressure. Atenolol has been 
studied in combination with thiazide-type diuretics, and the blood pressure effects of the combination are approximately additive. Atenolol is also compatible with methyldopa, hydralazine, and 
prazosin, each combination resulting in a larger fall in blood pressure than with the single agents. The dose range of atenolol is narrow and increasing the dose beyond 100 mg once daily is not 
associated with increased antihypertensive effect. The mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents have not been established. ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: Several possible 
mechanisms have been proposed and include: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output, (2) a central 
effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery, and (3) suppression of renin activity. The results from long-term studies have not shown any diminution of the antihypertensive efficacy
of atenolol with prolonged use. By blocking the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines and by decreasing blood pressure, atenolol generally reduces the oxygen requirements of 
the heart at any given level of effort, making it useful for many patients in the long-term management of angina pectoris. On the other hand, atenolol can increase oxygen requirements by increasing 
left ventricular fiber length and end diastolic pressure, particularly in patients with heart failure. ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: In a multicenter clinical trial (ISIS-1) conducted in 16,027 patients
with suspected myocardial infarction, patients presenting within 12 hours (mean = 5 hours) after the onset of pain were randomized to either conventional therapy plus atenolol (n = 8,037), or 
conventional therapy alone (n = 7,990). Patients with a heart rate of < 50 bpm or systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg, or with other contraindications to beta blockade were excluded. Thirty-eight 
percent of each group were treated within 4 hours of onset of pain. The mean time from onset of pain to entry was 5.0 Â± 2.7 hours in both groups. ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: Patients in the atenolol 
group were to receive atenolol injection 5 to 10 mg given over 5 minutes plus atenolol tablets 50 mg every 12 hours orally on the first study day (the first oral dose administered about 15 minutes 
after the IV dose) followed by either atenolol tablets 100 mg once daily or atenolol tablets 50 mg twice daily on days 2 to 7. The groups were similar in demographic and medical history 
characteristics and in electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction, bundle branch block, and first degree atrioventricular block at entry. During the treatment period (days 0 to 7), the 
vascular mortality rates were 3.89% in the atenolol group (313 deaths) and 4.57% in the control group (365 deaths). This absolute difference in rates, 0.68%, is statistically significant at the P< 0.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: nursing_mothers: Nursing Mothers Atenolol is excreted in human breast milk at a ratio of 1.5 to 6.8 when compared to the concentration in plasma. Caution should be exercised when 
atenolol is administered to a nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in breast fed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely 
to develop adverse effects. Neonates born to mothers who are receiving atenolol at parturition or breast-feeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia and bradycardia. Caution should be exercised when 
atenolol is administered during pregnancy or to a woman who is breast-feeding (see WARNING, Pregnancy and Fetal Injury ).

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: spl_unclassified_section: POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS In addition, a variety of adverse effects have been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and may be considered 
potential adverse effects of atenolol. Hematologic Agranulocytosis. Allergic Fever, combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, and respiratory distress. Central Nervous System Reversible 
mental depression progressing to catatonia; an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation of time and place; short-term memory loss; emotional lability with slightly clouded sensorium; 
and, decreased performance on neuropsychometrics. Gastrointestinal Mesenteric arterial thrombosis, ischemic colitis. Other Erythematous rash. Miscellaneous There have been reports of skin rashes 
and/or dry eyes associated with the use of beta-adrenergic blocking drugs. The reported incidence is small, and in most cases, the symptoms have cleared when treatment was withdrawn. ATENOLOL: 
spl_unclassified_section: Discontinuance of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. Patients should be closely monitored following cessation of therapy (see 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The oculomucocutaneous syndrome associated with the beta blocker practolol has not been reported with atenolol. Furthermore, a number of patients who had previously 
demonstrated established practolol reactions were transferred to atenolol therapy with subsequent resolution or quiescence of the reaction.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General Patients already on a beta blocker must be evaluated carefully before atenolol is administered. Initial and subsequent atenolol dosages can be 
adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Atenolol may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders. Impaired Renal Function The drug should be 
used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given 
with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with atenolol plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce 
vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Calcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with atenolol (see WARNINGS ). ATENOLOL: precautions: Disopyramide is a Type I 
antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers. 
Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers. Beta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension, which can 
follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta 
blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped. Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, e.g., 
indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers. ATENOLOL: precautions: Information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited. Data from several studies, i.e., 
TIMI-II, ISIS-2, currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and beta blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting. While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of 
anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual 
doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction. Both digitalis glycosides and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of
bradycardia. ATENOLOL: precautions: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two long-term (maximum dosing duration of 18 or 24 months) rat studies and one long-term (maximum dosing 
duration of 18 months) mouse study, each employing dose levels as high as 300 mg/kg/day or 150 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * , did not indicate a carcinogenic potential 
of atenolol. A third (24 month) rat study, employing doses of 500 and 1,500 mg/kg/day (250 and 750 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * ) resulted in increased incidences of 
benign adrenal medullary tumors in males and females, mammary fibroadenomas in females, and anterior pituitary adenomas and thyroid parafollicular cell carcinomas in males. ATENOLOL: precautions: No 
evidence of a mutagenic potential of atenolol was uncovered in the dominant lethal test (mouse), in vivo cytogenetics test (Chinese hamster) or Ames test (S. typhimurium). Fertility of male or female 
rats (evaluated at dose levels as high as 200 mg/kg/day or 100 times the maximum recommended human dose * ) was unaffected by atenolol administration. Animal Toxicology Chronic studies employing oral 
atenolol performed in animals have revealed the occurrence of vacuolation of epithelial cells of Brunner's glands in the duodenum of both male and female dogs at all tested dose levels of atenolol 
(starting at 15 mg/kg/day or 7. ATENOLOL: precautions: 5 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * ) and increased incidence of atrial degeneration of hearts of male rats at 300 but 
not 150 mg atenolol/kg/day (150 and 75 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * , respectively). ________________________________________________________________________ * Based on 
the maximum dose of 100 mg/day in a 50 kg patient. Usage in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D : See WARNINGS - Pregnancy and Fetal Injury. Nursing Mothers Atenolol is excreted in human breast milk at a 
ratio of 1.5 to 6.8 when compared to the concentration in plasma. Caution should be exercised when atenolol is administered to a nursing woman. Clinically significant bradycardia has been reported in 
breast fed infants. Premature infants, or infants with impaired renal function, may be more likely to develop adverse effects. ATENOLOL: precautions: Neonates born to mothers who are receiving 
atenolol at parturition or breast-feeding may be at risk for hypoglycemia and bradycardia. Caution should be exercised when atenolol is administered during pregnancy or to a woman who is 
breast-feeding (see WARNING, Pregnancy and Fetal Injury ). Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Hypertension and Angina Pectoris Due to
Coronary Atherosclerosis Clinical studies of atenolol did not include sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported
clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the 
low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. ATENOLOL: precautions: Acute 
Myocardial Infarction Of the 8,037 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomized to atenolol in the ISIS-1 trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ), 33% (2,644) were 65 years of age and 
older. It was not possible to identify significant differences in efficacy and safety between older and younger patients; however, elderly patients with systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg seemed less 
likely to benefit (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ). In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency 
of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment 
of renal function.

        Question: Does ATENOLOL increase or decrease the risk of acute liver injury?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether ATENOLOL increases the risk of acute liver injury.
2. FDAHandler responded that the ATENOLOL label does not indicate an increased risk of acute liver injury. However, during postmarketing experience, elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin have been 
reported, which could suggest liver involvement but is not specified as acute liver injury.

The FDA label for ATENOLOL does not indicate that it increases the risk of acute liver injury. However, during postmarketing experience, there have been reports of elevated liver enzymes and/or 
bilirubin, which could suggest liver involvement, but this is not specified as acute liver injury. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether ATENOLOL increases or decreases the risk of acute liver
injury based on the available FDA label information.
