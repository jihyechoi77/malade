[31mpharmacodynamics: For both orally and intravenously administered drug, the duration of action is dose related and also bears a linear relationship to the logarithm of plasma atenolol concentration. [0m
[31mThe effect on exercise tachycardia of a single [0m[1;31m10[0m[31m mg intravenous dose is largely dissipated by [0m[1;31m12[0m[31m hours, whereas beta-blocking activity of single oral doses of [0m[1;31m50[0m[31m mg and [0m[1;31m100[0m[31m mg is still evident beyond[0m

[31mselectivity of atenolol has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent betab-locking doses of propranolol. ATENOLOL:[0m
[31mpharmacodynamics: In asthmatic patients, a dose of atenolol producing a greater effect on resting heart rate than propranolol resulted in much less increase in airway resistance. In a placebo [0m
