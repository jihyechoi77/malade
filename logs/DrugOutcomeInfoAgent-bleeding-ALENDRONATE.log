[32mThe FDA label for ALENDRONATE does not directly address whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of systemic bleeding. It does mention the possibility of esophageal adverse experiences, which [0m
[32mcan include bleeding, but this is specifically related to irritation and injury to the esophagus, not a general bleeding risk. Therefore, based on the available FDA label information, it is not [0m
