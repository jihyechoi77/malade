CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS All-Cause Mortality: A meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials demonstrated an increase in all-cause mortality in 
tigecycline for injection-treated patients compared to controls with a risk difference of 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.2). The cause of this increase has not been established. An increase was also seen in a 
meta-analysis limited to the approved indications [0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2)]. The greatest difference in mortality was seen in tigecycline for injection-treated patients with ventilator-associated 
pneumonia. ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: have been reported with tigecycline for injection and may be life-threatening. Avoid use in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines. ( 5.
TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 3 ) Hepatic Adverse Effects: have been reported with tigecycline for injection. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during tigecycline for injection 
therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline therapy. ( 5.4 ) Pancreatitis: including fatalities, has been reported 
with tigecycline for injection. If pancreatitis is suspected, then consider stopping tigecycline for injection. ( 5.5 ) Monitoring Blood Coagulation Parameters: Hypofibrinogenemia has been reported 
with tigecycline for injection. Monitor blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen, at baseline and regularly during treatment with tigecycline for injection. ( 5. TIGECYCLINE: 
warnings_and_cautions: 6 ) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia: The use of tigecycline for injection during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 
years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia. ( 5.7 ) Inhibition of Bone Growth: The use of tigecycline for injection during the second and third 
trimester of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. ( 5.8 ) Clostridium difficile associated Diarrhea (CDAD): evaluate if diarrhea 
occurs. (5.9 ) 5.1 All-Cause Mortality An increase in all-cause mortality has been observed in a meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials in tigecycline for injection-treated patients versus 
comparator-treated patients.

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and 
electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.10 Sepsis/Septic Shock in 
Patients With Intestinal Perforation Monotherapy with tigecycline should be avoided in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) secondary to clinically apparent intestinal 
perforation. In cIAI studies (n=1642), 6 patients treated with tigecycline for injection and 2 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin presented with intestinal perforations and developed 
sepsis/septic shock. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: The 6 patients treated with tigecycline for injection had higher APACHE II scores (median = 13) versus the 2 patients treated with 
imipenem/cilastatin (APACHE II scores = 4 and 6). Due to differences in baseline APACHE II scores between treatment groups and small overall numbers, the relationship of this outcome to treatment 
cannot be established. 5.11 Tetracycline-Class Adverse Effects Tigecycline for injection is structurally similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse effects. Such 
effects may include: photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic action (which has led to increased BUN, azotemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia). 5. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions:
12 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing tigecycline for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and 
increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

        Question: Does TIGECYCLINE increase or decrease the risk of bleeding?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if TIGECYCLINE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.
2. FDAHandler responded that tigecycline may affect blood coagulation parameters, as hypofibrinogenemia has been reported with its use. Patients are advised to monitor blood coagulation parameters, 
including fibrinogen, at baseline and regularly during treatment with tigecycline.
        -----
        Final answer: Tigecycline may increase the risk of bleeding due to its potential effect on blood coagulation parameters, specifically by causing hypofibrinogenemia. Patients taking tigecycline
should monitor their blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen levels.
