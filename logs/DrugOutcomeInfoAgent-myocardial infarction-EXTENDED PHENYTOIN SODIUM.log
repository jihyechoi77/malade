CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: John’s wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, 
valproate sodium c , valproic acid c a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John’s wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic 
acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by 
phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy 
with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting
Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide 
Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance . Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, 
pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered 
phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Prevention or Management: Patients should be 
monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Warfarin Increased and 
decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is co-administered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, 
rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate,
lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, 
nelfin EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: avir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active 
metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, 
verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of 
phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: 3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate 
Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding 
preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding 
preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to 
measure serum phenytoin concentrations.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy
Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal 
hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been
reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, 
including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and 
other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy:
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an 
approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital 
hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

valproate sodium c , valproic acid c a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John’s wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic 
acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by 
phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy 
with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting
Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide 
Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance . Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, 
pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered 
phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Prevention or Management: Patients should be 
monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Warfarin Increased and 
decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is co-administered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, 
rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate,

nelfin EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: avir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active 
metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, 
verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of 
phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: 3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate 
Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding 
preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding 
preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to 
measure serum phenytoin concentrations.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy
Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal 
hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been
reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, 
including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and 
other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy:
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an 
approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital 
hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
        else to say, you MUST EXIT IMMEDIATELY by stating that you are done
        with the usual code (as in #3).

        Question: Does EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increase or decrease the risk of myocardial infarction?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.
2. FDAHandler responded that the EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of myocardial infarction.
3. The label does note that EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can cause heart problems, including a slow heartbeat, and lists symptoms that could indicate heart issues, but it does not explicitly link the 
drug to myocardial infarction.

The FDAHandler has indicated that the available information from the EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of myocardial infarction as a 
result of using the drug. The label does note that EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can cause heart problems, including a slow heartbeat, and lists symptoms that could indicate heart issues, but it does not 
explicitly link the drug to myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, it is not possible to determine whether EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of 
myocardial infarction.
