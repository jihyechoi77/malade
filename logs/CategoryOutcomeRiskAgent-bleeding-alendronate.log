                1. Drug ALENDRONATE SODIUM: Alendronate Sodium may increase the risk of bleeding, but this is specifically in the context of upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions such as 
esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, and esophageal erosions. There is no specific mention of a general increased risk of bleeding outside of these gastrointestinal events according to the FDA label data.
2. Drug ALENDRONATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ALENDRONATE does not directly address whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of systemic bleeding. It does mention the possibility of esophageal adverse experiences, which 
can include bleeding, but this is specifically related to irritation and injury to the esophagus, not a general bleeding risk. Therefore, based on the available FDA label information, it is not 
possible to determine the effect of ALENDRONATE on the risk of bleeding.

                Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of
                bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that Alendronate Sodium may increase the risk of bleeding in the context of upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, and 
esophageal erosions, according to FDA label data.
2. Passage 1 also states that there is no mention of a general increased risk of bleeding outside of these gastrointestinal events.
3. Passage 2 indicates that the FDA label for Alendronate does not directly address whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of systemic bleeding but does mention the possibility of esophageal
adverse experiences, which can include bleeding.
4. Passage 2 concludes that it is not possible to determine the effect of Alendronate on the risk of bleeding based on the available FDA label information.
5. Both passages suggest that there is a potential for increased risk of bleeding, but this is specifically related to gastrointestinal events and not a systemic effect.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the alendronate category of drugs on the risk of systemic bleeding. However, there may be an increased risk of bleeding associated with upper 
gastrointestinal adverse reactions.
