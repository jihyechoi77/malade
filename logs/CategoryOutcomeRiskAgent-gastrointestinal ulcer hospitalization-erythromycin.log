                Passages:
                1. Drug ERYTHROMYCIN: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data does not specify whether ERYTHROMYCIN increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question 
based on the available data.
2. Drug ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question asked was whether ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. I attempted to obtain information from FDAHandler using the 
recipient_message tool to inquire about the effects of ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. However, there was no response from FDAHandler, which means 
there is no information available from the FDA label data to determine the effect of ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, the final answer is 
DO-NOT-KNOW.
3. Drug ERYTHROMYCIN: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question asked was whether the use of erythromycin increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. I attempted to retrieve this information from the FDAHandler, but it 
seems there was an issue with the communication or the data retrieval process, as no response was provided. Without specific data from the FDA label, I cannot provide a reliable answer to this 
question. Therefore, my final answer must be "DO-NOT-KNOW."
                ---------
                Does the erythromycin category of drugs increase the risk of
                gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the erythromycin category of drugs increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passages provided do not contain any specific information regarding the effect of erythromycin or erythromycin ethylsuccinate on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
2. The FDA label data for these drugs does not specify whether they increase or decrease the risk.
3. Attempts to obtain information from the FDAHandler were unsuccessful, leading to a 'DO-NOT-KNOW' status for both drugs.
4. Since there is no available data from the FDA label or other sources provided, it is not possible to determine the effect of the erythromycin category of drugs on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer
hospitalization.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the erythromycin category of drugs on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization due to lack of specific information.
