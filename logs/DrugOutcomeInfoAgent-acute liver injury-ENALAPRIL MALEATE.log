CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or 
without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or
ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with 
abdominal pain. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and 
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening 
anaphylactoid reactions. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent 
rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. 
Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Excessive hypotension is rare in uncomplicated 
hypertensive patients treated with enalapril maleate alone. Patients with heart failure given enalapril maleate commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, especially with the first dose, but 
discontinuation of therapy for continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed; caution should be observed when initiating therapy (see DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Patients at risk for excessive hypotension, sometimes associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or 
death, include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure, hyponatremia, high-dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive diuresis or increase in diuretic dose, renal dialysis, 
or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology. It may be advisable to eliminate the diuretic (except in patients with heart failure), reduce the diuretic dose or increase salt intake 
cautiously before initiating therapy with enalapril maleate in patients at risk for excessive hypotension who are able to tolerate such adjustments (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE 
REACTIONS ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: In patients at risk for excessive hypotension, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for
the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of enalapril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations may apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease, in whom 
an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if 
necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses of enalapril maleate, which usually can be given without 
difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. If symptomatic hypotension develops, a dose reduction or discontinuation of enalapril maleate or concomitant diuretic may be necessary. ENALAPRIL 
MALEATE: warnings: Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated 
patients but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen vascular disease. Available data from clinical trials of enalapril are insufficient to show that
enalapril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Marketing experience has revealed cases of neutropenia or agranulocytosis in which a causal relationship to enalapril cannot be excluded. 
Periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in patients with collagen vascular disease and renal disease should be considered. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a 
syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: 
Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. Fetal Toxicity Use of 
drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting 
oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When
pregnancy is detected, discontinue enalapril maleate as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. 
ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the 
renin-angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the 
unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. 
Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue enalapril maleate, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal
testing may be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible 
injury. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to enalapril maleate for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use ). No 
teratogenic effects of enalapril were seen in studies of pregnant rats and rabbits. On a body surface area basis, the doses used were 57 times and 12 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human
daily dose (MRHDD).

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients appears to be similar to that seen in adult patients. Clinical Laboratory Test 
Findings Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Hyperkalemia ), hyponatremia. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen In controlled clinical trials minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum 
creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in about 0.2 percent of patients with essential hypertension treated with enalapril maleate alone. Increases are more likely to 
occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics or in patients with renal artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS, Impaired Renal Function ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: In patients with heart 
failure who were also receiving diuretics with or without digitalis, increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine, usually reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril maleate and/or other 
concomitant diuretic therapy, were observed in about 11 percent of patients. Increases in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine were a cause for discontinuation in 1.2 percent of patients. Hematology 
Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.3 g percent and 1 vol percent, respectively) occur frequently in either hypertension or congestive heart failure 
patients treated with enalapril maleate but are rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexists. In clinical trials, less than 0.1 percent of patients discontinued therapy due to
anemia. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: Hemolytic anemia, including cases of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency, has been reported; a causal relationship to enalapril cannot be excluded.
Liver Function Tests Elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred (see WARNINGS, Hepatic Failure ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Northstar Rx LLC at

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: boxed_warning: WARNING: FETAL TOXICITY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue enalapril maleate tablets, USP 
as soon as possible. Drugs that act directly on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and death to the developing fetus. (See WARNINGS, Fetal Toxicity .

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Neprilysin Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS ). Dual 
Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, 
hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit 
compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on enalapril maleate and other agents that 
affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with enalapril maleate in patients with diabetes. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: Avoid use of aliskiren with enalapril maleate in patients with 
renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min). Hypotension—Patients on Diuretic Therapy Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an 
excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with enalapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with enalapril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or 
increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, provide close medical supervision after the initial dose for at least two hours
and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS , Hypotension and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Agents Causing Renin Release The antihypertensive effect of 
enalapril maleate is augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release (e. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: ., diuretics). Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective 
Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, 
including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including enalapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually 
reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving enalapril and NSAID therapy. In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to hypertensive patients 
receiving enalapril maleate. In this study there was no evidence of a blunting of the antihypertensive action of enalapril maleate. However, reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the 
antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors.

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are
effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate and thiazides are approximately 
additive. Heart Failure Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients 
enalapril maleate improves symptoms, increases survival, and decreases the frequency of hospitalization (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of 
survival trials). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 
≤35 percent), enalapril maleate tablets, USP decreases the rate of development of overt heart failure and decreases the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart
Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of survival trials). In using enalapril maleate, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 
captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that enalapril maleate does not 
have a similar risk (see WARNINGS , Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: In considering use of enalapril maleate, it should be noted that in controlled clinical 
trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, it should be noted that black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been 
reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ).         
SOURCE:ENALAPRIL MALEATE label


CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Hypertension Administration of enalapril maleate to patients with hypertension of severity ranging from mild to 
severe results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure usually with no orthostatic component. Symptomatic postural hypotension is therefore infrequent, although it might be 
anticipated in volume-depleted patients (see WARNINGS, Hypotension ). In most patients studied, after oral administration of a single dose of enalapril, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at 
one hour with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by four to six hours. At recommended doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours. In some patients the effects 
may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Hypertension ). In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require several weeks of 
therapy. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: The antihypertensive effects of enalapril maleate have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of enalapril maleate has not been associated 
with a rapid increase in blood pressure. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with 
an increase in cardiac output and little or no change in heart rate. Following administration of enalapril maleate, there is an increase in renal blood flow; glomerular filtration rate is usually 
unchanged. The effects appear to be similar in patients with renovascular hypertension. When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate are 
approximately additive. In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to hypertensive patients receiving enalapril maleate. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: In this 
study there was no evidence of a blunting of the antihypertensive action of enalapril maleate (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Heart Failure In trials in patients treated with digitalis and 
diuretics, treatment with enalapril resulted in decreased systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and heart size, and increased cardiac output and exercise 
tolerance. Heart rate was unchanged or slightly reduced, and mean ejection fraction was unchanged or increased. There was a beneficial effect on severity of heart failure as measured by the New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) classification and on symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue. Hemodynamic effects were observed after the first dose and appeared to be maintained in uncontrolled studies lasting as 
long as four months. Effects on exercise tolerance, heart size, and severity and symptoms of heart failure were observed in placebo-controlled studies lasting from eight weeks to over one year. 
ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: Heart Failure, Mortality Trials In a multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 2,569 patients with all degrees of symptomatic heart failure and ejection 
fraction ≤35 percent were randomized to placebo or enalapril and followed for up to 55 months (SOLVD-Treatment). Use of enalapril was associated with an 11 percent reduction in all-cause mortality and
a 30 percent reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. Diseases that excluded patients from enrollment in the study included severe stable angina (>2 attacks/day), hemodynamically significant 
valvular or outflow tract obstruction, renal failure (creatinine >2.5 mg/dL), cerebrovascular disease (e.g., significant carotid artery disease), advanced pulmonary disease, malignancies, active 
myocarditis and constrictive pericarditis. The mortality benefit associated with enalapril does not appear to depend upon digitalis being present.

        Question: Does ENALAPRIL MALEATE increase or decrease the risk of acute liver injury?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if ENALAPRIL MALEATE increases the risk of acute liver injury.
2. FDAHandler responded that ENALAPRIL MALEATE has been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, and sometimes death. The 
mechanism of this syndrome is not understood, but elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred, indicating potential liver injury. Patients who develop jaundice or marked 
elevations of hepatic enzymes while receiving ENALAPRIL MALEATE should discontinue the drug and receive appropriate medical follow-up.
        -----
        Final answer: ENALAPRIL MALEATE has been associated with an increased risk of a syndrome that can lead to acute liver injury, including cholestatic jaundice and fulminant hepatic necrosis. 
However, the occurrence of this syndrome is rare.
