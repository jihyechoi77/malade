                Passages:
                1. Drug HALOPERIDOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for HALOPERIDOL does not contain information about its effect on the risk of hip fracture. Therefore, I cannot determine whether HALOPERIDOL increases or decreases the risk of hip 
fracture based on FDA label data.
2. Drug THIOTHIXENE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for thiothixene does not contain information regarding its effects on the risk of hip fracture, as indicated by the response of DO-NOT-KNOW from FDAHandler. Therefore, it is not possible
to determine from the FDA label data whether thiothixene increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture.
3. Drug PIMOZIDE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question asked was whether Pimozide increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. I attempted to retrieve information from FDAHandler regarding the effect of Pimozide on the risk of hip 
fracture. However, multiple attempts to obtain information from FDAHandler were unsuccessful. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to determine if Pimozide has an 
effect on the risk of hip fracture. The FDA label for Pimozide does not specify any information regarding its impact on hip fracture risk, which is why the answer is DO-NOT-KNOW.

                Does the typical antipsychotic category of drugs increase the risk of
                hip fracture, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the typical antipsychotic category of drugs increase the risk of hip fracture, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA labels for the drugs HALOPERIDOL, THIOTHIXENE, and PIMOZIDE do not contain information about their effects on the risk of hip fracture.
2. Without specific information from the FDA labels, it is not possible to determine whether these typical antipsychotic drugs increase or decrease the risk of hip fracture.
3. Since there is no available evidence from the FDA labels for these drugs, we cannot generalize about the effect of the typical antipsychotic category on hip fracture risk.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the typical antipsychotic category of drugs on the risk of hip fracture based on the available FDA label data.
