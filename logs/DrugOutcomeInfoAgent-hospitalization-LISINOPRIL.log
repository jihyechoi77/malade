CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood 
pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a
wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as 
appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure 
goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Programâ€™s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, 
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of 
action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic 
property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in 
myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg 
is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: Relative risk reduction from blood 
pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, 
patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood 
pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). 
These considerations may guide selection of therapy. These fixed-dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: In using 
lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients 
with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk. (See WARNINGS .) In considering use of lisinopril and
hydrochlorothiazide tablets, it should be noted that Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-Black. (See WARNINGS, Head and 
Neck Angioedema .         
SOURCE:LISINOPRIL label


CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: pharmacodynamics: Pharmacodynamics Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent
with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients. (See WARNINGS .) In 
most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six 
hours. In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy. At recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for 
at least 24 hours, after dosing, although the effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect six hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during 
long-term therapy. LISINOPRIL: pharmacodynamics: Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood
pressure. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac 
output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several 
small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not 
large. In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (see PRECAUTIONS ).

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: general_precautions: General Lisinopril Aortic Stenosis/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: As with all vasodilators, lisinopril should be given with caution to patients with obstruction
in the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in 
susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with 
unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. LISINOPRIL: general_precautions: Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients renal function should be monitored during the first few 
weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially 
when lisinopril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of lisinopril and/or discontinuation of the 
diuretic may be required. Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . ) Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials hyperkalemia 
(serum potassium greater than 5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1. LISINOPRIL: general_precautions: 4 percent of hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. In most 
cases these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Hyperkalemia was not a cause of discontinuation of therapy. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal 
insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes. Hyperkalemia can cause serious, sometimes 
fatal, arrhythmias. Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be used cautiously, if at all, with these agents and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug 
Interactions .) Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after 
discontinuation of therapy. LISINOPRIL: general_precautions: ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing major 
surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, lisinopril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be 
due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion. Hydrochlorothiazide Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at 
appropriate intervals. All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. 
Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids.

Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving PRINZIDE, with an incidence higher in Black than in non-Black patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the
face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx occurs, treatment with PRINZIDE should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. In rare cases, intestinal angioedema has 
been reported with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors including lisinopril. (See WARNINGS ). Hypotension: In clinical trials, adverse effects relating to hypotension occurred as follows: 
hypotension (1.4 percent), orthostatic hypotension (0.5 percent), other orthostatic effects (3.2 percent). In addition syncope occurred in 0.8 percent of patients (See WARNINGS ). LISINOPRIL: 
adverse_reactions: Cough: See PRECAUTIONS - Cough . Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes: (See PRECAUTIONS ). Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor reversible increases in blood urea

likely to occur in patients with renal artery stenosis (See PRECAUTIONS ). Serum Uric Acid, Glucose, Magnesium, Cholesterol, Triglycerides and Calcium: (See PRECAUTIONS ). Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: 
Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.5 g% and 1.5 vol%, respectively) occurred frequently in hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril and 
hydrochlorothiazide tablets but were rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexisted. LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: In clinical trials, 0.4% of patients discontinued therapy

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations occur within about 7 hours. Declining serum concentrations
exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not
appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of 
lisinopril is approximately 25 percent, with large intersubject variability (6% to 60%) at all doses tested (5 mg to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the 
gastrointestinal tract. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours. LISINOPRIL: pharmacokinetics: Impaired renal function decreases elimination of 
lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular 
filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain 
steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients. (See DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION ) Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in 
accumulation in any tissues. However, milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14 C lisinopril. LISINOPRIL: pharmacokinetics: By whole body autoradiography, 
radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Lisinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide As a result of its diuretic effects, hydrochlorothiazide increases plasma renin activity, increases 
aldosterone secretion, and decreases serum potassium. Administration of lisinopril blocks the renin-angiotensin aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with the diuretic. 
In clinical studies, the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive. The lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 
10-12.5 combination worked equally well in Black and Caucasian patients. The lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20-12.5 and lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20-25 combinations 
appeared somewhat less effective in Black patients, but relatively few Black patients were studied. LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: In most patients, the antihypertensive effect of lisinopril and 
hydrochlorothiazide tablets was sustained for at least 24 hours. In a randomized, controlled comparison, the mean antihypertensive effects of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20-12.5 and 
lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20-25 were similar, suggesting that many patients who respond adequately to the latter combination may be controlled with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide 
tablets 20-12.5. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide has little or no effect on the bioavailability of either drug. The combination 
tablet is bioequivalent to concomitant administration of the separate entities. LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Lisinopril Mechanism of Action Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme 
(ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates 
aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. The 
latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium. Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. In hypertensive patients 
with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks, the mean increase in serum potassium was less than 0. LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: 1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15
percent of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately six percent had a decrease greater than 0.5 mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide 
diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS .) ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent 
vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily 
suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Although lisinopril was 
antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to lisinopril monotherapy than non-Black patients. 
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations occur within about 7 hours. Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase 
which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum 
proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25 percent,

gastrointestinal tract. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours. Impaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted 
principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular filtration rate, the elimination 
half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged. Older 
patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) Lisinopril can 
be removed by hemodialysis. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in

supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated

blood pressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction
in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase 
in mean renal blood flow that was not significant.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: warnings: The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal 
angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing 
desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors
were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure: Sudden and potentially life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions have been
reported in some patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for 
anaphylactoid reactions must be initiated. LISINOPRIL: warnings: Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a 
different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with 
dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension and Related Effects Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in uncomplicated hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of lisinopril use in 
salt/volume-depleted persons such as those treated vigorously with diuretics or patients on dialysis. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Syncope has been reported in 0.8 
percent of patients receiving lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. In patients with hypertension receiving lisinopril alone, the incidence of syncope was 0.1 percent. LISINOPRIL: warnings: The 
overall incidence of syncope may be reduced by proper titration of the individual components. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions , ADVERSE REACTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) In patients with 
severe congestive heart failure, with or without associated renal insufficiency, excessive hypotension has been observed and may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely 
with acute renal failure and/or death. Because of the potential fall in blood pressure in these patients, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. Such patients should be 
followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular 
disease in whom an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. LISINOPRIL: warnings: If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in 
supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses which usually can be given without 
difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume expansion. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis
and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen vascular disease. Available data from 
clinical trials of lisinopril are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Marketing experience has revealed rare cases of neutropenia and bone marrow 
depression in which a causal relationship to lisinopril cannot be excluded. LISINOPRIL: warnings: Periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in patients with collagen vascular disease and renal 
disease should be considered. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice or hepatitis and progresses to fulminant hepatic 
necrosis, and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the
ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate 
azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver 
disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

        Question: Does LISINOPRIL increase or decrease the risk of hospitalization?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether LISINOPRIL increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that Lisinopril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension and by lowering blood pressure, it lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily 
strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs, including lisinopril. Therefore, it can be concluded that lisinopril, by reducing 
blood pressure and associated cardiovascular risks, would likely decrease the risk of hospitalization due to these events.
        -----
        Final answer: Lisinopril is likely to decrease the risk of hospitalization by lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, such as strokes and 
myocardial infarctions.

Lisinopril is likely to decrease the risk of hospitalization by lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, such as strokes and myocardial infarctions. 
This conclusion is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which states that lisinopril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension and has been shown in controlled trials to lower the 
risk of cardiovascular events by managing blood pressure.
