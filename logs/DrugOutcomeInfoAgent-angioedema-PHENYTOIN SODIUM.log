CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure : May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done 
gradually. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions : Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this 
drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity : If signs or symptoms of 
hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is 
indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.7 ) 5. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous 
administration of Phenytoin Sodium Injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included 
bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in 
critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying 
cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a 
rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above 
the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly 
as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because
adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium 
Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly 
discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for 
dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, 
rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic 
Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of 
symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest 
SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and 
symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  . Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the 
presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN 
in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: In addition, retrospective, case-control, 
genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been 
associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers  .
The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: The 
role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of 
dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms 
(DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS 
typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological
abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Because this disorder is variable in its 
expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash
is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or 
symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity  . Additionally, consider 
alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. PHENYTOIN SODIUM:
warnings_and_cautions: Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to 
phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS 
or may occur in isolation . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin 
hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
warnings_and_cautions: 7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included 
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between 
phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect 
relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur
with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS .

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse 
developmental outcomes. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure 
Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are 
advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 
1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of 
abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to 
epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in 
children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal 
malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In 
the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of
major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy 
because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage
. However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening 
bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K 
administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an 
approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital 
hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control 
using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation
of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as “purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin 
injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms 
may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
warnings_and_cautions: Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge 
catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed 
by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause 
pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is
increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 
Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this 
disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks 
for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac 
defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and 
cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several 
reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns 
exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia 
Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic 
patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or 
"encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction 
of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion  
Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus  Serious Dermatologic Reactions  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity  Hypersensitivity  
Hepatic Injury  Hematopoietic Complications  Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome)  Exacerbation of Porphyria  Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn  Hyperglycemia  The following 
adverse reactions associated with the use of Phenytoin Sodium Injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population
of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the 
intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
adverse_reactions: The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients 
. Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS  have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. 
There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and 
fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Severe complications are most commonly encountered in
elderly or critically ill patients  . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure  , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. 
Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin  . These have included thrombocytopenia, 
leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to 
folic acid therapy.

increased or decreased risk of angioedema. However, it does warn about serious dermatologic reactions, including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan 
hypersensitivity, which can present with symptoms such as rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, along with other organ system involvement. These reactions can be severe and sometimes 
fatal, and if such signs or symptoms are present, immediate evaluation is recommended. PHENYTOIN SODIUM should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be

Given this information, while angioedema is not specifically mentioned, the warning about facial swelling as part of a hypersensitivity reaction suggests that there may be a potential risk for 
angioedema, as it is a form of swelling that can occur in similar hypersensitivity reactions. However, without explicit mention of angioedema in the label, we cannot definitively say that PHENYTOIN 
SODIUM increases the risk of angioedema based on the FDA label data alone.

Therefore, the degree of reliability of this answer is limited to the information provided in the FDA label, which does not confirm a direct association between PHENYTOIN SODIUM and angioedema.

        Question: Does PHENYTOIN SODIUM increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.
2. FDAHandler responded that the FDA label for PHENYTOIN SODIUM does not explicitly mention an increased or decreased risk of angioedema. However, it does warn about serious dermatologic reactions, 
including Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity, which can present with symptoms such as rash, fever, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling.
3. Based on the information provided, while angioedema is not specifically mentioned, the warning about facial swelling as part of a hypersensitivity reaction suggests that there may be a potential 
risk for angioedema, as it is a form of swelling that can occur in similar hypersensitivity reactions.
4. Without explicit mention of angioedema in the label, we cannot definitively say that PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases the risk of angioedema based on the FDA label data alone.
        -----
        Final answer: The FDA label for PHENYTOIN SODIUM does not explicitly state that it increases or decreases the risk of angioedema. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, we do not know if 
PHENYTOIN SODIUM has an effect on the risk of angioedema.

The FDA label for PHENYTOIN SODIUM does not explicitly state that it increases or decreases the risk of angioedema. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, we do not know if PHENYTOIN SODIUM has an 
effect on the risk of angioedema.
