Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: One patient treated with alendronate sodium (10 mg/day), who had a history of peptic ulcer disease and gastrectomy and who was taking concomitant aspirin developed 
an anastomotic ulcer with mild hemorrhage, which was considered drug related. Aspirin and alendronate sodium were discontinued and the patient recovered. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: In the Study 1
and Study 2 populations, 49-54% had a history of gastrointestinal disorders at baseline and 54-89% used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin at some time during the studies [ see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.1) ]. Laboratory Test Findings: In double-blind, multicenter, controlled studies, asymptomatic, mild, and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in 
approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of patients taking alendronate versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo. However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to less than 8.0 
mg/dL (2.0 mM) and serum phosphate to less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL (0.65 mM) were similar in both treatment groups. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: Weekly Dosing The safety of alendronate sodium 70
mg once weekly for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing alendronate 70 mg once weekly and alendronate 10 mg daily. The 
overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly alendronate 70 mg and alendronate 10 mg daily were similar. The adverse reactions considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or 
definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 2. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: Table 2 Osteoporosis Treatment Studies in

were increased in high-dose female mice (p=0.003) in a 92-week oral carcinogenicity study at doses of alendronate of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day (males) or 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg/day (females). These doses are 
equivalent to 0.12 to 1.2 times a maximum recommended daily dose of 40 mg, based on surface area, mg/m 2 . The relevance of this finding to humans is unknown. Parafollicular cell (thyroid) adenomas 
were increased in high-dose male rats (p=0. ALENDRONATE: nonclinical_toxicology: 003) in a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study at doses of 1 and 3.75 mg/kg body weight. These doses are equivalent to 
0.26 and 1 times a 40 mg human daily dose based on surface area, mg/m 2 . The relevance of this finding to humans is unknown. Alendronate sodium was not genotoxic in the in vitro microbial mutagenesis
assay with and without metabolic activation, in an in vitro mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, in an in vitro alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, and in an in vivo chromosomal aberration assay 
in mice. In an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, however, alendronate gave equivocal results. Alendronate sodium had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats
at oral doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (1. ALENDRONATE: nonclinical_toxicology: 3 times a 40 mg human daily dose based on surface area, mg/m 2 ). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology The relative

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows 
preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active 
resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [ 3 H]alendronate in 
bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [ 3 H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed 
that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not 
pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate 
treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in 
bone mass. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces 
bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. ALENDRONATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of
low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females 
but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and 
lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90, the risk of hip fracture in 
white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or 
more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. 
Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including 
decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return
toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term 
treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l 
collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies 
who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was 
maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: indications_and_usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BINOSTO is a bisphosphonate indicated for: Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women ( 1.1 ) Treatment to increase bone 
mass in men with osteoporosis ( 1.2 ) Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use
( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of 
osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .] 1. 
ALENDRONATE: indications_and_usage: 2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis BINOSTO is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis  . 1.3 Important 
Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All
patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 
to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no 
increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials  . 5.2 Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with BINOSTO . Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism
(such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with BINOSTO. 
Presumably due to the effects of BINOSTO on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur. Patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D 
intake. 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 3 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients
taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis  . This category of drugs includes BINOSTO. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms 
varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when
rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. In placebo-controlled clinical studies of alendronate sodium, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the alendronate
sodium and placebo groups. 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth 
extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include 
invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor 
oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of
exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Clinical 
judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while
on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy 
should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have 
been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or 
short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not
been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the 
affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with 
glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical 
fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral
limb.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: One patient treated with alendronate sodium (10 mg/day), who had a history of peptic ulcer disease and gastrectomy and who was taking concomitant aspirin developed 
an anastomotic ulcer with mild hemorrhage, which was considered drug related. Aspirin and alendronate sodium were discontinued and the patient recovered. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: In the Study 1
and Study 2 populations, 49-54% had a history of gastrointestinal disorders at baseline and 54-89% used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin at some time during the studies [ see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.1) ]. Laboratory Test Findings: In double-blind, multicenter, controlled studies, asymptomatic, mild, and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in 
approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of patients taking alendronate versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo. However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to less than 8.0 
mg/dL (2.0 mM) and serum phosphate to less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL (0.65 mM) were similar in both treatment groups. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: Weekly Dosing The safety of alendronate sodium 70
mg once weekly for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing alendronate 70 mg once weekly and alendronate 10 mg daily. The 
overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly alendronate 70 mg and alendronate 10 mg daily were similar. The adverse reactions considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or 
definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 2. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: Table 2 Osteoporosis Treatment Studies in

were increased in high-dose female mice (p=0.003) in a 92-week oral carcinogenicity study at doses of alendronate of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day (males) or 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg/day (females). These doses are 
equivalent to 0.12 to 1.2 times a maximum recommended daily dose of 40 mg, based on surface area, mg/m 2 . The relevance of this finding to humans is unknown. Parafollicular cell (thyroid) adenomas 
were increased in high-dose male rats (p=0. ALENDRONATE: nonclinical_toxicology: 003) in a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study at doses of 1 and 3.75 mg/kg body weight. These doses are equivalent to 
0.26 and 1 times a 40 mg human daily dose based on surface area, mg/m 2 . The relevance of this finding to humans is unknown. Alendronate sodium was not genotoxic in the in vitro microbial mutagenesis
assay with and without metabolic activation, in an in vitro mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, in an in vitro alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, and in an in vivo chromosomal aberration assay 
in mice. In an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, however, alendronate gave equivocal results. Alendronate sodium had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats
at oral doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (1. ALENDRONATE: nonclinical_toxicology: 3 times a 40 mg human daily dose based on surface area, mg/m 2 ). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology The relative

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows 
preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active 
resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [ 3 H]alendronate in 
bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [ 3 H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed 
that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not 
pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate 
treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in 
bone mass. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces 
bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. ALENDRONATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of
low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females 
but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and 
lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90, the risk of hip fracture in 
white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or 
more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. 
Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including 
decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return
toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term 
treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l 
collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies 
who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was 
maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: indications_and_usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BINOSTO is a bisphosphonate indicated for: Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women ( 1.1 ) Treatment to increase bone 
mass in men with osteoporosis ( 1.2 ) Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use
( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of 
osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .] 1. 
ALENDRONATE: indications_and_usage: 2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis BINOSTO is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis  . 1.3 Important 
Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All
patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 
to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no 
increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials  . 5.2 Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with BINOSTO . Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism
(such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with BINOSTO. 
Presumably due to the effects of BINOSTO on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur. Patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D 
intake. 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 3 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients
taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis  . This category of drugs includes BINOSTO. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms 
varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when
rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. In placebo-controlled clinical studies of alendronate sodium, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the alendronate
sodium and placebo groups. 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth 
extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include 
invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor 
oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of
exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Clinical 
judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while
on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy 
should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have 
been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or 
short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not
been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the 
affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with 
glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical 
fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral
limb.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: One patient treated with alendronate sodium (10 mg/day), who had a history of peptic ulcer disease and gastrectomy and who was taking concomitant aspirin developed 
an anastomotic ulcer with mild hemorrhage, which was considered drug related. Aspirin and alendronate sodium were discontinued and the patient recovered. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: In the Study 1
and Study 2 populations, 49-54% had a history of gastrointestinal disorders at baseline and 54-89% used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin at some time during the studies [ see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.1) ]. Laboratory Test Findings: In double-blind, multicenter, controlled studies, asymptomatic, mild, and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in 
approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of patients taking alendronate versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo. However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to less than 8.0 
mg/dL (2.0 mM) and serum phosphate to less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL (0.65 mM) were similar in both treatment groups. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: Weekly Dosing The safety of alendronate sodium 70
mg once weekly for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing alendronate 70 mg once weekly and alendronate 10 mg daily. The 
overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly alendronate 70 mg and alendronate 10 mg daily were similar. The adverse reactions considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or 
definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 2. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: Table 2 Osteoporosis Treatment Studies in

were increased in high-dose female mice (p=0.003) in a 92-week oral carcinogenicity study at doses of alendronate of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day (males) or 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg/day (females). These doses are 
equivalent to 0.12 to 1.2 times a maximum recommended daily dose of 40 mg, based on surface area, mg/m 2 . The relevance of this finding to humans is unknown. Parafollicular cell (thyroid) adenomas 
were increased in high-dose male rats (p=0. ALENDRONATE: nonclinical_toxicology: 003) in a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study at doses of 1 and 3.75 mg/kg body weight. These doses are equivalent to 
0.26 and 1 times a 40 mg human daily dose based on surface area, mg/m 2 . The relevance of this finding to humans is unknown. Alendronate sodium was not genotoxic in the in vitro microbial mutagenesis
assay with and without metabolic activation, in an in vitro mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, in an in vitro alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, and in an in vivo chromosomal aberration assay 
in mice. In an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, however, alendronate gave equivocal results. Alendronate sodium had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats
at oral doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (1. ALENDRONATE: nonclinical_toxicology: 3 times a 40 mg human daily dose based on surface area, mg/m 2 ). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology The relative

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows 
preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active 
resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [ 3 H]alendronate in 
bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [ 3 H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed 
that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not 
pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate 
treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in 
bone mass. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces 
bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. ALENDRONATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of
low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females 
but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and 
lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90, the risk of hip fracture in 
white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or 
more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. 
Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including 
decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return
toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term 
treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l 
collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies 
who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was 
maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: indications_and_usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BINOSTO is a bisphosphonate indicated for: Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women ( 1.1 ) Treatment to increase bone 
mass in men with osteoporosis ( 1.2 ) Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use
( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of 
osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .] 1. 
ALENDRONATE: indications_and_usage: 2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis BINOSTO is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis  . 1.3 Important 
Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All
patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 
to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no 
increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials  . 5.2 Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with BINOSTO . Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism
(such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with BINOSTO. 
Presumably due to the effects of BINOSTO on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur. Patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D 
intake. 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 3 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients
taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis  . This category of drugs includes BINOSTO. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms 
varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when
rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. In placebo-controlled clinical studies of alendronate sodium, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the alendronate
sodium and placebo groups. 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth 
extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include 
invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor 
oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of
exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Clinical 
judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while
on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy 
should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have 
been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or 
short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not
been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the 
affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with 
glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical 
fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral
limb.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions: One patient treated with alendronate sodium (10 mg/day), who had a history of peptic ulcer disease and gastrectomy and who was taking concomitant aspirin developed 
an anastomotic ulcer with mild hemorrhage, which was considered drug related. Aspirin and alendronate sodium were discontinued and the patient recovered. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: In the Study 1
and Study 2 populations, 49-54% had a history of gastrointestinal disorders at baseline and 54-89% used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin at some time during the studies [ see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.1) ]. Laboratory Test Findings: In double-blind, multicenter, controlled studies, asymptomatic, mild, and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in 
approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of patients taking alendronate versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking placebo. However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to less than 8.0 
mg/dL (2.0 mM) and serum phosphate to less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL (0.65 mM) were similar in both treatment groups. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: Weekly Dosing The safety of alendronate sodium 70
mg once weekly for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study comparing alendronate 70 mg once weekly and alendronate 10 mg daily. The 
overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly alendronate 70 mg and alendronate 10 mg daily were similar. The adverse reactions considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or 
definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients in either treatment group are presented in Table 2. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: Table 2 Osteoporosis Treatment Studies in

were increased in high-dose female mice (p=0.003) in a 92-week oral carcinogenicity study at doses of alendronate of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day (males) or 1, 2, and 5 mg/kg/day (females). These doses are 
equivalent to 0.12 to 1.2 times a maximum recommended daily dose of 40 mg, based on surface area, mg/m 2 . The relevance of this finding to humans is unknown. Parafollicular cell (thyroid) adenomas 
were increased in high-dose male rats (p=0. ALENDRONATE: nonclinical_toxicology: 003) in a 2-year oral carcinogenicity study at doses of 1 and 3.75 mg/kg body weight. These doses are equivalent to 
0.26 and 1 times a 40 mg human daily dose based on surface area, mg/m 2 . The relevance of this finding to humans is unknown. Alendronate sodium was not genotoxic in the in vitro microbial mutagenesis
assay with and without metabolic activation, in an in vitro mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, in an in vitro alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, and in an in vivo chromosomal aberration assay 
in mice. In an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, however, alendronate gave equivocal results. Alendronate sodium had no effect on fertility (male or female) in rats
at oral doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (1. ALENDRONATE: nonclinical_toxicology: 3 times a 40 mg human daily dose based on surface area, mg/m 2 ). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology The relative

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows 
preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active 
resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [ 3 H]alendronate in 
bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [ 3 H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed 
that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not 
pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate 
treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in 
bone mass. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces 
bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. ALENDRONATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of
low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females 
but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and 
lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90, the risk of hip fracture in 
white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or 
more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. 
Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including 
decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return
toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term 
treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l 
collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies 
who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was 
maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: indications_and_usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BINOSTO is a bisphosphonate indicated for: Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women ( 1.1 ) Treatment to increase bone 
mass in men with osteoporosis ( 1.2 ) Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use
( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of 
osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .] 1. 
ALENDRONATE: indications_and_usage: 2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis BINOSTO is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis  . 1.3 Important 
Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All
patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 
to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.         
SOURCE:ALENDRONATE label


CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no 
increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials  . 5.2 Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with BINOSTO . Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism
(such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with BINOSTO. 
Presumably due to the effects of BINOSTO on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur. Patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D 
intake. 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 3 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients
taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis  . This category of drugs includes BINOSTO. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms 
varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when
rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. In placebo-controlled clinical studies of alendronate sodium, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the alendronate
sodium and placebo groups. 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth 
extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing, and has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium. Known risk factors for osteonecrosis of the jaw include 
invasive dental procedures (e.g., tooth extraction, dental implants, boney surgery), diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor 
oral hygiene, and co-morbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other pre-existing dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). The risk of ONJ may increase with duration of
exposure to bisphosphonates. For patients requiring invasive dental procedures, discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment may reduce the risk for ONJ. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Clinical 
judgment of the treating physician and/or oral surgeon should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/risk assessment. Patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while
on bisphosphonate therapy should receive care by an oral surgeon. In these patients, extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition. Discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy 
should be considered based on individual benefit/risk assessment. 5.5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fractures Atypical, low-energy, or low trauma fractures of the femoral shaft have 
been reported in bisphosphonate-treated patients. These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or 
short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Causality has not been established as these fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients who have not
been treated with bisphosphonates. Atypical femur fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area. They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the 
affected area, usually presenting as dull, aching thigh pain, weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs. A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with 
glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone) at the time of fracture. Any patient with a history of bisphosphonate exposure who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical 
fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patients presenting with an atypical fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral
limb.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

The FDA label for ALENDRONATE does not contain information regarding an increased risk of aplastic anemia, hence there is no known association between ALENDRONATE and aplastic anemia based on the FDA 
label data.
