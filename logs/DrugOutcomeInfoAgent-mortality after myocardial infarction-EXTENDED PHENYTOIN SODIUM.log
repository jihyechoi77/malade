CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy
Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal 
hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been
reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, 
including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and 
other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy:
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an 
approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital 
hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema
such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) 
Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus 
Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage 
reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more 
rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and 
Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for
any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
warnings_and_cautions: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing 
an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with 
AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 
24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The 
finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary 
substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 
Table 1: Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: 
Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 
1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but 
the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy
Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal 
hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been
reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, 
including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and 
other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy:
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an 
approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital 
hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema
such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) 
Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus 
Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage 
reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more 
rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and 
Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for
any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
warnings_and_cautions: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing 
an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with 
AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 
24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The 
finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary 
substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions:

valproate sodium c , valproic acid c a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John’s wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic 
acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by 
phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy 
with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting
Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide 
Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance . Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, 
pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered 
phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Prevention or Management: Patients should be 
monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Warfarin Increased and 
decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is co-administered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine,

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema
such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) 
Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus 
Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage 
reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more 
rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and 
Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for
any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
warnings_and_cautions: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing 
an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy
Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal 
hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been
reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, 
including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and 
other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy:
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an 
approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital 
hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema
such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) 
Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus 
Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage 
reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more 
rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and 
Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for
any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
warnings_and_cautions: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing 
an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with 
AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 
24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The 
finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary 
substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 
Table 1: Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: 
Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 
1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but 
the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy
Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal 
hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been
reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, 
including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and 
other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy:
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an 
approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital 
hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.
