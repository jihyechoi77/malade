                1. Drug ALENDRONATE SODIUM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ALENDRONATE SODIUM does not contain information regarding its effect on mortality risk after myocardial infarction. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this data whether 
ALENDRONATE SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
2. Drug ALENDRONATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data does not specify whether alendronate increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Therefore, we cannot determine the effect of alendronate on mortality 
post-myocardial infarction based on the available FDA label information.
                ---------
                Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of
                mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Both passages indicate that the FDA label for alendronate and alendronate sodium does not contain information regarding their effect on mortality risk after myocardial infarction.
2. Since the FDA label is a reliable source of drug information and it does not specify any effect, we do not have evidence to suggest that alendronate drugs increase or decrease the risk of mortality
after myocardial infarction.
3. In the absence of specific information or evidence, we cannot make a definitive claim about the effect of alendronate drugs on mortality post-myocardial infarction.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the alendronate category of drugs on the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction based on the information provided.
