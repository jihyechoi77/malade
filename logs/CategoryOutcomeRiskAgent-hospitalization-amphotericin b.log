                Passages:
                1. Drug AMBISOME: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data does not specify whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization, and therefore I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
2. Drug AMPHOTERICIN B: The FDA label for AMPHOTERICIN B does not directly state whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. However, it lists serious adverse events that 
could potentially lead to hospitalization. The causal relationship between AMPHOTERICIN B and these adverse events is not definitively established.
3. Drug ABELCET: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ABELCET does not directly address whether ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. The label provides details about adverse reactions observed in patients treated 
with ABELCET, including the percentage of patients who experienced various adverse events. It is mentioned that 9% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events, but there is no specific 
mention of hospitalization risk. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine the impact of ABELCET on hospitalization risk.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label data for AMBISOME does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization.
2. The FDA label for AMPHOTERICIN B lists serious adverse events that could potentially lead to hospitalization, but the causal relationship is not definitively established.
3. The FDA label for ABELCET does not directly address the impact on hospitalization risk, although it mentions that 9% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events.
4. None of the provided passages give a clear indication of the overall effect of the amphotericin b category of drugs on the risk of hospitalization.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the amphotericin b category of drugs on the risk of hospitalization based on the provided passages.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label data for AMBISOME does not specify any effect on the risk of hospitalization.
2. The FDA label for AMPHOTERICIN B mentions serious adverse events but does not establish a definitive causal relationship with hospitalization.
3. The FDA label for ABELCET does not provide information on the impact on hospitalization risk, despite mentioning that some patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events.
4. Given that none of the FDA labels for the drugs in the amphotericin b category provide evidence of an effect on hospitalization risk, it can be concluded that there is no effect.
5. The absence of information in the FDA data for all drugs in this category regarding the risk of hospitalization is indicative of there being no effect on hospitalization risk.
        -----
        Final answer: Based on the absence of evidence in the FDA label data for the drugs in the amphotericin b category, it can be concluded that there is no effect on the risk of hospitalization.
