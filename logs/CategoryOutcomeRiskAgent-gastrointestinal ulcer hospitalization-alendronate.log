                Passages:
                1. Drug ALENDRONATE SODIUM: ALENDRONATE SODIUM has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects that can be severe and may lead to hospitalization, such as esophageal ulcers 
and erosions. However, it is important to note that while there have been post-marketing reports of severe gastric and duodenal ulcers with complications, no increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcer 
hospitalization was observed in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, while there is a potential risk, the degree of reliability of this association is not fully established, and the risk of 
hospitalization due to gastrointestinal ulcers appears to be rare.
2. Drug ALENDRONATE: Alendronate may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, as it has been associated with severe esophageal adverse experiences and post-marketing reports of 
gastric and duodenal ulcers that required hospitalization in some cases. However, it is important to note that no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials, indicating that while there
is a potential risk, it may not be common.

                Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of
                gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Both passages mention that alendronate and alendronate sodium have been associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects, including severe gastric and duodenal ulcers.
2. Both passages also note that these associations come from post-marketing reports, which are less controlled than clinical trials.
3. Passage 1 states that no increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization was observed in controlled clinical trials for alendronate sodium.
4. Passage 2 similarly notes that for alendronate, no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials.
5. Both passages conclude that while there is a potential risk, the risk of hospitalization due to gastrointestinal ulcers appears to be rare and may not be common.
6. The evidence suggests that while there are reports of severe cases, the controlled clinical trials did not show an increased risk, indicating that the effect is not consistent or well-established.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the alendronate category of drugs on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
