                1. Drug CARBAMAZEPINE: CARBAMAZEPINE increases the risk of angioedema, although such cases are rare. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which states that 
CARBAMAZEPINE has been reported to cause rare cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema, including potentially fatal laryngeal edema. Patients who develop such reactions should discontinue the drug and not 
be rechallenged with it.

                Does the carbamazepine category of drugs increase the risk of
                angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the carbamazepine category of drugs increase the risk of angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passage provides information from FDAHandler indicating that CARBAMAZEPINE has been reported to cause rare cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema.
2. It is mentioned that these cases include potentially fatal laryngeal edema.
3. Patients who develop such reactions are advised to discontinue the drug and not be rechallenged with it, suggesting a causal relationship between CARBAMAZEPINE and angioedema.
4. Although the cases are rare, the evidence points to an increased risk of angioedema with the use of CARBAMAZEPINE.
        -----
        Final answer: The carbamazepine category of drugs increases the risk of angioedema.
