        Question: Which three drugs from the provided list are the most common representatives of the tetracycline category?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. From the provided list, identify all drugs that belong to the tetracycline category.
2. Cross-reference the identified tetracycline drugs with the usage rates provided by the medical database query.
3. Select the three drugs with the highest usage rates, ensuring they are different active ingredients and not derivatives of the same drug.
4. The three drugs with the highest usage rates from the tetracycline category are 'Doxycycline Hyclate', 'Tigecycline', and 'Minocycline'.
5. Note that 'Doxycycline Hyclate' and 'doxycycline hyclate' are the same drug with different capitalizations, so their usage rates should be combined.
6. Similarly, 'Minocycline' and 'Minocycline 100mg tablets' are the same active ingredient, so their usage rates should be combined.
7. The usage rates for 'Demeclocycline' and 'demeclocycline' should also be combined as they are the same drug with different capitalizations.
        -----
        Final answer: 'Doxycycline Hyclate', 'Tigecycline', and 'Minocycline'
