CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: boxed_warning: WARNING Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs 
are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in 
drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was 
about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death)
or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. THIOTHIXENE: boxed_warning: Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may 
increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is
not clear. Thiothixene is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see WARNINGS ).

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: warnings: WARNINGS Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are 
at an increased risk of death. Thiothixene is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see BOXED WARNING ). Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome 
consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene 1 . Although the prevalence of the syndrome 
appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely
to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the 
likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, 
the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the 
syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the 
syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, 
antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be 
reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are
not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The 
need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, 
some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome. (For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to “ Information
for Patients ” in the PRECAUTIONS section, and to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section.

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS NOTE : Not all of the following adverse reactions have been reported with thiothixene. However, since thiothixene has certain chemical and 
pharmacologic similarities to the phenothiazines, all of the known side effects and toxicity associated with phenothiazine therapy should be borne in mind when thiothixene is used. Cardiovascular 
Effects Tachycardia, hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope. In the event hypotension occurs, epinephrine should not be used as a pressor agent since a paradoxical further lowering of blood 
pressure may result. Nonspecific EKG changes have been observed in some patients receiving thiothixene. These changes are usually reversible and frequently disappear on continued thiothixene therapy. 
The incidence of these changes is lower than that observed with some phenothiazines. The clinical significance of these changes is not known. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: CNS Effects Drowsiness, 
usually mild, may occur although it usually subsides with continuation of thiothixene therapy. The incidence of sedation appears similar to that of the piperazine group of phenothiazines but less than
that of certain aliphatic phenothiazines. Restlessness, agitation and insomnia have been noted with thiothixene. Seizures and paradoxical exacerbation of psychotic symptoms have occurred with 
thiothixene infrequently. Hyperreflexia has been reported in infants delivered from mothers having received structurally related drugs. In addition, phenothiazine derivatives have been associated with
cerebral edema and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities. Extrapyramidal Symptoms Extrapyramidal symptoms, such as pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia have been reported (see Dystonia, Class effect
). Management of these extra-pyramidal symptoms depends upon the type and severity. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Rapid relief of acute symptoms may require the use of an injectable antiparkinson 
agent. More slowly emerging symptoms may be managed by reducing the dosage of thiothixene and/or administering an oral antiparkinson agent. Dystonia Class effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged 
abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to 
tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity
with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups.

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have
been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced 
leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the 
first few months of therapy and discontinuation of thiothixene should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients 
with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: 
Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue thiothixene and have their WBC followed until recovery. Information for Patients Given the likelihood that 
some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about 
this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided. 
Drug Interactions Hepatic microsomal enzyme inducing agents, such as carbamazepine, were found to significantly increase the clearance of thiothixene. Patients receiving these drugs should be observed
for signs of reduced thiothixene effectiveness 4,5 . THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Due to a possible additive effect with hypotensive agents, patients receiving these drugs should be observed closely for 
signs of excessive hypotension when thiothixene is added to their drug regimen 6 .

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage of thiothixene capsules should be individually adjusted depending on the chronicity and severity of the symptoms of 
schizophrenia. In general, small doses should be used initially and gradually increased to the optimal effective level, based on patient response. Some patients have been successfully maintained on 
once-a-day thiothixene capsules therapy. The use of thiothixene capsules in children under 12 years of age is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established. In milder 
conditions, an initial dose of 2 mg three times daily is recommended. If indicated, a subsequent increase to 15 mg/day total daily dose is often effective. In more severe conditions, an initial dose 
of 5 mg twice daily is recommended. The usual optimal dose is 20 mg to 30 mg daily. If indicated, an increase to 60 mg/day total daily dose is often effective. THIOTHIXENE: dosage_and_administration: 
Exceeding a total daily dose of 60 mg rarely increases the beneficial response.
