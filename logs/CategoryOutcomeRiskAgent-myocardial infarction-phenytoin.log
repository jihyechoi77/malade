                Passages:
                1. Drug PHENYTOIN SODIUM: The label for PHENYTOIN SODIUM does not mention a direct effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. However, it does note severe cardiovascular risks 
associated with rapid intravenous administration, which could indirectly increase the risk of myocardial infarction, especially in certain high-risk populations.
2. Drug PHENYTOIN: The FDA label for PHENYTOIN does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of myocardial infarction. However, it does indicate that rapid intravenous 
administration of the drug can lead to severe cardiovascular reactions, which could potentially include myocardial infarction as a consequence of those reactions. The degree of risk for myocardial 
infarction specifically is not detailed in the label.
3. Drug EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDAHandler has indicated that the available information from the EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of myocardial infarction as a 
result of using the drug. The label does note that EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can cause heart problems, including a slow heartbeat, and lists symptoms that could indicate heart issues, but it does not 
explicitly link the drug to myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, it is not possible to determine whether EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of 
myocardial infarction.

                Does the phenytoin category of drugs increase the risk of
                myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the phenytoin category of drugs increase the risk of myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that PHENYTOIN SODIUM does not have a direct effect on the risk of myocardial infarction according to its label, but rapid intravenous administration could indirectly 
increase the risk, especially in high-risk populations.
2. Passage 2 states that the FDA label for PHENYTOIN does not mention an increase or decrease in the risk of myocardial infarction, but severe cardiovascular reactions from rapid intravenous 
administration could potentially include myocardial infarction.
3. Passage 3 explains that the label for EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM does not specify an increase or decrease in the risk of myocardial infarction, although it can cause other heart problems.
4. None of the passages provide strong evidence of a direct effect of phenytoin drugs on the risk of myocardial infarction.
5. The potential for increased risk is only mentioned in the context of rapid intravenous administration, which is an indirect and not a drug-specific effect.
6. There is no consistent evidence across the category to suggest a clear effect on myocardial infarction risk.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the phenytoin category of drugs on the risk of myocardial infarction.
