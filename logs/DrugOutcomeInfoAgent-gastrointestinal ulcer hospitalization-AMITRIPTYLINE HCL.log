CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: boxed_warning: Boxed Warning SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS: Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in
children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets or 
any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with 
antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other 
psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed 
closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: boxed_warning: Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and 
communication with the prescriber. Amitriptyline hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: boxed_warning: (See WARNINGS: CLINICAL WORSENING AND SUICIDE RISK,

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: adverse_reactions: 7. Adverse Reactions Within each category the following adverse reactions are listed in order of decreasing severity. Included in the listing are a few 
adverse reactions which have not been reported with this specific drug. However, pharmacological similarities among the tricyclic antidepressant drugs require that each of the reactions be considered 
when amitriptyline is administered. Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction; stroke; nonspecific ECG changes and changes in AV conduction; heart block; arrhythmias; hypotension, particularly orthostatic
hypotension; syncope; hypertension; tachycardia; palpitation. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: adverse_reactions: CNS and Neuromuscular: Coma; seizures; hallucinations; delusions; confusional states; 
disorientation; incoordination; ataxia; tremors; peripheral neuropathy; numbness, tingling and paresthesias of the extremities; extrapyramidal symptoms including abnormal involuntary movements and 
tardive dyskinesia; dysarthria; disturbed concentration; excitement; anxiety; insomnia; restlessness; nightmares; drowsiness; dizziness; weakness; fatigue; headache; syndrome of inappropriate ADH 
(antidiuretic hormone) secretion; tinnitus; alteration in EEG patterns. Anticholinergic: Paralytic ileus, hyperpyrexia; urinary retention, dilatation of the urinary tract; constipation; blurred 
vision, disturbance of accommodation, increased ocular pressure, mydriasis; dry mouth. Allergic: Skin rash; urticaria; photosensitization; edema of face and tongue. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: 
adverse_reactions: Hematologic: Bone marrow depression including agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; purpura; eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal: Rarely hepatitis (including altered liver 
function and jaundice); nausea; epigastric distress; vomiting; anorexia; stomatitis; peculiar taste; diarrhea; parotid swelling; black tongue. Endocrine: Testicular swelling and gynecomastia in the 
male; breast enlargement and galactorrhea in the female; increased or decreased libido; impotence; elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels. Other: Alopecia; edema; weight gain or loss; urinary 
frequency; increased perspiration. Withdrawal Symptoms After prolonged administration, abrupt cessation of treatment may produce nausea, headache, and malaise. Gradual dosage reduction has been 
reported to produce, within two weeks, transient symptoms including irritability, restlessness, and dream and sleep disturbance. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: adverse_reactions: These symptoms are not indicative
of addiction. Rare instances have been reported of mania or hypomania occurring within 2 to 7 days following cessation of chronic therapy with tricyclic antidepressants. Causal Relationship Unknown 
Other reactions, reported under circumstances where a causal relationship could not be established, are listed to serve as alerting information to physicians: Body as a Whole: Lupus-like syndrome 
(migratory arthritis, positive ANA and rheumatoid factor). Digestive: Hepatic failure, ageusia. Postmarketing Adverse Events A syndrome resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been very 
rarely reported after starting or increasing the dose of amitriptyline hydrochloride, with and without concomitant medications known to cause NMS. Symptoms have included muscle rigidity, fever, mental
status changes, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and tremor. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: adverse_reactions: Very rare cases of serotonin syndrome (SS) have been reported with amitriptyline hydrochloride in 
combination with other drugs that have a recognized association with SS.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: 5. Warnings Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their 
depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist 
until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has 
been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of 
treatment. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal 
thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an 
increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The 
pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 
antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 
short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an 
increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk 
differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 
patients treated) are provided in Table 1. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to 
Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case ≥65 6 fewer case No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were 
suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., 
beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of 
depression. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, 
and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, 
agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients
being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms 
and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. 
AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or 
who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the
patient’s presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be
alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, 
and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for amitriptyline hydrochloride should be 
written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A 
major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an 
antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a 
conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar 
disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that amitriptyline hydrochloride is 
not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Amitriptyline hydrochloride may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or similarly acting compounds. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: It 
should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures and, because of its atropine-like action, in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma or increased 
intraocular pressure. In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, even average doses may precipitate an attack. Patients with cardiovascular disorders should be watched closely. Tricyclic antidepressant 
drugs, including amitriptyline hydrochloride, particularly when given in high doses, have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, and prolongation of the conduction time. Myocardial 
infarction and stroke have been reported with drugs of this class. Close supervision is required when amitriptyline hydrochloride is given to hyperthyroid patients or those receiving thyroid 
medication. Amitriptyline may enhance the response to alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it 
should be borne in mind that the potentiation may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage. Delirium has been reported with concurrent administration of amitriptyline and 
disulfiram. Usage in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Teratogenic effects were not observed in mice, rats, or rabbits when amitriptyline was given orally at doses of 2 to 40 mg/kg/day (up to 13 times 
the maximum recommended human dose 1). Studies in literature have shown amitriptyline to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given by various routes of administration at doses of 28 to 100 
mg/kg/day (9 to 33 times the maximum recommended human dose), producing multiple malformations. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Another study in the rat reported that an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day (8 
times the maximum recommended human dose) produced delays in ossification of fetal vertebral bodies without other signs of embryotoxicity. In rabbits, an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (20 times the 
maximum recommended human dose) was reported to cause incomplete ossification of cranial bones. Amitriptyline has been shown to cross the placenta. Although a causal relationship has not been 
established, there have been a few reports of adverse events, including CNS effects, limb deformities, or developmental delay, in infants whose mothers had taken amitriptyline during pregnancy. There 
are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Amitriptyline hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to 
the fetus. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Based on a maximum recommended amitriptyline dose of 150 mg/day or 3 mg/kg/day for a 50 kg patient. Nursing Mothers Amitriptyline is excreted into breast milk. 
In one report in which a patient received amitriptyline 100 mg/day while nursing her infant, levels of 83 to 141 ng/mL were detected in the mother’s serum. Levels of 135 to 151 ng/mL were found in the
breast milk, but no trace of the drug could be detected in the infant’s serum. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from amitriptyline, a decision should be made 
whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Usage in Pediatric Patients In view of the lack of experience with the use of 
this drug in pediatric patients, it is not recommended at the present time for patients under 12 years of age.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: 6. Precautions Schizophrenic patients may develop increased symptoms of psychosis; patients with paranoid symptomatology may have an exaggeration of such 
symptoms. Depressed patients, particularly those with known manic-depressive illness, may experience a shift to mania or hypomania. In these circumstances the dose of amitriptyline may be reduced or a
major tranquilizer such as perphenazine may be administered concurrently. The possibility of suicide in depressed patients remains until significant remission occurs. Potentially suicidal patients 
should not have access to large quantities of this drug. Prescriptions should be written for the smallest amount feasible. Concurrent administration of amitriptyline hydrochloride and electroshock 
therapy may increase the hazards associated with such therapy. Such treatment should be limited to patients for whom it is essential. When possible, the drug should be discontinued several days before
elective surgery. Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Amitriptyline hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with 
impaired liver function. Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with 
treatment with amitriptyline hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illnesses, 
and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions” is available for amitriptyline hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the 
Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions 
they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert
their prescriber if these occur while taking amitriptyline hydrochloride. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the 
emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in 
behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be 
advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient’s prescriber or health professional, especially 
if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal
thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. While on therapy with amitriptyline hydrochloride, patients should be advised as to the 
possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Drug Interactions Topiramate Some patients 
may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate and any adjustments in amitriptyline dose should be made according to the patient's clinical response and 
not on the basis of plasma levels. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase)
is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population (about 7 to 10% of Caucasians are so called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among 
Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on 
the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA). In addition, certain drugs inhibit the 
activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when 
given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are 
substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., 
fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of 
inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching
from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent 
and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary). Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed 
for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. 
It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors – see CONTRAINDICATIONS 
section. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Guanethidine or similarly acting compounds; thyroid medication; alcohol, barbiturates and other CNS depressants; and disulfiram – see WARNINGS section. When 
amitriptyline is given with anticholinergic agents or sympathomimetic drugs, including epinephrine combined with local anesthetics, close supervision and careful adjustment of dosages are required. 
Hyperpyrexia has been reported when amitriptyline is administered with anticholinergic agents or with neuroleptic drugs, particularly during hot weather. Paralytic ileus may occur in patients taking 
tricyclic antidepressants in combination with anticholinergic-type drugs. Cimetidine is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain tricyclic antidepressants, thereby delaying elimination and 
increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs. Clinically significant effects have been reported with the tricyclic antidepressants when used concomitantly with cimetidine. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: 
precautions: Increases in plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when cimetidine was added to 
the drug regimen. Discontinuation of cimetidine in well-controlled patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants and cimetidine may decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the antidepressants. 
Caution is advised if patients receive large doses of ethchlorvynol concurrently. Transient delirium has been reported in patients who were treated with one gram of ethchlorvynol and 75 to 150 mg of 
amitriptyline hydrochloride. Geriatric Use Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient 
should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic function, concomitant disease and other drug therapy in elderly patients.
AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Geriatric patients are particularly sensitive to the anticholinergic side effects of tricyclic antidepressants including amitriptyline hydrochloride. Peripheral 
anticholinergic effects include tachycardia, urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, and exacerbation of narrow-angle glaucoma. Central nervous system anticholinergic effects 
include cognitive impairment, psychomotor slowing, confusion, sedation, and delirium. Elderly patients taking amitriptyline hydrochloride may be at increased risk for falls. Elderly patients should be
started on low doses of amitriptyline hydrochloride and observed closely (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established 
(see BOX WARNING and WARNINGS: CLINICAL WORSENING AND SUICIDE RISK). AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Anyone considering the use of amitriptyline in a child or adolescent must balance the potential 
risks with the clinical need.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: 8. Overdosage Deaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate tricyclic 
antidepressant overdose. As the management is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment. Signs and symptoms of 
toxicity develop rapidly after tricyclic antidepressant overdose, therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible. Manifestations Critical manifestations of overdose include: cardiac 
dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, convulsions, and CNS depression, including coma. Changes in the electrocardiogram particularly in QRS axis or width, are clinically significant indicators of 
tricyclic antidepressant toxicity. In addition, a rightward axis shift in the terminal QRS complex together with a prolonged QT interval and sinus tachycardia are specific and sensitive indicators of 
first generation tricyclic overdose. The absence of these findings is not exclusionary. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: Prolonged PR interval, ST-T wave changes, ventricular tachycardia and 
fibrillation may also occur. Other signs of overdose may include: impaired myocardial contractility, confusion, disturbed concentration, transient visual hallucinations, dilated pupils, disorders of 
ocular motility, agitation, hyperactive reflexes polyradiculoneuropathy, stupor, drowsiness, muscle rigidity, vomiting, hypothermia, hyperpyrexia, or any of the symptoms listed under ADVERSE 
REACTIONS. Management General Obtain an ECG and immediately initiate cardiac monitoring. Protect the patient’s airway, establish an intravenous line and initiate gastric decontamination. A minimum of 
six hours of observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or respiratory depression, hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias and/or conduction blocks, and seizures is necessary. If 
signs of toxicity occur at any time during the period extended monitoring is required. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: There are case reports of patients succumbing to fatal dysrhythmias late after 
overdose; these patients had clinical evidence of significant poisoning prior to death and most received inadequate gastrointestinal decontamination. Monitoring of plasma drug levels should not guide 
management of the patient. Gastrointestinal Decontamination All patients suspected of tricyclic antidepressant overdose should receive gastrointestinal decontamination. This should include, large 
volume gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal. If consciousness is impaired, the airway should be secured prior to lavage. EMESIS IS CONTRAINDICATED. Cardiovascular A maximal limb-lead QRS 
duration of ≥0.10 seconds may be the best indication of the severity of the overdose. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be used to maintain the serum pH in the range of 7.45 to 7.55. If the pH 
response is inadequate, hyperventilation may also be used. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: Concomitant use of hyperventilation and sodium bicarbonate should be done with extreme caution, with frequent 
pH monitoring. A pH >7.60 or a pCO 2 <20 mm Hg is undesirable. Dysrhythmias unresponsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy/hyperventilation may respond to lidocaine, bretylium or phenytoin. Type 1 A and 1
C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide). In rare instances, hemoperfusion may be beneficial in acute refractory cardiovascular instability in 
patients with acute toxicity. However, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced diuresis generally have been reported as ineffective in tricyclic antidepressant poisoning. 
CNS In patients with CNS depression early intubation is advised because of the potential for abrupt deterioration. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: Seizures should be controlled with benzodiazepines, or
if these are ineffective, other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin). Physostigmine is not recommended except to treat life-threatening symptoms that have been unresponsive to other 
therapies, and then only in consultation with a poison control center. Psychiatric Follow-up Since overdosage is often deliberate, patients may attempt suicide by other means during the recovery 
phase. Psychiatric referral may be appropriate. Pediatric Management The principles of management of pediatric and adult overdosages are similar. It is strongly recommended that the physician contact 
the local poison control center for specific pediatric treatment.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: boxed_warning: Boxed Warning SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS: Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in
children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets or 
any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with 
antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other 
psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed 
closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: boxed_warning: Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and 
communication with the prescriber. Amitriptyline hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: boxed_warning: (See WARNINGS: CLINICAL WORSENING AND SUICIDE RISK,

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: 6. Precautions Schizophrenic patients may develop increased symptoms of psychosis; patients with paranoid symptomatology may have an exaggeration of such 
symptoms. Depressed patients, particularly those with known manic-depressive illness, may experience a shift to mania or hypomania. In these circumstances the dose of amitriptyline may be reduced or a
major tranquilizer such as perphenazine may be administered concurrently. The possibility of suicide in depressed patients remains until significant remission occurs. Potentially suicidal patients 
should not have access to large quantities of this drug. Prescriptions should be written for the smallest amount feasible. Concurrent administration of amitriptyline hydrochloride and electroshock 
therapy may increase the hazards associated with such therapy. Such treatment should be limited to patients for whom it is essential. When possible, the drug should be discontinued several days before
elective surgery. Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Amitriptyline hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with 
impaired liver function. Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with 
treatment with amitriptyline hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illnesses, 
and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions” is available for amitriptyline hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the 
Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions 
they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert
their prescriber if these occur while taking amitriptyline hydrochloride. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the 
emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in 
behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be 
advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient’s prescriber or health professional, especially 
if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal
thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. While on therapy with amitriptyline hydrochloride, patients should be advised as to the 
possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Drug Interactions Topiramate Some patients 
may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate and any adjustments in amitriptyline dose should be made according to the patient's clinical response and 
not on the basis of plasma levels. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase)
is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population (about 7 to 10% of Caucasians are so called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among 
Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on 
the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA). In addition, certain drugs inhibit the 
activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers.

HCL: precautions: Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the caucasian 
population (about 7 to 10% of Caucasians are so called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are

2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA). In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal 
metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as 
concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other 
antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and 
paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the 
pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to 
the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active 
metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary). Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either 
the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is 
desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors – see CONTRAINDICATIONS 
section. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Guanethidine or similarly acting compounds; thyroid medication; alcohol, barbiturates and other CNS depressants; and disulfiram – see WARNINGS section. When 
amitriptyline is given with anticholinergic agents or sympathomimetic drugs, including epinephrine combined with local anesthetics, close supervision and careful adjustment of dosages are required. 
Hyperpyrexia has been reported when amitriptyline is administered with anticholinergic agents or with neuroleptic drugs, particularly during hot weather. Paralytic ileus may occur in patients taking 
tricyclic antidepressants in combination with anticholinergic-type drugs. Cimetidine is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain tricyclic antidepressants, thereby delaying elimination and 
increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs. Clinically significant effects have been reported with the tricyclic antidepressants when used concomitantly with cimetidine. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: 
precautions: Increases in plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when cimetidine was added to 
the drug regimen. Discontinuation of cimetidine in well-controlled patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants and cimetidine may decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the antidepressants. 
Caution is advised if patients receive large doses of ethchlorvynol concurrently. Transient delirium has been reported in patients who were treated with one gram of ethchlorvynol and 75 to 150 mg of 
amitriptyline hydrochloride. Geriatric Use Clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient 
should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic function, concomitant disease and other drug therapy in elderly patients.
AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Geriatric patients are particularly sensitive to the anticholinergic side effects of tricyclic antidepressants including amitriptyline hydrochloride. Peripheral 
anticholinergic effects include tachycardia, urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, and exacerbation of narrow-angle glaucoma. Central nervous system anticholinergic effects 
include cognitive impairment, psychomotor slowing, confusion, sedation, and delirium. Elderly patients taking amitriptyline hydrochloride may be at increased risk for falls. Elderly patients should be
started on low doses of amitriptyline hydrochloride and observed closely (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established 
(see BOX WARNING and WARNINGS: CLINICAL WORSENING AND SUICIDE RISK). AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Anyone considering the use of amitriptyline in a child or adolescent must balance the potential 
risks with the clinical need.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: 5. Warnings Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their 
depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist 
until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has 
been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of 
treatment. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal 
thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an 
increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The 
pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 
antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 
short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an 
increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk 
differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 
patients treated) are provided in Table 1. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to 
Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case ≥65 6 fewer case No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were 
suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., 
beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of 
depression. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, 
and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, 
agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients
being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms 
and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. 
AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or 
who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the
patient’s presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be
alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, 
and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for amitriptyline hydrochloride should be 
written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A 
major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an 
antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a 
conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar 
disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that amitriptyline hydrochloride is 
not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Amitriptyline hydrochloride may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or similarly acting compounds. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: It 
should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures and, because of its atropine-like action, in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma or increased 
intraocular pressure. In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, even average doses may precipitate an attack. Patients with cardiovascular disorders should be watched closely. Tricyclic antidepressant 
drugs, including amitriptyline hydrochloride, particularly when given in high doses, have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, and prolongation of the conduction time. Myocardial 
infarction and stroke have been reported with drugs of this class. Close supervision is required when amitriptyline hydrochloride is given to hyperthyroid patients or those receiving thyroid 
medication. Amitriptyline may enhance the response to alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it 
should be borne in mind that the potentiation may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage. Delirium has been reported with concurrent administration of amitriptyline and 
disulfiram. Usage in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Teratogenic effects were not observed in mice, rats, or rabbits when amitriptyline was given orally at doses of 2 to 40 mg/kg/day (up to 13 times 
the maximum recommended human dose 1). Studies in literature have shown amitriptyline to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given by various routes of administration at doses of 28 to 100 
mg/kg/day (9 to 33 times the maximum recommended human dose), producing multiple malformations. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Another study in the rat reported that an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day (8 
times the maximum recommended human dose) produced delays in ossification of fetal vertebral bodies without other signs of embryotoxicity. In rabbits, an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (20 times the 
maximum recommended human dose) was reported to cause incomplete ossification of cranial bones. Amitriptyline has been shown to cross the placenta. Although a causal relationship has not been 
established, there have been a few reports of adverse events, including CNS effects, limb deformities, or developmental delay, in infants whose mothers had taken amitriptyline during pregnancy. There 
are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Amitriptyline hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to 
the fetus.

DO-NOT-KNOW to my inquiry about whether AMITRIPTYLINE HCL increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. This indicates that the FDA label for AMITRIPTYLINE HCL does not 
specify any information regarding its effect on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question based on FDA label data.

<DONE> DO-NOT-KNOW

The justification for this answer is that the FDA label for AMITRIPTYLINE HCL, according to FDAHandler, does not contain information about the drug's impact on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer 
hospitalization. Without this information, it is not possible to determine if AMITRIPTYLINE HCL has an effect on this risk.
