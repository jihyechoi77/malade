CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new 
or worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper 
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects 
and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, 
dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and 
rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe 
and required hospitalization. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be 
instructed to discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences 
appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after 
developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot 
comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: There have been post-marketing 
reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials  . 5.2 Mineral Metabolism
Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with BINOSTO . Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with
these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with BINOSTO. Presumably due to the effects of BINOSTO on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic 
decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur. Patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. 5.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: overdosage: 10 OVERDOSAGE Significant lethality after single oral doses was seen in female rats and mice at 552 mg/kg (3256 mg/m 2 ) and 966 mg/kg (2898 mg/m 2 ), 
respectively. In males, these values were slightly higher, 626 and 1280 mg/kg, respectively. There was no lethality in dogs at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg (4000 mg/m 2 ). No specific information is 
available on the treatment of overdosage with BINOSTO. Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer, 
may result from oral overdosage. Milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate. Due to the risk of esophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully 
upright. Dialysis would not be beneficial.

disease and gastrectomy and who was taking concomitant aspirin developed an anastomotic ulcer with mild hemorrhage, which was considered drug related. Aspirin and alendronate sodium were discontinued 
and the patient recovered. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: adverse_reactions: In the Study 1 and Study 2 populations, 49-54% had a history of gastrointestinal disorders at baseline and 54-89% used nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin at some time during the studies [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Laboratory Test Findings: In double-blind, multicenter, controlled studies, asymptomatic, 
mild, and transient decreases in serum calcium and phosphate were observed in approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of patients taking alendronate versus approximately 12% and 3% of those taking 
placebo. However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to less than 8.0 mg/dL (2.0 mM) and serum phosphate to less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL (0.65 mM) were similar in both treatment groups. 
ALENDRONATE SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Weekly Dosing The safety of alendronate sodium 70 mg once weekly for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in a one-year, double-blind, 
multicenter study comparing alendronate 70 mg once weekly and alendronate 10 mg daily. The overall safety and tolerability profiles of once weekly alendronate 70 mg and alendronate 10 mg daily were 
similar. The adverse reactions considered by the investigators as possibly, probably, or definitely drug related in greater than or equal to 1% of patients in either treatment group are presented in

severe and incapacitating  ; joint swelling; low-energy femoral shaft and subtrochanteric fractures  . Nervous system : dizziness and vertigo. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Pulmonary: acute 
asthma exacerbations Skin : rash (occasionally with photosensitivity), pruritus, alopecia, severe skin reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Special Senses :

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if ALENDRONATE SODIUM increases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that Alendronate sodium may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa and has been associated with esophageal adverse experiences such as esophagitis, 
esophageal ulcers, and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, which have required hospitalization. There have also been

        -----
        Final answer: ALENDRONATE SODIUM has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects that can be severe and may lead to hospitalization, such as esophageal ulcers and erosions. However, 
it is important to note that while there have been post-marketing reports of severe gastric and duodenal ulcers with complications, no increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization was 
observed in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, while there is a potential risk, the degree of reliability of this association is not fully established, and the risk of hospitalization due to 
gastrointestinal ulcers appears to be rare.

ALENDRONATE SODIUM has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects that can be severe and may lead to hospitalization, such as esophageal ulcers and erosions. However, it is important to 
note that while there have been post-marketing reports of severe gastric and duodenal ulcers with complications, no increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization was observed in controlled
