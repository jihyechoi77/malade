[31mCONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS An antiemetic effect was observed in animal studies with thiothixene; since this effect may also occur in man, it is possible that thiothixene may mask [0m
[31msigns of overdosage of toxic drugs and may obscure conditions such as intestinal obstruction and brain tumor. In consideration of the known capability of thiothixene and certain other psychotropic [0m
[31mdrugs to precipitate convulsions, extreme caution should be used in patients with a history of convulsive disorders or those in a state of alcohol withdrawal, since it may lower the convulsive [0m

[31mdrugs to precipitate convulsions, extreme caution should be used in patients with a history of convulsive disorders or those in a state of alcohol withdrawal, since it may lower the convulsive [0m

[31mconsisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene [0m[1;31m1[0m[31m . Although the prevalence of the syndrome [0m
[31mappears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely[0m
[31mto develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the [0m
[31mlikelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, [0m
[31mthe syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the [0m
[31msyndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress [0m[1;31m([0m[31mor partially suppress[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m the signs and symptoms of the [0m
[31msyndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, [0m
[31mantipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be [0m
[31mreserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, [0m[1;31m1[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and [0m[1;31m2[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are[0m
[31mnot available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The [0m
[31mneed for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, [0m
[31msome patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome. [0m[1;31m([0m[31mFor further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to ‚Äú Information[0m

[31mdrug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Pregnancy Safe use of thiothixene during pregnancy has not been [0m
[31mestablished. Therefore, this drug should be given to pregnant patients only when, in the judgment of the physician, the expected benefits from the treatment exceed the possible risks to mother and [0m

[31mseverity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Thiothixene should be used during [0m
[31mpregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Animal reproduction studies and clinical experience to date have not demonstrated any teratogenic effects. In the [0m
[31manimal reproduction studies with thiothixene, there was some decrease in conception rate and litter size, and an increase in resorption rate in rats and rabbits. Similar findings have been reported [0m

[31mestablished. As is true with many CNS drugs, thiothixene may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating [0m
[31mmachinery, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, the patient should be cautioned accordingly. As in the case of other CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving thiothixene should be [0m
[31mcautioned about the possible additive effects [0m[1;31m([0m[31mwhich may include hypotension[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m with CNS depressants and with alcohol.         [0m

[31mCONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS An antiemetic effect was observed in animal studies with thiothixene; since this effect may also occur in man, it is possible that thiothixene may mask [0m
[31msigns of overdosage of toxic drugs and may obscure conditions such as intestinal obstruction and brain tumor. In consideration of the known capability of thiothixene and certain other psychotropic [0m
[31mdrugs to precipitate convulsions, extreme caution should be used in patients with a history of convulsive disorders or those in a state of alcohol withdrawal, since it may lower the convulsive [0m
[31mthreshold. Although thiothixene potentiates the actions of the barbiturates, the dosage of the anticonvulsant therapy should not be reduced when thiothixene is administered concurrently. Though [0m
[31mexhibiting rather weak anticholinergic properties, thiothixene should be used with caution in patients who might be exposed to extreme heat or who are receiving atropine or related drugs. THIOTHIXENE:[0m
[31mprecautions: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease. Caution as well as careful adjustment of the dosages is indicated when thiothixene is used in conjunction with other CNS [0m

[31mAntipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene [0m[1;31m3[0m[31m , elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Tissue culture experiments indicate that [0m
[31mapproximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously [0m
[31mdetected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown [0m
[31mfor most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date,[0m
[31mhowever, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. THIOTHIXENE:[0m

[31mtherapy and discontinuation of thiothixene should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically [0m
[31msignificant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Patients with [0m

[31mexposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The [0m

[31mCONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS An antiemetic effect was observed in animal studies with thiothixene; since this effect may also occur in man, it is possible that thiothixene may mask [0m
[31msigns of overdosage of toxic drugs and may obscure conditions such as intestinal obstruction and brain tumor. In consideration of the known capability of thiothixene and certain other psychotropic [0m
[31mdrugs to precipitate convulsions, extreme caution should be used in patients with a history of convulsive disorders or those in a state of alcohol withdrawal, since it may lower the convulsive [0m
[31mthreshold. Although thiothixene potentiates the actions of the barbiturates, the dosage of the anticonvulsant therapy should not be reduced when thiothixene is administered concurrently. Though [0m
[31mexhibiting rather weak anticholinergic properties, thiothixene should be used with caution in patients who might be exposed to extreme heat or who are receiving atropine or related drugs.         [0m
