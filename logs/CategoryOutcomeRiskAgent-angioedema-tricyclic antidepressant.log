                Passages:
                1. Drug DOXEPIN HCL: The FDA label for DOXEPIN HCL does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of angioedema. However, since allergic reactions like skin rash, 
edema, and pruritus have occasionally occurred, there is a potential for allergic-type reactions that could include angioedema. The degree of risk for angioedema specifically is not detailed in the 
label, so it cannot be stated with certainty whether DOXEPIN HCL increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.
2. Drug DESIPRAMINE: The FDA label for Desipramine does not specify information regarding the risk of angioedema associated with its use. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not 
possible to determine whether Desipramine increases or decreases the risk of angioedema. 

 DO-NOT-KNOW

Justification: The FDA label data, which is the source of information for this inquiry, does not mention angioedema as a side effect or a condition affected by Desipramine. Consequently, there is no 
reliable information to suggest that Desipramine has an effect on the risk of angioedema.
3. Drug AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: The FDA label for AMITRIPTYLINE HCL does not specifically mention angioedema as a known adverse reaction or risk. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, it is not possible 
to determine whether AMITRIPTYLINE HCL increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 (DOXEPIN HCL): Indicates a potential for allergic-type reactions, which could include angioedema, but the specific risk for angioedema is not detailed.
2. Passage 2 (DESIPRAMINE): The FDA label does not specify information regarding the risk of angioedema, so no determination can be made based on this data.
3. Passage 3 (AMITRIPTYLINE HCL): The FDA label does not mention angioedema as a known adverse reaction or risk, so no determination can be made based on this data.
4. Overall, the provided passages do not give specific information about the risk of angioedema for the tricyclic antidepressant category as a whole. The evidence is either non-specific or absent.

        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the tricyclic antidepressant category of drugs on the risk of angioedema based on the provided passages.
