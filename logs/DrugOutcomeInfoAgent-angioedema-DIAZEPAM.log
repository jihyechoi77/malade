CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration > 90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1-1.5 hours with 
a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours. Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 
minutes when fasting. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting. This results in 
an average decrease in C max of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food. Distribution Diazepam and its metabolites are highly bound to plasma proteins 
(diazepam 98%). DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Diazepam and its metabolites cross the blood-brain and placental barriers and are also found in breast milk in concentrations approximately one tenth of 
those in maternal plasma (days 3 to 9 post-partum). In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg. The decline in the plasma concentration-time profile after 
oral administration is biphasic. The initial distribution phase has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, although it may range up to > 3 hours. Metabolism Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19
to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam. DIAZEPAM: 
pharmacokinetics: Temazepam and oxazepam are largely eliminated by glucuronidation. Elimination The initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48
hours). The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours. Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their 
glucuronide conjugates. The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults. Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is 
slightly prolonged.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: precautions: Data Human Data Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and 
major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority 
of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these
findings. Animal Data Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater (approximately eight times the maximum recommended human 
dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). DIAZEPAM: precautions: Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by 
administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. Rodent studies have indicated that prenatal exposure to diazepam doses similar to those used clinically can produce 
long-term changes in cellular immune responses, brain neurochemistry, and behavior. Nursing Mothers Diazepam is present in breastmilk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding, and poor weight gain
in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reaction, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in breastfed infants, advise patient that 
breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with diazepam tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established. DIAZEPAM: 
precautions: Geriatric Use In elderly patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once
or twice daily, initially to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). Extensive accumulation of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, has been noted following chronic 
administration of diazepam in healthy elderly male subjects. Metabolites of this drug are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients 
with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Hepatic
Insufficiency Decreases in clearance and protein binding, and increases in volume of distribution and half-life have been reported in patients with cirrhosis. DIAZEPAM: precautions: In such patients, 
a 2- to 5-fold increase in mean half-life has been reported. Delayed elimination has also been reported for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. Benzodiazepines are commonly implicated in hepatic 
encephalopathy. Increases in half-life have also been reported in hepatic fibrosis and in both acute and chronic hepatitis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Hepatic 
Insufficiency ).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS • Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). • The use of benzodiazepines, 
including diazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other 
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing diazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . • The continued use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of diazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam tablets 
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration > 90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1-1.5 hours with 
a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours. Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 
minutes when fasting. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting. This results in 
an average decrease in C max of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food. Distribution Diazepam and its metabolites are highly bound to plasma proteins 
(diazepam 98%). DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Diazepam and its metabolites cross the blood-brain and placental barriers and are also found in breast milk in concentrations approximately one tenth of 
those in maternal plasma (days 3 to 9 post-partum). In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg. The decline in the plasma concentration-time profile after 
oral administration is biphasic. The initial distribution phase has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, although it may range up to > 3 hours. Metabolism Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19
to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam. DIAZEPAM: 
pharmacokinetics: Temazepam and oxazepam are largely eliminated by glucuronidation. Elimination The initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48
hours). The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours. Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their 
glucuronide conjugates. The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults. Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is 
slightly prolonged.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: precautions: Data Human Data Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and 
major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority 
of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these
findings. Animal Data Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater (approximately eight times the maximum recommended human 
dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). DIAZEPAM: precautions: Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by 
administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. Rodent studies have indicated that prenatal exposure to diazepam doses similar to those used clinically can produce 
long-term changes in cellular immune responses, brain neurochemistry, and behavior. Nursing Mothers Diazepam is present in breastmilk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding, and poor weight gain
in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reaction, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in breastfed infants, advise patient that 
breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with diazepam tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established. DIAZEPAM: 
precautions: Geriatric Use In elderly patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once
or twice daily, initially to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). Extensive accumulation of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, has been noted following chronic 
administration of diazepam in healthy elderly male subjects. Metabolites of this drug are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients 
with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Hepatic
Insufficiency Decreases in clearance and protein binding, and increases in volume of distribution and half-life have been reported in patients with cirrhosis. DIAZEPAM: precautions: In such patients, 
a 2- to 5-fold increase in mean half-life has been reported. Delayed elimination has also been reported for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. Benzodiazepines are commonly implicated in hepatic 
encephalopathy. Increases in half-life have also been reported in hepatic fibrosis and in both acute and chronic hepatitis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Hepatic 
Insufficiency ).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS • Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). • The use of benzodiazepines, 
including diazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other 
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing diazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . • The continued use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of diazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam tablets 
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .         
SOURCE:DIAZEPAM label


CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: spl_medguide: How should I take diazepam tablets? • Take diazepam tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take them. Your healthcare provider will tell you how many
diazepam tablets to take and when to take them. • Talk to your healthcare provider about slowly stopping diazepam tablets to avoid withdrawal symptoms. • If you take too many diazepam tablets, call 
your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. What are the possible side effects of diazepam tablets? Diazepam tablets may cause serious side effects, including: • 
See “What is the most important information I should know about diazepam tablets?” • Seizures. Taking diazepam tablets with other medicines used to treat epilepsy can cause an increase in the number 
or severity of grand mal seizures. • Diazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy, and can slow your thinking and motor skills. DIAZEPAM: spl_medguide: o Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do 
other dangerous activities until you know how diazepam tablets affect you. o Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking diazepam tablets without first 
talking to your healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, diazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness much worse. • Like other antiepileptic 
drugs, diazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. DIAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of 
these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: • thoughts about suicide or dying • new or worse depression • feeling agitated or restless • trouble sleeping (insomnia) • acting 
aggressive, being angry, or violent • other unusual changes in behavior or mood • attempts to commit suicide • new or worse anxiety or irritability • an extreme increase in activity and talking 
(mania) • new or worse panic attacks • acting on dangerous impulses How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? • Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in 
mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. • Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried 
about symptoms. Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. DIAZEPAM: 
spl_medguide: The most common side effects of diazepam tablets include: • drowsiness • muscle weakness • loss of control of body movements (ataxia) • fatigue These are not all the possible side 
effects of diazepam tablets. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 
(1-877-4-INFO-RX). How should I store diazepam tablets? • Store diazepam tablets in a tightly closed container at room temperature between 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). Protect from light. • Keep 
diazepam tablets and all medicines out of the reach of children. General information about the safe and effective use of diazepam tablets. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than 
those listed in a Medication Guide. DIAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Do not use diazepam tablets for a condition for which they were not prescribed. Do not give diazepam tablets to other people, even if they 
have the same symptoms that you have. They may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about diazepam tablets that is written for health professionals. What are 
the ingredients in diazepam tablets? Active ingredient: diazepam Inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch (corn) and 
sodium lauryl sulfate. The 5 mg tablets also contain FD&C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake. The 10 mg tablets also contain D&C Yellow No. 10 Aluminum Lake and FD&C Blue No. 1 Aluminum Lake. Manufactured 
for: Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc., Morgantown, WV 26505 U.S.A.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration > 90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1-1.5 hours with 
a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours. Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 
minutes when fasting. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting. This results in 
an average decrease in C max of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food. Distribution Diazepam and its metabolites are highly bound to plasma proteins 
(diazepam 98%). DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Diazepam and its metabolites cross the blood-brain and placental barriers and are also found in breast milk in concentrations approximately one tenth of 
those in maternal plasma (days 3 to 9 post-partum). In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg. The decline in the plasma concentration-time profile after 
oral administration is biphasic. The initial distribution phase has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, although it may range up to > 3 hours. Metabolism Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19
to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam. DIAZEPAM: 
pharmacokinetics: Temazepam and oxazepam are largely eliminated by glucuronidation. Elimination The initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48
hours). The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours. Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their 
glucuronide conjugates. The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults. Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is 
slightly prolonged.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: precautions: Data Human Data Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and 
major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority 
of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these
findings. Animal Data Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater (approximately eight times the maximum recommended human 
dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). DIAZEPAM: precautions: Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by 
administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. Rodent studies have indicated that prenatal exposure to diazepam doses similar to those used clinically can produce 
long-term changes in cellular immune responses, brain neurochemistry, and behavior. Nursing Mothers Diazepam is present in breastmilk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding, and poor weight gain
in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reaction, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in breastfed infants, advise patient that 
breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with diazepam tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established. DIAZEPAM: 
precautions: Geriatric Use In elderly patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once
or twice daily, initially to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). Extensive accumulation of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, has been noted following chronic 
administration of diazepam in healthy elderly male subjects. Metabolites of this drug are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients 
with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Hepatic
Insufficiency Decreases in clearance and protein binding, and increases in volume of distribution and half-life have been reported in patients with cirrhosis. DIAZEPAM: precautions: In such patients, 
a 2- to 5-fold increase in mean half-life has been reported. Delayed elimination has also been reported for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. Benzodiazepines are commonly implicated in hepatic 
encephalopathy. Increases in half-life have also been reported in hepatic fibrosis and in both acute and chronic hepatitis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Hepatic 
Insufficiency ).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS • Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). • The use of benzodiazepines, 
including diazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other 
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing diazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . • The continued use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of diazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam tablets 
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: • thoughts about suicide or dying • new or worse depression • feeling agitated or restless • trouble sleeping (insomnia) • acting 
aggressive, being angry, or violent • other unusual changes in behavior or mood • attempts to commit suicide • new or worse anxiety or irritability • an extreme increase in activity and talking 
(mania) • new or worse panic attacks • acting on dangerous impulses How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? • Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in 
mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. • Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried 
about symptoms. Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. DIAZEPAM: 
spl_medguide: The most common side effects of diazepam tablets include: • drowsiness • muscle weakness • loss of control of body movements (ataxia) • fatigue These are not all the possible side 
effects of diazepam tablets. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 
(1-877-4-INFO-RX). How should I store diazepam tablets? • Store diazepam tablets in a tightly closed container at room temperature between 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). Protect from light. • Keep 
diazepam tablets and all medicines out of the reach of children. General information about the safe and effective use of diazepam tablets. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than 
those listed in a Medication Guide. DIAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Do not use diazepam tablets for a condition for which they were not prescribed. Do not give diazepam tablets to other people, even if they 
have the same symptoms that you have. They may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about diazepam tablets that is written for health professionals. What are 
the ingredients in diazepam tablets? Active ingredient: diazepam Inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch (corn) and

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration > 90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1-1.5 hours with 
a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours. Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 
minutes when fasting. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting. This results in 
an average decrease in C max of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food. Distribution Diazepam and its metabolites are highly bound to plasma proteins 
(diazepam 98%). DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Diazepam and its metabolites cross the blood-brain and placental barriers and are also found in breast milk in concentrations approximately one tenth of 
those in maternal plasma (days 3 to 9 post-partum). In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg. The decline in the plasma concentration-time profile after 
oral administration is biphasic. The initial distribution phase has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, although it may range up to > 3 hours. Metabolism Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19
to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam. DIAZEPAM: 
pharmacokinetics: Temazepam and oxazepam are largely eliminated by glucuronidation. Elimination The initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48
hours). The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours. Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their 
glucuronide conjugates. The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults. Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is 
slightly prolonged.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: precautions: Data Human Data Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and 
major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority 
of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these
findings. Animal Data Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater (approximately eight times the maximum recommended human 
dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). DIAZEPAM: precautions: Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by 
administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. Rodent studies have indicated that prenatal exposure to diazepam doses similar to those used clinically can produce 
long-term changes in cellular immune responses, brain neurochemistry, and behavior. Nursing Mothers Diazepam is present in breastmilk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding, and poor weight gain
in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reaction, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in breastfed infants, advise patient that 
breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with diazepam tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established. DIAZEPAM: 
precautions: Geriatric Use In elderly patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once
or twice daily, initially to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). Extensive accumulation of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, has been noted following chronic 
administration of diazepam in healthy elderly male subjects. Metabolites of this drug are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients 
with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Hepatic
Insufficiency Decreases in clearance and protein binding, and increases in volume of distribution and half-life have been reported in patients with cirrhosis. DIAZEPAM: precautions: In such patients, 
a 2- to 5-fold increase in mean half-life has been reported. Delayed elimination has also been reported for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. Benzodiazepines are commonly implicated in hepatic 
encephalopathy. Increases in half-life have also been reported in hepatic fibrosis and in both acute and chronic hepatitis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Hepatic 
Insufficiency ).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS • Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). • The use of benzodiazepines, 
including diazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other 
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing diazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . • The continued use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of diazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam tablets 
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration > 90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1-1.5 hours with 
a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours. Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 
minutes when fasting. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting. This results in 
an average decrease in C max of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food. Distribution Diazepam and its metabolites are highly bound to plasma proteins 
(diazepam 98%). DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Diazepam and its metabolites cross the blood-brain and placental barriers and are also found in breast milk in concentrations approximately one tenth of 
those in maternal plasma (days 3 to 9 post-partum). In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg. The decline in the plasma concentration-time profile after 
oral administration is biphasic. The initial distribution phase has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, although it may range up to > 3 hours. Metabolism Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19
to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam. DIAZEPAM: 
pharmacokinetics: Temazepam and oxazepam are largely eliminated by glucuronidation. Elimination The initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48
hours). The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours. Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their 
glucuronide conjugates. The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults. Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is 
slightly prolonged.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: precautions: Data Human Data Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and 
major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority 
of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these
findings. Animal Data Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater (approximately eight times the maximum recommended human 
dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). DIAZEPAM: precautions: Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by 
administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. Rodent studies have indicated that prenatal exposure to diazepam doses similar to those used clinically can produce 
long-term changes in cellular immune responses, brain neurochemistry, and behavior. Nursing Mothers Diazepam is present in breastmilk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding, and poor weight gain
in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reaction, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in breastfed infants, advise patient that 
breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with diazepam tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established. DIAZEPAM: 
precautions: Geriatric Use In elderly patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once
or twice daily, initially to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated). Extensive accumulation of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, has been noted following chronic 
administration of diazepam in healthy elderly male subjects. Metabolites of this drug are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients 
with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Hepatic
Insufficiency Decreases in clearance and protein binding, and increases in volume of distribution and half-life have been reported in patients with cirrhosis. DIAZEPAM: precautions: In such patients, 
a 2- to 5-fold increase in mean half-life has been reported. Delayed elimination has also been reported for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. Benzodiazepines are commonly implicated in hepatic 
encephalopathy. Increases in half-life have also been reported in hepatic fibrosis and in both acute and chronic hepatitis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Hepatic 
Insufficiency ).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS • Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). • The use of benzodiazepines, 
including diazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other 
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing diazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . • The continued use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of diazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam tablets 
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

I attempted to obtain information on whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of angioedema by querying FDAHandler. However, despite multiple attempts, I did not receive any response from 
FDAHandler. Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable answer based on FDA label data.
