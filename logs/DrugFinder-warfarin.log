[31m        Feedback: The reasoning provided contains a significant flaw. Warfarin is a specific anticoagulant drug, and while [0m[31m'Warfarin Sodium'[0m[31m and [0m[31m'Warfarin'[0m[31m refer to the same active ingredient, [0m
[31m'Jantoven'[0m[31m is simply a brand name for warfarin. Therefore, [0m[31m'WARFARIN SODIUM'[0m[31m, [0m[31m'JANTOVEN'[0m[31m, and [0m[31m'WARFARIN'[0m[31m do not represent distinct members of the category warfarin of drugs; they are all the same [0m
[31mdrug, just in different forms or under different names. The task was to identify distinct members of the category, which in the case of warfarin, there are none, as warfarin is a single compound. The [0m
[31mcorrect answer should acknowledge that warfarin is the only representative of its category, and any brand names or salt forms are not distinct members but the same drug.[0m
