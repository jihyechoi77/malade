        Below are some relevant extracts for your query:
        -----
        
CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Distribution Preclinical studies (in male rats) show that alendronate sodium transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/kg IV 
administration but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine. The mean steady-state volume of distribution, exclusive of bone, is at least 28 L in humans. Concentrations of drug 
in plasma following therapeutic oral doses are too low (less than 5 ng/mL) for analytical detection. Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%. Metabolism There is no evidence that 
alendronate sodium is metabolized in animals or humans. Excretion Following a single IV dose of [ 14 C]alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and
little or no radioactivity was recovered in the feces. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Following a single 10 mg IV dose, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 mL/min (64, 78; 90% 
confidence interval [CI]), and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 mL/min. Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within 6 hours following IV administration. The terminal half-life in humans is
estimated to exceed 10 years, probably reflecting release of alendronate from the skeleton. Based on the above, it is estimated that after 10 years of oral treatment with alendronate sodium (10 mg 
daily) the amount of alendronate released daily from the skeleton is approximately 25% of that absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Specific Populations Gender: Bioavailability and the fraction 
of an intravenous dose excreted in urine were similar in men and women. Geriatric: Bioavailability and disposition (urinary excretion) were similar in elderly and younger patients. No dosage 
adjustment is necessary in elderly patients . ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Renal Impairment: Preclinical studies show
that, in rats with kidney failure, increasing amounts of drug are present in plasma, kidney, spleen, and tibia. In healthy controls, drug that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the 
urine. No evidence of saturation of bone uptake was found after 3 weeks dosing with cumulative intravenous doses of 35 mg/kg in young male rats. Although no formal renal impairment pharmacokinetic 
study has been conducted in patients, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, somewhat greater 
accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min. ALENDRONATE 
SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: BINOSTO is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with alendronate in renal failure. Hepatic Impairment: As
there is evidence that alendronate is not metabolized or excreted in the bile, no studies were conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary. Drug Interactions 
Ranitidine: Intravenous ranitidine was shown to double the bioavailability of oral alendronate. The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and whether similar increases will occur in 
patients given oral H 2 -antagonists is unknown. Prednisone: In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) did not produce a clinically meaningful change in the oral 
bioavailability of alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20 to 44%). ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Calcium and Multivalent Cations: Products containing calcium and other multivalent 
cations are likely to interfere with absorption of alendronate. Levothyroxine: The geometric mean AUC(0-âˆž) and C max of alendronate decreased by 7% (point estimate: 0.93; 90% CI: 0.79-1.08) and 9% 
(point estimate: 0.91; 90% CI: 0.77-1.08), respectively, when a single dose of BINOSTO (70 mg alendronate) and 600 mcg levothyroxine were given concomitantly to 29 healthy male and female subjects.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone 
resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. In 
osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline 
phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline 
phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year 
studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of 
bone turnover reached a new steady state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone. As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic 
reductions in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium 
(approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate sodium 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the 
five-year duration of treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: Similar reductions were observed with 
alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not
only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption. Osteoporosis in Men Treatment of men with osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 
mg/day for two years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40%. Similar reductions 
were observed in a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg.

ANSWER: Alendronate sodium does not appear to directly increase or decrease the risk of renal failure. However, the drug's clearance is affected by renal function. In patients with impaired renal 
function, there is likely to be reduced elimination of alendronate via the kidneys, which could lead to greater accumulation of the drug in bone. Alendronate sodium is not recommended for patients 
with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with the drug in renal failure. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min.

        Question: Does ALENDRONATE SODIUM increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether ALENDRONATE SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler responded that Alendronate sodium does not appear to directly increase or decrease the risk of renal failure. However, the drug's clearance is affected by renal function, and in patients
with impaired renal function, there is likely to be reduced elimination of alendronate, which could lead to greater accumulation of the drug in bone. Alendronate sodium is not recommended for patients
with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with the drug in renal failure. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min.

        Final answer: Alendronate sodium does not appear to directly increase or decrease the risk of renal failure according to the FDA label. However, it is not recommended for patients with 
severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min) due to lack of experience with the drug in such cases. For patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine
