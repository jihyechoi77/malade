CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: WARNING SERIOUS DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS AND HLA-B*1502 ALLELE SERIOUS AND SOMETIMES FATAL DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS, INCLUDING TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS (TEN) AND 
STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME (SJS), HAVE BEEN REPORTED DURING TREATMENT WITH CARBAMAZEPINE. THESE REACTIONS ARE ESTIMATED TO OCCUR IN 1 TO 6 PER 10,000 NEW USERS IN COUNTRIES WITH MAINLY CAUCASIAN 
POPULATIONS, BUT THE RISK IN SOME ASIAN COUNTRIES IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 10 TIMES HIGHER. CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: STUDIES IN PATIENTS OF CHINESE ANCESTRY HAVE FOUND A STRONG ASSOCIATION 
BETWEEN THE RISK OF DEVELOPING SJS/TEN AND THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502, AN INHERITED ALLELIC VARIANT OF THE HLA-B GENE. HLA-B*1502 IS FOUND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY ACROSS BROAD 
AREAS OF ASIA. PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY IN GENETICALLY AT-RISK POPULATIONS SHOULD BE SCREENED FOR THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502 PRIOR TO INITIATING TREATMENT WITH CARBAMAZEPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: PATIENTS TESTING POSITIVE FOR THE ALLELE SHOULD NOT BE TREATED WITH CARBAMAZEPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES UNLESS THE BENEFIT CLEARLY OUTWEIGHS THE RISK ( SEE WARNINGS 
AND PRECAUTIONS/LABORATORY TESTS ). APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF CARBAMAZEPINE. DATA FROM A 
POPULATION-BASED CASE-CONTROL STUDY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RISK OF DEVELOPING THESE REACTIONS IS 5 to 8 TIMES GREATER THAN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: HOWEVER, THE OVERALL 
RISK OF THESE REACTIONS IN THE UNTREATED GENERAL POPULATION IS LOW, APPROXIMATELY SIX PATIENTS PER ONE MILLION POPULATION PER YEAR FOR AGRANULOCYTOSIS AND TWO PATIENTS PER ONE MILLION POPULATION PER 
YEAR FOR APLASTIC ANEMIA. ALTHOUGH REPORTS OF TRANSIENT OR PERSISTENT DECREASED PLATELET OR WHITE BLOOD CELL COUNTS ARE NOT UNCOMMON IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF CARBAMAZEPINE, DATA ARE NOT 
AVAILABLE TO ESTIMATE ACCURATELY THEIR INCIDENCE OR OUTCOME. HOWEVER, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CASES OF LEUKOPENIA HAVE NOT PROGRESSED TO THE MORE SERIOUS CONDITIONS OF APLASTIC ANEMIA OR 
AGRANULOCYTOSIS. CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: BECAUSE OF THE VERY LOW INCIDENCE OF AGRANULOCYTOSIS AND APLASTIC ANEMIA, THE VAST MAJORITY OF MINOR HEMATOLOGIC CHANGES OBSERVED IN MONITORING OF 
PATIENTS ON CARBAMAZEPINE ARE UNLIKELY TO SIGNAL THE OCCURRENCE OF EITHER ABNORMALITY. NONETHELESS, COMPLETE PRETREATMENT HEMATOLOGICAL TESTING SHOULD BE OBTAINED AS A BASELINE. IF A PATIENT IN THE 
COURSE OF TREATMENT EXHIBITS LOW OR DECREASED WHITE BLOOD CELL OR PLATELET COUNTS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE MONITORED CLOSELY. DISCONTINUATION OF THE DRUG SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IF ANY EVIDENCE OF 
SIGNIFICANT BONE MARROW DEPRESSION DEVELOPS.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: For severe cases of carbamazepine overdose unresponsive to other measures, charcoal hemoperfusion may be used to enhance drug clearance. Respiratory Depression: 
Keep the airways free; resort, if necessary, to endotracheal intubation, artificial respiration, and administration of oxygen. Hypotension, Shock: Keep the patient's legs raised and administer a 
plasma expander. If blood pressure fails to rise despite measures taken to increase plasma volume, use of vasoactive substances should be considered. Convulsions: Diazepam or barbiturates. Warning: 
Diazepam or barbiturates may aggravate respiratory depression (especially in children), hypotension, and coma. However, barbiturates should not be used if drugs that inhibit monoamine oxidase have 
also been taken by the patient either in overdosage or in recent therapy (within 1 week). CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Surveillance: Respiration, cardiac function (ECG monitoring), blood pressure, body 
temperature, pupillary reflexes, and kidney and bladder function should be monitored for several days. Treatment of Blood Count Abnormalities: If evidence of significant bone marrow depression 
develops, the following recommendations are suggested: (1) stop the drug, (2) perform daily CBC, platelet, and reticulocyte counts, (3) do a bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy immediately and 
repeat with sufficient frequency to monitor recovery. CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Special periodic studies might be helpful as follows: (1) white cell and platelet antibodies, (2) 59 Fe-ferrokinetic 
studies, (3) peripheral blood cell typing, (4) cytogenetic studies on marrow and peripheral blood, (5) bone marrow culture studies for colony-forming units, (6) hemoglobin electrophoresis for A2 and F
hemoglobin, and (7) serum folic acid and B 12 levels. A fully developed aplastic anemia will require appropriate, intensive monitoring and therapy, for which specialized consultation should be sought.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Chinese ancestry taking other anti-epileptic drugs 
associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 positive patients, when alternative therapies are 
otherwise equally acceptable. Patients should be made aware that carbamazepine extended-release capsules contain carbamazepine and should not be used in combination with any other medications 
containing carbamazepine. Hypersensitivity Reactions and HLA-A*3101 Allele Retrospective case-control studies in patients of European, Korean, and Japanese ancestry have found a moderate association 
between the risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions and the presence of HLA-A*3101, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-A gene, in patients using carbamazepine. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: 
These hypersensitivity reactions include SJS/TEN, maculopapular eruptions, and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (see DRESS/Multiorgan hypersensitivity below). HLA-A*3101 is 
expected to be carried by more than 15% of patients of Japanese, Native American, Southern Indian (e.g., Tamil Nadu) and some Arabic ancestry; up to about 10% in patients of Han Chinese, Korean, 
European, Latin American and other Indian ancestry; and up to about 5% in African-Americans and patients of Thai, Taiwanese, and Chinese (Hong Kong) ancestry. The risks and benefits of carbamazepine 
therapy should be weighed before considering carbamazepine in patients known to be positive for HLA-A*3101. General Information on HLA Genotyping and Hypersensitivity Application of HLA genotyping as 
a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Many HLA-B*1502-positive and 
HLA-A*3101-positive patients treated with carbamazepine will not develop SJS/TEN or other hypersensitivity reactions, and these reactions can still occur infrequently in HLA-B*1502-negative and 
HLA-A*3101-negative patients of any ethnicity. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN and other hypersensitivity reactions, such as AED dose, compliance,
concomitant medications, co-morbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. Aplastic Anemia and Agranulocytosis Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported in 
association with the use of carbamazepine. (See BOXED WARNING .) Patients with a history of adverse hematologic reaction to any drug may be particularly at risk of bone marrow depression. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as 
multiorgan hypersensitivity, have occurred with carbamazepine. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, 
lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an 
acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early 
manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Carbamazepine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine 
have been reported in patients who previously experienced this reaction to anticonvulsants including phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital. A history of hypersensitivity reactions should be obtained
for patients and their immediate family members. If such history is present, benefits and risks should be carefully considered, and, if carbamazepine is initiated, the signs and symptoms of 
hypersensitivity should be carefully monitored. In patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine, approximately 25 to 30% may experience hypersensitivity reactions with 
oxcarbazepine (Trileptal ® ).

ANSWER: CARBAMAZEPINE increases the risk of aplastic anemia. Data from a population-based case-control study demonstrate that the risk of developing aplastic anemia is 5 to 8 times greater than in the
general population. However, the overall risk of these reactions in the untreated general population is low, approximately two patients per one million population per year for aplastic anemia.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if CARBAMAZEPINE increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.
2. FDAHandler responded that CARBAMAZEPINE increases the risk of aplastic anemia. Data from a population-based case-control study demonstrate that the risk of developing aplastic anemia is 5 to 8 
times greater than in the general population. However, the overall risk of these reactions in the untreated general population is low, approximately two patients per one million population per year 
for aplastic anemia.
        -----
        Final answer: CARBAMAZEPINE increases the risk of aplastic anemia, although the overall risk in the general population is low.

CARBAMAZEPINE increases the risk of aplastic anemia. According to data from a population-based case-control study, the risk of developing aplastic anemia is 5 to 8 times greater in patients taking 
CARBAMAZEPINE than in the general population. However, it's important to note that the overall risk of aplastic anemia in the untreated general population is quite low, at approximately two cases per 
one million people per year.
