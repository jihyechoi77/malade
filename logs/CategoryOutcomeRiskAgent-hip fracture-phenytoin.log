[31m        [0m[1;31m1[0m[31m. Passage [0m[1;31m1[0m[31m and [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m indicate that there is no available information from the FDA regarding the effects of Phenytoin Sodium and Phenytoin on the risk of hip fracture. This lack of evidence leads[0m
[31mto the conclusion that for these drugs, there is no known effect on the risk of hip fracture.[0m
[1;31m2[0m[31m. Passage [0m[1;31m3[0m[31m provides information that Extended Phenytoin Sodium may increase the risk of hip fracture due to its potential to cause bone softening conditions such as osteopenia, osteoporosis, and [0m
[31mosteomalacia.[0m
[1;31m3[0m[31m. The evidence for an increased risk of hip fracture is specific to Extended Phenytoin Sodium and cannot be extrapolated to the other drugs within the category without direct evidence.[0m
[1;31m4[0m[31m. Therefore, for Phenytoin Sodium and Phenytoin, the effect on the risk of hip fracture is considered to be [0m[31m'no-effect'[0m[31m due to the absence of evidence. For Extended Phenytoin Sodium, there is an [0m

[31m        Final answer: For Phenytoin Sodium and Phenytoin, there is no evidence of an effect on the risk of hip fracture, so they are considered to have [0m[31m'no-effect'[0m[31m. For Extended Phenytoin Sodium, [0m
