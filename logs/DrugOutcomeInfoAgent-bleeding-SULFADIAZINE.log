[32mThe question was whether SULFADIAZINE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding. The steps taken to answer this question included consulting FDAHandler, which provided information from the [0m
[32mSULFADIAZINE label. The label does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of bleeding. However, it does list potential adverse reactions such as thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, [0m
[32mwhich can be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. It is important to note that these reactions are potential and not guaranteed to occur in all patients. Therefore, while there is a [0m
[32mpotential association with an increased risk of bleeding due to these blood dyscrasias, the degree of risk is not specified in the label, and these reactions are not guaranteed to occur in all [0m
[32mpatients.[0m
