[32mThe FDA label for ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE does not specifically mention an increased risk of angioedema, but it does list allergic reactions as side effects, which could potentially include [0m
[32mangioedema. Therefore, while angioedema is not explicitly listed, it may be a possible side effect within the spectrum of allergic reactions to the drug.[0m
