[34mlead to deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure in certain populations, such as elderly patients, those who are volume-depleted, or those with compromised renal [0m
[34mfunction, especially when co-administered with NSAIDs. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors like lisinopril is associated with an increased risk of changes in renal [0m
[34mfunction, including acute renal failure. However, in patients with severe congestive heart failure or with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, treatment with lisinopril may be associated [0m
[34mwith oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death, which are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. It is important to [0m
[34mmonitor renal function in patients receiving lisinopril, especially those with pre-existing renal impairment or those on diuretic therapy.[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. Drug CAPTOPRIL: CAPTOPRIL can potentially increase the risk of renal failure in some patients, especially those with pre-existing renal disease or severe renal artery stenosis. However, the [0m
[34mcondition is not common, with about one in [0m[1;34m1000[0m[34m patients developing renal insufficiency or renal failure. In most cases, proteinuria associated with captopril use subsided or cleared within six [0m
[34mmonths, and renal function parameters were seldom altered in patients with proteinuria.[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. Drug ENALAPRIL MALEATE: ENALAPRIL MALEATE can increase the risk of renal failure, particularly in susceptible individuals such as those with severe heart failure or pre-existing renal impairment. [0m
[34mMonitoring of renal function is recommended during the first few weeks of therapy. This information is based on the response from FDAHandler, which referenced the ENALAPRIL MALEATE label indicating [0m
