                Passages:
                1. Drug LISINOPRIL: Lisinopril can both increase and decrease the risk of renal failure depending on various factors such as the patient's condition and concurrent medications. It can 
lead to deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure in certain populations, such as elderly patients, those who are volume-depleted, or those with compromised renal 
function, especially when co-administered with NSAIDs. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors like lisinopril is associated with an increased risk of changes in renal 
function, including acute renal failure. However, in patients with severe congestive heart failure or with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, treatment with lisinopril may be associated 
with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death, which are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. It is important to 
monitor renal function in patients receiving lisinopril, especially those with pre-existing renal impairment or those on diuretic therapy.
2. Drug CAPTOPRIL: CAPTOPRIL can potentially increase the risk of renal failure in some patients, especially those with pre-existing renal disease or severe renal artery stenosis. However, the 
condition is not common, with about one in 1000 patients developing renal insufficiency or renal failure. In most cases, proteinuria associated with captopril use subsided or cleared within six 
months, and renal function parameters were seldom altered in patients with proteinuria.
3. Drug ENALAPRIL MALEATE: ENALAPRIL MALEATE can increase the risk of renal failure, particularly in susceptible individuals such as those with severe heart failure or pre-existing renal impairment. 
Monitoring of renal function is recommended during the first few weeks of therapy. This information is based on the response from FDAHandler, which referenced the ENALAPRIL MALEATE label indicating 
that changes in renal function associated with the drug may lead to an increased risk of renal failure in certain patients.

                renal failure, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs increase the risk of renal failure, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passages provided indicate that ACE inhibitors, including Lisinopril, Captopril, and Enalapril Maleate, can increase the risk of renal failure, particularly in certain populations such 
as those with pre-existing renal disease, severe heart failure, or renal artery stenosis.
2. However, the risk is not uniform across all patients and can depend on various factors such as the patient's condition, concurrent medications, and whether the patient is volume-depleted or 
elderly.
3. Monitoring of renal function is recommended for patients on ACE inhibitors, and in some cases, the renal issues are reversible upon discontinuation of the drug or diuretic therapy.
4. The evidence suggests that while ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of renal failure in certain populations, the effect is not common and requires monitoring and management of risk factors.
        -----
        Final answer: The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs can increase the risk of renal failure, particularly in susceptible individuals, but the effect is not common and is
often manageable with proper monitoring and discontinuation if necessary.
