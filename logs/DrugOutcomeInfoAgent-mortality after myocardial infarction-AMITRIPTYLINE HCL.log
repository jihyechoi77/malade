[31mCONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: [0m[1;31m8[0m[31m. Overdosage Deaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. Multiple drug ingestion [0m[1;31m([0m[31mincluding alcohol[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m is common in deliberate tricyclic [0m
[31mantidepressant overdose. As the management is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment. Signs and symptoms of [0m
[31mtoxicity develop rapidly after tricyclic antidepressant overdose, therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible. Manifestations Critical manifestations of overdose include: cardiac [0m
[31mdysrhythmias, severe hypotension, convulsions, and CNS depression, including coma. Changes in the electrocardiogram particularly in QRS axis or width, are clinically significant indicators of [0m
[31mtricyclic antidepressant toxicity. In addition, a rightward axis shift in the terminal QRS complex together with a prolonged QT interval and sinus tachycardia are specific and sensitive indicators of [0m
[31mfirst generation tricyclic overdose. The absence of these findings is not exclusionary. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: Prolonged PR interval, ST-T wave changes, ventricular tachycardia and [0m
[31mfibrillation may also occur. Other signs of overdose may include: impaired myocardial contractility, confusion, disturbed concentration, transient visual hallucinations, dilated pupils, disorders of [0m
[31mocular motility, agitation, hyperactive reflexes polyradiculoneuropathy, stupor, drowsiness, muscle rigidity, vomiting, hypothermia, hyperpyrexia, or any of the symptoms listed under ADVERSE [0m
[31mREACTIONS. Management General Obtain an ECG and immediately initiate cardiac monitoring. Protect the patientâ€™s airway, establish an intravenous line and initiate gastric decontamination. A minimum of [0m
[31msix hours of observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or respiratory depression, hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias and/or conduction blocks, and seizures is necessary. If [0m
[31msigns of toxicity occur at any time during the period extended monitoring is required. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: There are case reports of patients succumbing to fatal dysrhythmias late after [0m
[31moverdose; these patients had clinical evidence of significant poisoning prior to death and most received inadequate gastrointestinal decontamination. Monitoring of plasma drug levels should not guide [0m
[31mmanagement of the patient. Gastrointestinal Decontamination All patients suspected of tricyclic antidepressant overdose should receive gastrointestinal decontamination. This should include, large [0m
[31mvolume gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal. If consciousness is impaired, the airway should be secured prior to lavage. EMESIS IS CONTRAINDICATED. Cardiovascular A maximal limb-lead QRS [0m
[31mduration of â‰¥[0m[1;31m0.10[0m[31m seconds may be the best indication of the severity of the overdose. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be used to maintain the serum pH in the range of [0m[1;31m7.45[0m[31m to [0m[1;31m7.55[0m[31m. If the pH [0m
[31mresponse is inadequate, hyperventilation may also be used. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: Concomitant use of hyperventilation and sodium bicarbonate should be done with extreme caution, with frequent [0m
[31mpH monitoring. A pH >[0m[1;31m7.60[0m[31m or a pCO [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m <[0m[1;31m20[0m[31m mm Hg is undesirable.

[31mC antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated [0m[1;31m([0m[31me.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m. In rare instances, hemoperfusion may be beneficial in acute refractory cardiovascular instability in [0m
[31mpatients with acute toxicity. However, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced diuresis generally have been reported as ineffective in tricyclic antidepressant poisoning. [0m
