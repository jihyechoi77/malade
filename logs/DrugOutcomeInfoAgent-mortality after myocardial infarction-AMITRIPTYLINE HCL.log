CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: 8. Overdosage Deaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate tricyclic 
antidepressant overdose. As the management is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment. Signs and symptoms of 
toxicity develop rapidly after tricyclic antidepressant overdose, therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible. Manifestations Critical manifestations of overdose include: cardiac 
dysrhythmias, severe hypotension, convulsions, and CNS depression, including coma. Changes in the electrocardiogram particularly in QRS axis or width, are clinically significant indicators of 
tricyclic antidepressant toxicity. In addition, a rightward axis shift in the terminal QRS complex together with a prolonged QT interval and sinus tachycardia are specific and sensitive indicators of 
first generation tricyclic overdose. The absence of these findings is not exclusionary. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: Prolonged PR interval, ST-T wave changes, ventricular tachycardia and 
fibrillation may also occur. Other signs of overdose may include: impaired myocardial contractility, confusion, disturbed concentration, transient visual hallucinations, dilated pupils, disorders of 
ocular motility, agitation, hyperactive reflexes polyradiculoneuropathy, stupor, drowsiness, muscle rigidity, vomiting, hypothermia, hyperpyrexia, or any of the symptoms listed under ADVERSE 
REACTIONS. Management General Obtain an ECG and immediately initiate cardiac monitoring. Protect the patient’s airway, establish an intravenous line and initiate gastric decontamination. A minimum of 
six hours of observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or respiratory depression, hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias and/or conduction blocks, and seizures is necessary. If 
signs of toxicity occur at any time during the period extended monitoring is required. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: There are case reports of patients succumbing to fatal dysrhythmias late after 
overdose; these patients had clinical evidence of significant poisoning prior to death and most received inadequate gastrointestinal decontamination. Monitoring of plasma drug levels should not guide 
management of the patient. Gastrointestinal Decontamination All patients suspected of tricyclic antidepressant overdose should receive gastrointestinal decontamination. This should include, large 
volume gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal. If consciousness is impaired, the airway should be secured prior to lavage. EMESIS IS CONTRAINDICATED. Cardiovascular A maximal limb-lead QRS 
duration of ≥0.10 seconds may be the best indication of the severity of the overdose. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be used to maintain the serum pH in the range of 7.45 to 7.55. If the pH 
response is inadequate, hyperventilation may also be used. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: overdosage: Concomitant use of hyperventilation and sodium bicarbonate should be done with extreme caution, with frequent 
pH monitoring. A pH >7.60 or a pCO 2 <20 mm Hg is undesirable. Dysrhythmias unresponsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy/hyperventilation may respond to lidocaine, bretylium or phenytoin. Type 1 A and 1
C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyramide, and procainamide). In rare instances, hemoperfusion may be beneficial in acute refractory cardiovascular instability in 
patients with acute toxicity. However, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced diuresis generally have been reported as ineffective in tricyclic antidepressant poisoning. 
CNS In patients with CNS depression early intubation is advised because of the potential for abrupt deterioration.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: contraindications: 4. Contraindications Amitriptyline hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to it. It should not be given 
concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Hyperpyretic crises, severe convulsions, and deaths have occurred in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressant and monoamine oxidase inhibiting drugs
simultaneously. When it is desired to replace a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with amitriptyline hydrochloride, a minimum of 14 days should be allowed to elapse after the former is discontinued. 
Amitriptyline hydrochloride should then be initiated cautiously with gradual increase in dosage until optimum response is achieved. Amitriptyline hydrochloride should not be given with cisapride due 
to the potential for increased QT interval and increased risk for arrhythmia. This drug is not recommended for use during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: adverse_reactions: 7. Adverse Reactions Within each category the following adverse reactions are listed in order of decreasing severity. Included in the listing are a few 
adverse reactions which have not been reported with this specific drug. However, pharmacological similarities among the tricyclic antidepressant drugs require that each of the reactions be considered 
when amitriptyline is administered. Cardiovascular: Myocardial infarction; stroke; nonspecific ECG changes and changes in AV conduction; heart block; arrhythmias; hypotension, particularly orthostatic
hypotension; syncope; hypertension; tachycardia; palpitation. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: adverse_reactions: CNS and Neuromuscular: Coma; seizures; hallucinations; delusions; confusional states; 
disorientation; incoordination; ataxia; tremors; peripheral neuropathy; numbness, tingling and paresthesias of the extremities; extrapyramidal symptoms including abnormal involuntary movements and 
tardive dyskinesia; dysarthria; disturbed concentration; excitement; anxiety; insomnia; restlessness; nightmares; drowsiness; dizziness; weakness; fatigue; headache; syndrome of inappropriate ADH 
(antidiuretic hormone) secretion; tinnitus; alteration in EEG patterns. Anticholinergic: Paralytic ileus, hyperpyrexia; urinary retention, dilatation of the urinary tract; constipation; blurred 
vision, disturbance of accommodation, increased ocular pressure, mydriasis; dry mouth. Allergic: Skin rash; urticaria; photosensitization; edema of face and tongue. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: 
adverse_reactions: Hematologic: Bone marrow depression including agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia; purpura; eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal: Rarely hepatitis (including altered liver 
function and jaundice); nausea; epigastric distress; vomiting; anorexia; stomatitis; peculiar taste; diarrhea; parotid swelling; black tongue. Endocrine: Testicular swelling and gynecomastia in the 
male; breast enlargement and galactorrhea in the female; increased or decreased libido; impotence; elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels. Other: Alopecia; edema; weight gain or loss; urinary 
frequency; increased perspiration. Withdrawal Symptoms After prolonged administration, abrupt cessation of treatment may produce nausea, headache, and malaise. Gradual dosage reduction has been 
reported to produce, within two weeks, transient symptoms including irritability, restlessness, and dream and sleep disturbance.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: boxed_warning: Boxed Warning SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS: Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in
children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of amitriptyline hydrochloride tablets or 
any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with 
antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other 
psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed 
closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: boxed_warning: Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and 
communication with the prescriber. Amitriptyline hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: boxed_warning: (See WARNINGS: CLINICAL WORSENING AND SUICIDE RISK,
