CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: spl_medguide: 13. Medguide Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions Read the Medication Guide that comes 
with you or your family member’s antidepressant medicine. This Medication Guide is only about the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions with antidepressant medicines. Talk to your, or your family 
member’s, healthcare provider about: all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines all treatment choices for depression or other serious mental illness What is the most important 
information I should know about antidepressant medicines, depression and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions? Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts or 
actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and 
actions. Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: spl_medguide: These include people who have (or have a family history of) bipolar 
illness (also called manic-depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions in myself or a family member? Pay close attention 
to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed. Call the healthcare
provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between 
visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: spl_medguide: Call a healthcare provider right away if you or your family member has any of the following symptoms,
especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling very agitated or restless panic attacks
trouble sleeping (insomnia) new or worse irritability acting aggressive, being angry, or violent acting on dangerous impulses an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) other unusual changes 
in behavior or mood What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines? Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant 
medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms. Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the 
risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other caregivers should discuss all treatment choices with the healthcare provider, not just the use of antidepressants.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: 5. Warnings Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their 
depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist 
until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has 
been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of 
treatment. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal 
thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an 
increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The 
pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 
antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 
short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an 
increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk 
differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 
patients treated) are provided in Table 1. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to 
Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case ≥65 6 fewer case No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were 
suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., 
beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of 
depression. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, 
and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, 
agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients
being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms 
and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. 
AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or 
who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the
patient’s presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be
alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, 
and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for amitriptyline hydrochloride should be 
written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A 
major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an 
antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a 
conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar 
disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that amitriptyline hydrochloride is 
not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Amitriptyline hydrochloride may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or similarly acting compounds. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: It 
should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures and, because of its atropine-like action, in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma or increased 
intraocular pressure. In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, even average doses may precipitate an attack. Patients with cardiovascular disorders should be watched closely. Tricyclic antidepressant 
drugs, including amitriptyline hydrochloride, particularly when given in high doses, have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, and prolongation of the conduction time. Myocardial 
infarction and stroke have been reported with drugs of this class. Close supervision is required when amitriptyline hydrochloride is given to hyperthyroid patients or those receiving thyroid 
medication. Amitriptyline may enhance the response to alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it 
should be borne in mind that the potentiation may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage. Delirium has been reported with concurrent administration of amitriptyline and 
disulfiram. Usage in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Teratogenic effects were not observed in mice, rats, or rabbits when amitriptyline was given orally at doses of 2 to 40 mg/kg/day (up to 13 times 
the maximum recommended human dose 1). Studies in literature have shown amitriptyline to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given by various routes of administration at doses of 28 to 100 
mg/kg/day (9 to 33 times the maximum recommended human dose), producing multiple malformations. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Another study in the rat reported that an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day (8 
times the maximum recommended human dose) produced delays in ossification of fetal vertebral bodies without other signs of embryotoxicity. In rabbits, an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (20 times the 
maximum recommended human dose) was reported to cause incomplete ossification of cranial bones. Amitriptyline has been shown to cross the placenta. Although a causal relationship has not been 
established, there have been a few reports of adverse events, including CNS effects, limb deformities, or developmental delay, in infants whose mothers had taken amitriptyline during pregnancy. There 
are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Amitriptyline hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to 
the fetus.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: 6. Precautions Schizophrenic patients may develop increased symptoms of psychosis; patients with paranoid symptomatology may have an exaggeration of such 
symptoms. Depressed patients, particularly those with known manic-depressive illness, may experience a shift to mania or hypomania. In these circumstances the dose of amitriptyline may be reduced or a
major tranquilizer such as perphenazine may be administered concurrently. The possibility of suicide in depressed patients remains until significant remission occurs. Potentially suicidal patients 
should not have access to large quantities of this drug. Prescriptions should be written for the smallest amount feasible. Concurrent administration of amitriptyline hydrochloride and electroshock 
therapy may increase the hazards associated with such therapy. Such treatment should be limited to patients for whom it is essential. When possible, the drug should be discontinued several days before
elective surgery. Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Amitriptyline hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with 
impaired liver function. Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with 
treatment with amitriptyline hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illnesses, 
and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions” is available for amitriptyline hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the 
Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions 
they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert
their prescriber if these occur while taking amitriptyline hydrochloride. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the 
emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in 
behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be 
advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient’s prescriber or health professional, especially 
if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal
thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. While on therapy with amitriptyline hydrochloride, patients should be advised as to the 
possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Drug Interactions Topiramate Some patients 
may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate and any adjustments in amitriptyline dose should be made according to the patient's clinical response and 
not on the basis of plasma levels. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase)
is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population (about 7 to 10% of Caucasians are so called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among 
Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on 
the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA). In addition, certain drugs inhibit the 
activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when 
given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are 
substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., 
fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of 
inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: contraindications: 4. Contraindications Amitriptyline hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to it. It should not be given 
concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Hyperpyretic crises, severe convulsions, and deaths have occurred in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressant and monoamine oxidase inhibiting drugs
simultaneously. When it is desired to replace a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with amitriptyline hydrochloride, a minimum of 14 days should be allowed to elapse after the former is discontinued. 
Amitriptyline hydrochloride should then be initiated cautiously with gradual increase in dosage until optimum response is achieved. Amitriptyline hydrochloride should not be given with cisapride due 
to the potential for increased QT interval and increased risk for arrhythmia. This drug is not recommended for use during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction.

rarely reported after starting or increasing the dose of amitriptyline hydrochloride, with and without concomitant medications known to cause NMS. Symptoms have included muscle rigidity, fever, mental
status changes, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and tremor. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: adverse_reactions: Very rare cases of serotonin syndrome (SS) have been reported with amitriptyline hydrochloride in 
combination with other drugs that have a recognized association with SS.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: 5. Warnings Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their 
depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist 
until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has 
been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of 
treatment. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal 
thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an 
increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The 
pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 
antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 
short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an 
increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk 
differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 
patients treated) are provided in Table 1. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to 
Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18 to 24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 1 fewer case ≥65 6 fewer case No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were 
suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., 
beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of 
depression. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, 
and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, 
agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients
being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms 
and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. 
AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or 
who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the
patient’s presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be
alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, 
and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for amitriptyline hydrochloride should be 
written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A 
major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an 
antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a 
conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar 
disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that amitriptyline hydrochloride is 
not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Amitriptyline hydrochloride may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or similarly acting compounds. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: It 
should be used with caution in patients with a history of seizures and, because of its atropine-like action, in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma or increased 
intraocular pressure. In patients with angle-closure glaucoma, even average doses may precipitate an attack. Patients with cardiovascular disorders should be watched closely. Tricyclic antidepressant 
drugs, including amitriptyline hydrochloride, particularly when given in high doses, have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, and prolongation of the conduction time. Myocardial 
infarction and stroke have been reported with drugs of this class. Close supervision is required when amitriptyline hydrochloride is given to hyperthyroid patients or those receiving thyroid 
medication. Amitriptyline may enhance the response to alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it 
should be borne in mind that the potentiation may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage. Delirium has been reported with concurrent administration of amitriptyline and 
disulfiram. Usage in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Teratogenic effects were not observed in mice, rats, or rabbits when amitriptyline was given orally at doses of 2 to 40 mg/kg/day (up to 13 times 
the maximum recommended human dose 1). Studies in literature have shown amitriptyline to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given by various routes of administration at doses of 28 to 100 
mg/kg/day (9 to 33 times the maximum recommended human dose), producing multiple malformations. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Another study in the rat reported that an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day (8 
times the maximum recommended human dose) produced delays in ossification of fetal vertebral bodies without other signs of embryotoxicity. In rabbits, an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (20 times the 
maximum recommended human dose) was reported to cause incomplete ossification of cranial bones. Amitriptyline has been shown to cross the placenta. Although a causal relationship has not been 
established, there have been a few reports of adverse events, including CNS effects, limb deformities, or developmental delay, in infants whose mothers had taken amitriptyline during pregnancy. There 
are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Amitriptyline hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to 
the fetus.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: 6. Precautions Schizophrenic patients may develop increased symptoms of psychosis; patients with paranoid symptomatology may have an exaggeration of such 
symptoms. Depressed patients, particularly those with known manic-depressive illness, may experience a shift to mania or hypomania. In these circumstances the dose of amitriptyline may be reduced or a
major tranquilizer such as perphenazine may be administered concurrently. The possibility of suicide in depressed patients remains until significant remission occurs. Potentially suicidal patients 
should not have access to large quantities of this drug. Prescriptions should be written for the smallest amount feasible. Concurrent administration of amitriptyline hydrochloride and electroshock 
therapy may increase the hazards associated with such therapy. Such treatment should be limited to patients for whom it is essential. When possible, the drug should be discontinued several days before
elective surgery. Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Amitriptyline hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with 
impaired liver function. Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with 
treatment with amitriptyline hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illnesses, 
and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions” is available for amitriptyline hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the 
Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions 
they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert
their prescriber if these occur while taking amitriptyline hydrochloride. Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the 
emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in 
behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be 
advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient’s prescriber or health professional, especially 
if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal
thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. While on therapy with amitriptyline hydrochloride, patients should be advised as to the 
possible impairment of mental and/or physical abilities required for performance of hazardous tasks, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Drug Interactions Topiramate Some patients 
may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate and any adjustments in amitriptyline dose should be made according to the patient's clinical response and 
not on the basis of plasma levels. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase)
is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population (about 7 to 10% of Caucasians are so called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among 
Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on 
the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA). In addition, certain drugs inhibit the 
activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: precautions: An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when 
given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are 
substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., 
fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of 
inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved.

CONTENT: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: contraindications: 4. Contraindications Amitriptyline hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients who have shown prior hypersensitivity to it. It should not be given 
concomitantly with monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Hyperpyretic crises, severe convulsions, and deaths have occurred in patients receiving tricyclic antidepressant and monoamine oxidase inhibiting drugs
simultaneously. When it is desired to replace a monoamine oxidase inhibitor with amitriptyline hydrochloride, a minimum of 14 days should be allowed to elapse after the former is discontinued. 
Amitriptyline hydrochloride should then be initiated cautiously with gradual increase in dosage until optimum response is achieved. Amitriptyline hydrochloride should not be given with cisapride due 
to the potential for increased QT interval and increased risk for arrhythmia. This drug is not recommended for use during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction.

about whether AMITRIPTYLINE HCL increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. This indicates that the FDA label for AMITRIPTYLINE HCL does not specify any information regarding its effects on 
renal failure risk. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, we cannot determine if AMITRIPTYLINE HCL has any impact on the risk of renal failure.

Since multiple attempts to retrieve relevant information from the FDA label data have failed, we must conclude that the information is not available in the FDA labels, and thus the FDAHandler cannot 
answer the question. 

<DONE> DO-NOT-KNOW

The justification for this conclusion is that the FDA label for AMITRIPTYLINE HCL does not contain information about the drug's effect on renal failure risk, as indicated by the "DO-NOT-KNOW" 
responses from FDAHandler to both inquiries about an increase and a decrease in risk.
