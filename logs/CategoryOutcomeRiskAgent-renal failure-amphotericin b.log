                Passages:
                1. Drug AMBISOME: AMBISOME has been associated with an increased risk of renal failure, including acute kidney failure and toxic nephropathy. However, it appears to have a lower 
incidence of nephrotoxicity compared to other formulations of amphotericin B.
2. Drug AMPHOTERICIN B: AMPHOTERICIN B increases the risk of renal failure, with 'Increased Serum Creatinine' reported in 11% of patients and 'Kidney Failure' in 5% of patients, although the causal 
relationship is uncertain.
3. Drug ABELCET: ABELCET has been associated with an increased risk of renal failure, as indicated by reports of increased serum creatinine in 11% of patients and kidney failure as an adverse event 
with an incidence of 5% in clinical studies. However, it is important to note that the causal relationship between ABELCET and these adverse events is not definitively established.

                Does the amphotericin b category of drugs increase the risk of
                renal failure, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the amphotericin b category of drugs increase the risk of renal failure, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. All three passages about different formulations of amphotericin B (AMBISOME, AMPHOTERICIN B, and ABELCET) indicate an association with an increased risk of renal failure.
2. Passage 1 states that AMBISOME is associated with an increased risk of renal failure but has a lower incidence of nephrotoxicity compared to other formulations.
3. Passage 2 reports that AMPHOTERICIN B increases the risk of renal failure, with specific statistics on the incidence of 'Increased Serum Creatinine' and 'Kidney Failure'.
4. Passage 3 indicates that ABELCET is associated with an increased risk of renal failure, with similar statistics to those provided for AMPHOTERICIN B.
5. While the causal relationship is not definitively established, the consistent reporting of increased risk across multiple sources suggests that the amphotericin B category of drugs does increase 
the risk of renal failure.

        Final answer: increase
