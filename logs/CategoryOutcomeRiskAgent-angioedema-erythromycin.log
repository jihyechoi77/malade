                Passages:
                1. Drug ERYTHROMYCIN: ERYTHROMYCIN can potentially increase the risk of angioedema. This is based on information from the FDAHandler, which indicates that ERYTHROMYCIN has been 
associated with generalized urticarial reactions that can include angioedema and have required systemic steroid therapy.
2. Drug ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: The FDA label for ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE does not specifically mention an increased risk of angioedema, but it does list allergic reactions as side effects, 
which could potentially include angioedema. Therefore, while angioedema is not explicitly listed, it may be a possible side effect within the spectrum of allergic reactions to the drug.
3. Drug ERYTHROMYCIN: The final answer to the question "Does ERYTHROMYCIN increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?" is that the ERYTHROMYCIN label does not explicitly mention an increased risk of 
angioedema. However, it does report generalized urticarial reactions, which can be associated with angioedema. The degree of risk or causality is not confirmed by the label.

                Does the erythromycin category of drugs increase the risk of
                angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the erythromycin category of drugs increase the risk of angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 states that ERYTHROMYCIN can potentially increase the risk of angioedema, based on FDAHandler information indicating an association with generalized urticarial reactions that can 
include angioedema.
2. Passage 2 indicates that while the FDA label for ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE does not specifically mention an increased risk of angioedema, it lists allergic reactions as side effects, which could 
potentially include angioedema.
3. Passage 3 reiterates that the ERYTHROMYCIN label does not explicitly mention an increased risk of angioedema but does report generalized urticarial reactions, which can be associated with 
angioedema.
4. The information provided suggests that there is a potential for erythromycin and its derivatives to increase the risk of angioedema, although the degree of risk or causality is not confirmed by the
labels.
        -----
        Final answer: The erythromycin category of drugs potentially increases the risk of angioedema.
