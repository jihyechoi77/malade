CONTENT: AMBISOME: clinical_studies: The following table presents a comparison of efficacy rates among immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients infected in the Mediterranean basin who had no 
prior treatment or remote prior treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. Efficacy is expressed as both acute parasite clearance at the end of therapy (EOT) and as overall success (clearance with no 
relapse) during the follow-up period (F/U) of greater than 6 months for immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients: AmBisome Efficacy in Visceral Leishmaniasis Immunocompetent Patients No. of 
Patients Parasite (%) Clearance at EOT Overall Success (%) at F/U 87 86/87 (98.9) 83/86 (96.5) Immunocompromised Patients Regimen Total Dose Parasite (%) Clearance at EOT Overall Success (%) at F/U

followed for 6 months or more after treatment, the overall success rate among immunocompetent patients was 96.5% and the overall success rate among immunocompromised patients was 11.8% due to relapse 
in the majority of patients. While case reports have suggested there may be a role for long-term therapy to prevent relapses in HIV coinfected patients (Lopez-Dupla, et al. AMBISOME: clinical_studies:
J Antimicrob Chemother 1993; 32: 657-659), there are no data to date documenting the efficacy or safety of repeat courses of Am B isome or of maintenance therapy with this drug among immunocompromised
patients.

CONTENT: AMBISOME: precautions: Skeletal Muscle Relaxants Amphotericin B-induced hypokalemia may enhance the curariform effect of skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g. tubocurarine) due to hypokalemia. When
administered concomitantly, serum potassium levels should be closely monitored. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate 
carcinogenic potential of Am B isome. Am B isome has not been tested to determine its mutagenic potential. A Segment I Reproductive Study in rats found an abnormal estrous cycle (prolonged diestrus) 
and decreased number of corpora lutea in the high-dose groups (10 and 15 mg/kg, doses equivalent to human doses of 1.6 and 2.4 mg/kg based on body surface area considerations). Am B isome did not 
affect fertility or days to copulation. AMBISOME: precautions: There were no effects on male reproductive function. Pregnancy There have been no adequate and well-controlled studies of Am B isome in 
pregnant women. Systemic fungal infections have been successfully treated in pregnant women with amphotericin B deoxycholate, but the number of cases reported has been small. Segment II studies in 
both rats and rabbits have concluded that Am B isome had no teratogenic potential in these species. In rats, the maternal non-toxic dose of Am B isome was estimated to be 5 mg/kg (equivalent to 0.16 
to 0.8 times the recommended human clinical dose range of 1 to 5 mg/kg) and in rabbits, 3 mg/kg (equivalent to 0.2 to 1 times the recommended human clinical dose range), based on body surface area 
correction. Rabbits receiving the higher doses, (equivalent to 0. AMBISOME: precautions: 5 to 2 times the recommended human dose) of Am B isome experienced a higher rate of spontaneous abortions than 
did the control groups. Am B isome should only be used during pregnancy if the possible benefits to be derived outweigh the potential risks involved. Nursing Mothers Many drugs are excreted in human 
milk; however, it is not known whether Am B isome is excreted in human milk. Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue 
nursing or whether to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Pediatric patients, age 1 month to 16 years, with presumed fungal infection 
(empirical therapy), confirmed systemic fungal infections or with visceral leishmaniasis have been successfully treated with Am B isome. AMBISOME: precautions: In studies which included 302 pediatric 
patients administered Am B isome, there was no evidence of any differences in efficacy or safety of Am B isome compared to adults. Since pediatric patients have received Am B isome at doses comparable
to those used in adults on a per kilogram body weight basis, no dosage adjustment is required in this population. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of one month have not 
been established (See DESCRIPTION OF CLINICAL STUDIES - Empirical Therapy in Febrile Neutropenic Patients and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Elderly Patients Experience with Am B isome in the elderly 
(65 years or older) comprised 72 patients. It has not been necessary to alter the dose of Am B isome for this population. As with most other drugs, elderly patients receiving Am B isome should be 
carefully monitored.

deoxycholate as initial therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, premedications to prevent infusion-related reactions were permitted. Am B isome-treated patients had a lower incidence of fever,

reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with Am B isome administration; on occasion this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the 
reaction developed within a few minutes after the start of infusion and disappeared rapidly when the infusion was stopped. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: The symptoms do not occur with every dose and 
usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse

ANSWER: AMBISOME has been reported to cause thrombocytopenia, which is a condition that can increase the risk of bleeding due to a reduced number of platelets in the blood. Additionally, hemorrhage is
listed as a cardiovascular adverse event, and gum/oral hemorrhage is listed under digestive system adverse events. These findings suggest that AMBISOME may increase the risk of bleeding.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.
2. FDAHandler reported that AMBISOME has been associated with thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding due to a reduced number of platelets. Additionally, hemorrhage is listed as a 
cardiovascular adverse event, and gum/oral hemorrhage is listed under digestive system adverse events in the AMBISOME label.

AMBISOME may increase the risk of bleeding due to its association with thrombocytopenia and the listing of hemorrhage as an adverse event. This information is based on the AMBISOME label, which 
reports thrombocytopenia as a condition that can increase the risk of bleeding and lists hemorrhage as a cardiovascular adverse event and gum/oral hemorrhage under digestive system adverse events.
