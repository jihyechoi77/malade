                Passages:
                1. Drug METOPROLOL TARTRATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for METOPROLOL TARTRATE does not indicate that the drug increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. The adverse reactions table and other sections of the label do not mention renal
failure as a known adverse effect or precaution. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to determine if METOPROLOL TARTRATE has an effect on the risk of renal failure.
2. Drug LABETALOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether LABETALOL increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. After consulting with FDAHandler, the response indicated that the LABETALOL label does not specifically mention an 
increase or decrease in the risk of renal failure. However, it is noted that doses of labetalol that controlled hypertension did not affect renal function in patients with normal renal function. This 
information suggests that in the context of hypertension control, labetalol does not adversely affect renal function in patients with normal renal function. Nonetheless, the label advises monitoring 
conditions such as impaired renal function in patients with concomitant illnesses. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to definitively state whether LABETALOL 
increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
3. Drug ATENOLOL: Atenolol has been reported to increase the risk of renal failure, but this occurs at a very low frequency of 0.4% according to the drug label.

                Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of
                renal failure, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for METOPROLOL TARTRATE does not indicate any known effect on the risk of renal failure.
2. The FDA label for LABETALOL does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of renal failure, but suggests that it does not adversely affect renal function in patients with normal
renal function when used for hypertension control.
3. The drug label for ATENOLOL reports an increased risk of renal failure, but at a very low frequency of 0.4%.
4. Given that two out of three drugs have no clear evidence of an effect on renal failure risk and one drug has a very low frequency of increased risk, it is not possible to conclude that the beta 
blocker category as a whole has a clear effect on the risk of renal failure.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the beta blocker category of drugs on the risk of renal failure.
