CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Enalapril, after hydrolysis to enalaprilat, inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects 
and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the 
adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of enalapril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Inhibition of ACE results
in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. Although the latter decrease is small, it results in small increases of serum 
potassium. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: mechanism_of_action: In hypertensive patients treated with enalapril maleate alone for up to 48 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of approximately 0.2 mEq/L were 
observed. In patients treated with enalapril maleate plus a thiazide diuretic, there was essentially no change in serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS ). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on 
renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity. ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play
a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril maleate remains to be elucidated. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: While the mechanism through which enalapril maleate lowers blood pressure is 
believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, enalapril maleate is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although enalapril maleate was 
antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to enalapril monotherapy than non-black patients. 
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration of enalapril maleate, peak serum concentrations of enalapril occur within about one hour. Based on urinary recovery, the extent of 
absorption of enalapril is approximately 60 percent. Enalapril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: Following 
absorption, enalapril is hydrolyzed to enalaprilat, which is a more potent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor than enalapril; enalaprilat is poorly absorbed when administered orally. Peak serum 
concentrations of enalaprilat occur three to four hours after an oral dose of enalapril maleate. Excretion of enalapril maleate is primarily renal. Approximately 94 percent of the dose is recovered in
the urine and feces as enalaprilat or enalapril. The principal components in urine are enalaprilat, accounting for about 40 percent of the dose, and intact enalapril. There is no evidence of 
metabolites of enalapril, other than enalaprilat. The serum concentration profile of enalaprilat exhibits a prolonged terminal phase, apparently representing a small fraction of the administered dose 
that has been bound to ACE. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: The amount bound does not increase with dose, indicating a saturable site of binding. The effective half-life for accumulation of 
enalaprilat following multiple doses of enalapril maleate is 11 hours. The disposition of enalapril and enalaprilat in patients with renal insufficiency is similar to that in patients with normal 
renal function until the glomerular filtration rate is 30 mL/min or less. With glomerular filtration rate ≤ 30 mL/min, peak and trough enalaprilat levels increase, time to peak concentration increases
and time to steady state may be delayed. The effective half-life of enalaprilat following multiple doses of enalapril maleate is prolonged at this level of renal insufficiency (see DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION ). Enalaprilat is dialyzable at the rate of 62 mL/min. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: mechanism_of_action: Mechanism of Action Enalapril, after hydrolysis to enalaprilat, inhibits 
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. 
Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. The beneficial effects of enalapril in hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are
effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate and thiazides are approximately 
additive. Heart Failure Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients 
enalapril maleate improves symptoms, increases survival, and decreases the frequency of hospitalization (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of 
survival trials). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 
≤35 percent), enalapril maleate tablets, USP decreases the rate of development of overt heart failure and decreases the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart
Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of survival trials). In using enalapril maleate, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 
captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that enalapril maleate does not 
have a similar risk (see WARNINGS , Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: In considering use of enalapril maleate, it should be noted that in controlled clinical 
trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, it should be noted that black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been 
reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ).

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and 
polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including enalapril maleate) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck 
Angioedema Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril maleate. 
This may occur at any time during treatment. In such cases enalapril maleate should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained 
resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: In instances where swelling has been confined to the face and lips the condition has generally resolved without treatment, 
although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause 
airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway, should be promptly provided (see ADVERSE
REACTIONS ). Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may 
be at increased risk for angioedema (see PRECAUTIONS ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These 
patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was 
diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential 
diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving 
an ACE inhibitor (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while 
receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions.

Findings Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia (see PRECAUTIONS, Hyperkalemia ), hyponatremia. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen In controlled clinical trials minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum 
creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of therapy, were observed in about 0.2 percent of patients with essential hypertension treated with enalapril maleate alone. Increases are more likely to 
occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics or in patients with renal artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS, Impaired Renal Function ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: In patients with heart 
failure who were also receiving diuretics with or without digitalis, increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine, usually reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril maleate and/or other 
concomitant diuretic therapy, were observed in about 11 percent of patients. Increases in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine were a cause for discontinuation in 1.2 percent of patients. Hematology 
Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.3 g percent and 1 vol percent, respectively) occur frequently in either hypertension or congestive heart failure 
patients treated with enalapril maleate but are rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexists. In clinical trials, less than 0.1 percent of patients discontinued therapy due to
anemia. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: Hemolytic anemia, including cases of hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency, has been reported; a causal relationship to enalapril cannot be excluded.

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: dosage_and_administration: For patients with creatinine clearance less than or equal to 30 mL/min (serum creatinine more than or equal to 3 mg/dL), the first dose is 2.5 mg
once daily. The dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure is controlled or to a maximum of 40 mg daily. Renal Status Creatinine Clearance mL/min Initial Dose mg/day Normal Renal Function >80 
mL/min 5 mg Mild Impairment ≤80 >30 mL/min 5 mg Moderate to Severe Impairment ≤30 mL/min 2.5 mg Dialysis Patients See WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure. 2.5 mg on dialysis 
days Dosage on nondialysis days should be adjusted depending on the blood pressure response. Heart Failure Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic heart failure, 
usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: dosage_and_administration: In the placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated improved survival, patients were titrated as 
tolerated up to 40 mg, administered in two divided doses. The recommended initial dose is 2.5 mg. The recommended dosing range is 2.5 to 20 mg given twice a day. Doses should be titrated upward, as 
tolerated, over a period of a few days or weeks. The maximum daily dose administered in clinical trials was 40 mg in divided doses. After the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets USP, the patient
should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). If 
possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: dosage_and_administration: The appearance of hypotension after the
initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets, USP does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective management of the hypotension. Asymptomatic Left Ventricular 
Dysfunction In the trial that demonstrated efficacy, patients were started on 2.5 mg twice daily and were titrated as tolerated to the targeted daily dose of 20 mg (in divided doses). After the 
initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets USP, the patient should be observed under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour 
(see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). If possible, the dose of any concomitant diuretic should be reduced which may diminish the likelihood of hypotension. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: 
dosage_and_administration: The appearance of hypotension after the initial dose of enalapril maleate tablets, USP does not preclude subsequent careful dose titration with the drug, following effective
management of the hypotension. Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Heart Failure and Renal Impairment or Hyponatremia In patients with heart failure who have hyponatremia (serum sodium less than 130 
mEq/L) or with serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dL, therapy should be initiated at 2.5 mg daily under close medical supervision (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Heart Failure , WARNINGS and 
PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). The dose may be increased to 2.5 mg b.i.d., then 5 mg b.i.d. and higher as needed, usually at intervals of four days or more if at the time of dosage adjustment there
is not excessive hypotension or significant deterioration of renal function. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: dosage_and_administration: The maximum daily dose is 40 mg. Pediatric Hypertensive Patients The usual 
recommended starting dose is 0.08 mg/kg (up to 5 mg) once daily. Dosage should be adjusted according to blood pressure response. Doses above 0.58 mg/kg (or in excess of 40 mg) have not been studied in
pediatric patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Pharmacology in Pediatric Patients ). Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are not recommended in neonates and in pediatric patients with glomerular 
filtration rate less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , as no data are available.

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: SURVIVAL (%) Six Months One Year Enalapril Maleate (n=127) 74 64 Placebo (n=126) 56 48 In both CONSENSUS and SOLVD-Treatment trials, patients were 
also usually receiving digitalis, diuretics or both. Clinical Pharmacology in Pediatric Patients A multiple dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 40 hypertensive male and female pediatric 
patients aged 2 months to ≤16 years following daily oral administration of 0.07 to 0.14 mg/kg enalapril maleate. At steady state, the mean effective half-life for accumulation of enalaprilat was 14 
hours, and the mean urinary recovery of total enalapril and enalaprilat in 24 hours was 68 percent of the administered dose. Conversion of enalapril to enalaprilat was in the range of 63 to 76 
percent. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: The overall results of this study indicate that the pharmacokinetics of enalapril in hypertensive children aged 2 months to ≤16 years are consistent 
across the studied age groups and consistent with pharmacokinetic historic data in healthy adults. In a clinical study involving 110 hypertensive pediatric patients 6 to 16 years of age, patients who 
weighed <50 kg received either 0.625, 2.5 or 20 mg of enalapril daily and patients who weighed ≥50 kg received either 1.25, 5, or 40 mg of enalapril daily. Enalapril administered once daily lowered 
trough blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The dose-dependent antihypertensive efficacy of enalapril was consistent across all subgroups (age, Tanner stage, gender, race). However, the lowest 
doses studied, 0.625 mg and 1.25 mg, corresponding to an average of 0. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: 02 mg/kg once daily, did not appear to offer consistent antihypertensive efficacy. In 
this study, enalapril maleate was generally well tolerated. In the above pediatric studies, enalapril maleate was given as tablets of enalapril maleate and for those children and infants who were 
unable to swallow tablets or who required a lower dose than is available in tablet form, enalapril was administered in a suspension formulation (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Preparation of 
Suspension ).

ANSWER: Enalapril Maleate is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension and symptomatic congestive heart failure, often in combination with other 
medications such as diuretics and digitalis. It works by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II, leading to decreased vasopressor activity and aldosterone 
secretion. This results in the suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is the mechanism through which it lowers blood pressure and benefits heart failure patients. Enalapril 
Maleate is also indicated for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to decrease the rate of development of overt heart failure and the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure. The drug is 
generally well tolerated but can cause adverse reactions such as hyperkalemia, hypotension, cough, and angioedema, among others. It is available in tablet form and has a bioactive metabolite called 
enalaprilat.

        Question: Does ENALAPRIL MALEATE increase or decrease the risk of myocardial infarction?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler about the effects of ENALAPRIL MALEATE.
2. FDAHandler provided information on the clinical pharmacology of ENALAPRIL MALEATE, indicating its use in the treatment of hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, and asymptomatic left 
ventricular dysfunction. It works by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which can lower blood pressure and benefit heart failure patients.
3. The FDAHandler response did not directly address the risk of myocardial infarction associated with ENALAPRIL MALEATE.
        -----
        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDAHandler provided information on the clinical pharmacology of ENALAPRIL MALEATE, indicating its use in the treatment of hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, and asymptomatic left 
ventricular dysfunction. It works by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which can lower blood pressure and benefit heart failure patients. However, the FDAHandler response did not 
directly address the risk of myocardial infarction associated with ENALAPRIL MALEATE. Therefore, based on the information provided, we do not know whether ENALAPRIL MALEATE increases or decreases the 
risk of myocardial infarction.
