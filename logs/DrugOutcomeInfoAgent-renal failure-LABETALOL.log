[32mThe question was whether LABETALOL increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. After consulting with FDAHandler, the response indicated that the LABETALOL label does not specifically mention an [0m
[32mincrease or decrease in the risk of renal failure. However, it is noted that doses of labetalol that controlled hypertension did not affect renal function in patients with normal renal function. This [0m
[32minformation suggests that in the context of hypertension control, labetalol does not adversely affect renal function in patients with normal renal function. Nonetheless, the label advises monitoring [0m
[32mconditions such as impaired renal function in patients with concomitant illnesses. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to definitively state whether LABETALOL [0m
[32mincreases or decreases the risk of renal failure.[0m
