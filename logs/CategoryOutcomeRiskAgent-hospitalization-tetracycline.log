[34mThe question regarding whether Doxycycline Hyclate increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization is not one that can be answered with the information available from FDA label data. The FDA label [0m
[34mfor a medication typically includes information on the indications for use, dosing, contraindications, warnings, precautions, adverse reactions, and other relevant clinical information. However, it [0m
[34mdoes not typically provide direct information on the risk of hospitalization as a general outcome. Hospitalization can be a result of various factors, including the severity of the condition being [0m
