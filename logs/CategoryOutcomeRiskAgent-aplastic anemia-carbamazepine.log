                Passages:
                1. Drug CARBAMAZEPINE: CARBAMAZEPINE increases the risk of aplastic anemia. According to data from a population-based case-control study, the risk of developing aplastic anemia is 5 to
8 times greater in patients taking CARBAMAZEPINE than in the general population. However, it's important to note that the overall risk of aplastic anemia in the untreated general population is quite 
low, at approximately two cases per one million people per year.
                ---------
                Does the carbamazepine category of drugs increase the risk of
                aplastic anemia, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the carbamazepine category of drugs increase the risk of aplastic anemia, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. According to the passage, CARBAMAZEPINE, which belongs to the carbamazepine category of drugs, increases the risk of aplastic anemia.
2. The data from a population-based case-control study indicates that the risk of developing aplastic anemia is 5 to 8 times greater in patients taking CARBAMAZEPINE than in the general population.
3. Although the overall risk of aplastic anemia in the untreated general population is low, the increased relative risk associated with CARBAMAZEPINE is significant.
        -----
        Final answer: The carbamazepine category of drugs increases the risk of aplastic anemia.
