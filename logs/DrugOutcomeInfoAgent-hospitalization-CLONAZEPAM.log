[32mThe FDA label for CLONAZEPAM does not directly state that it increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. However, it does warn about several serious risks associated with its use that could [0m
[32mpotentially lead to hospitalization if not managed properly, such as life-threatening withdrawal reactions, increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior, profound sedation, respiratory depression, [0m
[32mcoma, and death when used with opioids, and the potential for abuse, misuse, and addiction which can lead to overdose or death. Therefore, while there is no direct correlation mentioned, there is an [0m
[32mimplication that the risk of hospitalization could be increased due to these serious risks if they are not appropriately managed.[0m
