problems (respiratory depression), coma and death. Get emergency help right away if any of the following happens: o Shallow or slowed breathing, o Breathing stops (which may lead to the heart 
stopping), o Excessive sleepiness (sedation). Do not drive or operate heavy machinery until you know how taking diazepam tablets with opioids affect you. • Risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction. 
DIAZEPAM: spl_medguide: There is a risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction with benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, which can lead to overdose and serious side effects including coma and death. 
o Serious side effects including coma and death have happened in people who have abused or misused benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets. These serious side effects may also include delirium, 
paranoia, suicidal thoughts or actions, seizures, and difficulty breathing. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these serious side 
effects. o You can develop an addiction even if you take diazepam tablets exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. o Take diazepam tablets exactly as your healthcare provider prescribed. o

effects, including, unusual movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an 
extreme increase in activity or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get

withdrawal symptoms (jitteriness, irritability, restlessness, shaking, excessive crying, feeding problems). o Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you are pregnant 
during treatment with diazepam tablets. o There is a pregnancy registry for women who take diazepam tablets during pregnancy. DIAZEPAM: spl_medguide: The purpose of the registry is to collect

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Advise 
both patients and caregivers about the risks of potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation when diazepam tablets are used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless 
supervised by a health care provider. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see WARNINGS: Risks from 
Concomitant Use with Opioids and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction Inform patients that the use of diazepam tablets, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of
abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances. DIAZEPAM: 
information_for_patients: Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the 
proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ). Withdrawal Reactions Inform patients that the continued use of diazepam tablets may lead to 
clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of diazepam tablets may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. 
Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients 
that discontinuation or dosage reduction of diazepam tablets may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ). DIAZEPAM: 
information_for_patients: Patients should be advised against the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS-depressant drugs during diazepam tablets therapy. As is true of most CNS-acting drugs, 
patients receiving diazepam tablets should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Pregnancy
Advise pregnant females that use of diazepam tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, 
restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Instruct patients to inform 
their healthcare provider if they are pregnant. Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to diazepam tablets during pregnancy (see 
Precautions , Pregnancy ). DIAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Nursing Advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with diazepam tablets (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ).

ANSWER: Diazepam is a benzodiazepine medicine used to treat anxiety disorders, provide short-term relief of anxiety symptoms, alleviate symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, relieve muscle spasms in 
conjunction with other medicines, and treat seizure disorders. It is a controlled substance due to the risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and serious side effects 
including coma and death. Diazepam can cause physical dependence and withdrawal reactions. It should not be taken with opioids, alcohol, or other CNS depressants as it can cause severe drowsiness, 
respiratory depression, coma, and death. Common side effects include drowsiness, muscle weakness, loss of control of body movements (ataxia), and fatigue. It is not recommended for use in children 
under 6 months of age or for longer than 4 months. Diazepam should be stored at room temperature in a tightly closed container and kept out of reach of children.

common side effects of Diazepam, but it does not specifically mention renal failure. Since the FDA label data provided does not specify whether Diazepam increases or decreases the risk of renal 
failure, I must answer with DO-NOT-KNOW.

The lack of mention in the FDA label suggests that there may not be a well-established or recognized effect of Diazepam on the risk of renal failure, but it does not rule out the possibility of such 
an effect. It is important to note that the absence of information in the label does not confirm the absence of any potential risk; it simply indicates that the FDA label for Diazepam does not contain
information regarding its impact on renal failure. Therefore, without specific data from the FDA label, we cannot determine the effect of Diazepam on the risk of renal failure.

        Do one of the following:

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.

        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
