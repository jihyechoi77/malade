[32mJustification:[0m
[32mI attempted to obtain information from FDAHandler regarding the effect of phenytoin on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. However, it seems that there was an issue with the [0m
[32mcommunication, and I was unable to receive the necessary data to provide an informed answer. Without specific information from FDA label data, I cannot determine whether phenytoin increases or [0m
[32mdecreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, my final answer is that I do not know.[0m
