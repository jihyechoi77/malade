CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: Although amphotericin B is excreted slowly, there is little accumulation in the blood after repeated dosing. AUC of amphotericin B increased 
approximately 34% from day 1 after the administration of ABELCET ® 5 mg/kg/day for 7 days. The effect of gender or ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of ABELCET ® has not been studied. Tissue 
concentrations of amphotericin B have been obtained at autopsy from one heart transplant patient who received three doses of ABELCET ® at 5.3 mg/kg/day: Concentration in Human Tissues Organ 
Amphotericin B Tissue Concentration (µg/g) Spleen 290.0 Lung 222.0 Liver 196.0 Lymph Node 7.6 Kidney 6.9 Heart 0 5. Brain 1. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: 6 This pattern of distribution is 
consistent with that observed in preclinical studies in dogs in which greatest concentrations of amphotericin B after ABELCET ® administration were observed in the liver, spleen, and lung; however, 
the relationship of tissue concentrations of amphotericin B to its biological activity when administered as ABELCET ® is unknown. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic 
impairment on the disposition of ABELCET ® is not known. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of ABELCET ® is not known. The effect of dialysis on the elimination of 
ABELCET ® has not been studied; however, amphotericin B is not removed by hemodialysis when administered as amphotericin B desoxycholate. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: Pediatric and Elderly 
Patients: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pediatric patients (≤16 years of age) and elderly patients (≥65 years of age) have not been studied.

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics The assay used to measure amphotericin B in the blood after the administration of ABELCET ® does not distinguish 
amphotericin B that is complexed with the phospholipids of ABELCET ® from amphotericin B that is uncomplexed. The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B after the administration of ABELCET ® are 
nonlinear. Volume of distribution and clearance from blood increase with increasing dose of ABELCET ® , resulting in less than proportional increases in blood concentrations of amphotericin B over a 
dose range of 0.6-5 mg/kg/day. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B in whole blood after the administration of ABELCET ® and amphotericin B desoxycholate are:

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate 
patients), of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 
patients were treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with 
ABELCET ® , 9% discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient 
chills and/or fever during infusion of the drug. AMPHOTERICIN B: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14

ANSWER: The available information from the AMPHOTERICIN B label does not directly address whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. However, the label does list a range of 
adverse events associated with the drug, including serious conditions such as multiple organ failure, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and sepsis, which could potentially lead to hospitalization. 
It is important to note that the causal association between these adverse events and AMPHOTERICIN B is uncertain.

        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether AMPHOTERICIN B increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that the AMPHOTERICIN B label does not directly address the risk of hospitalization. However, it lists serious adverse events that could potentially lead to hospitalization, 
such as multiple organ failure, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and sepsis.
3. The causal association between these adverse events and AMPHOTERICIN B is uncertain according to the label information provided by FDAHandler.
