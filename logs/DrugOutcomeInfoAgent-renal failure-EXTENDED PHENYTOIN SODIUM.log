CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: John’s wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, 
valproate sodium c , valproic acid c a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John’s wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic 
acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by 
phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy 
with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting
Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide 
Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance . Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, 
pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered 
phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Prevention or Management: Patients should be 
monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Warfarin Increased and 
decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is co-administered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, 
rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate,
lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, 
nelfin EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: avir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active 
metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, 
verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of 
phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: 3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate 
Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding 
preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding 
preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to 
measure serum phenytoin concentrations.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other 
adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure 
Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to 
recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, 
and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: edpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk 
Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an 
increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial 
features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in 
combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during 
pregnancy. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of
developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general population, the estimated 
background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for 
the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics.
Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage  .         
SOURCE:EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label


CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, 
elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute 
hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in 
association with administration of phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. 
EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) 
including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates
the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS  . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, 
follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The 
chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia,
and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 
5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring 
of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, 
caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn 
Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes . 
Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial 
features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in 
combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: A 
potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can
be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug’s inhibitory effects on insulin 
release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the 
therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as “delirium,” “psychosis,” or “encephalopathy,” or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at 
the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked.

http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal 
hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been
reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, 
including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and 
other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy:
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an 
approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital 
hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

ANSWER: Extended phenytoin sodium does not have a direct reported association with increasing or decreasing the risk of renal failure in the provided label extracts. However, it is noted that the 
monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, suggesting that renal impairment can affect 
phenytoin levels and dosing may need to be adjusted accordingly.

phenytoin sodium does not have a direct reported association with increasing or decreasing the risk of renal failure according to the label extracts. It is important to note that while there isn't a 
direct association mentioned, the label does indicate that monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with 
hypoalbuminemia. This suggests that renal impairment can affect phenytoin levels, and dosing may need to be adjusted in patients with renal issues.

Given this information, we cannot definitively say that extended phenytoin sodium increases or decreases the risk of renal failure, as the FDA label data does not specify a direct causal relationship.
Therefore, the answer to the question is DO-NOT-KNOW, because the FDA label data does not specify whether extended phenytoin sodium increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.

        Question: Does EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether extended phenytoin sodium increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler responded that the label does not report a direct association with increasing or decreasing the risk of renal failure. However, it does mention that monitoring of phenytoin serum levels 
should be based on the unbound fraction in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, indicating that renal impairment can affect phenytoin levels and dosing may need to
be adjusted accordingly.

        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

        If any flaws in the reasoning used to produce your
        answer were identified, you must try again.

PHENYTOIN SODIUM increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?" is DO-NOT-KNOW. This conclusion is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which indicates that the label for extended 
phenytoin sodium does not report a direct association with increasing or decreasing the risk of renal failure. However, the label does mention the need for monitoring phenytoin serum levels in 
patients with renal or hepatic disease, or those with hypoalbuminemia, suggesting that renal impairment can affect phenytoin levels and that dosing adjustments may be necessary. The degree of 
reliability of this answer is based on the specific information provided in the FDA label data, which does not establish a causal relationship between extended phenytoin sodium and renal failure risk.
