CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such 
as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry.
This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a 
pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other 
manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: The background 
risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during 
pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment
of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased 
levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before 
delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2. PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: 4-fold 
increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been 
reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental 
deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth 
retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared 
to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial 
anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to

milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the motherâ€™s clinical need for Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the 
breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: 4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin 
Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin 
concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly 
intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age  . Lower or less frequent 
dosing may be required . 8.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through
a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then
be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration 
may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin
is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 
Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this 
disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks 
for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), 
and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive 
deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases 
of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to 
phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting
from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin 
Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely 
irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is 
indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: information_for_patients: 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION W ithdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their 
healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus  . P otential Signs of Drug Reaction with 
Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic R eac tions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and
in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. PHENYTOIN: information_for_patients: Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, 
that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use  . 
Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physicianâ€™s advice  . 
Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., cimetidine and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. PHENYTOIN: information_for_patients: Johnâ€™s 
wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels  . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good 
dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased 
coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects 
associated with phenytoin. PHENYTOIN: information_for_patients: Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, 
including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including 
microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who 
are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy . Instruct patients to notify
their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy  . PHENYTOIN: 
information_for_patients: Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the 
safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . Manufactured by: Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.
