[32mI asked FDAHandler whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. However, FDAHandler's response was DO-NOT-KNOW, which indicates that the FDA label for DIAZEPAM does not [0m

[32mThe question was whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. I asked FDAHandler for information regarding the effect of DIAZEPAM on the risk of myocardial infarction. [0m
[32mFDAHandler responded with DO-NOT-KNOW, which means that the FDA label for DIAZEPAM does not specify any information about its effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the FDA [0m
[32mlabel data, we cannot determine if DIAZEPAM has any effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. The absence of information in the FDA label suggests that there is no verified causal relationship [0m
[32mestablished or that it has not been sufficiently studied to warrant inclusion in the label.[0m
