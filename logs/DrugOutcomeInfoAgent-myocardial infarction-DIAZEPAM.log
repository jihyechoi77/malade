CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs of 
most patients, there will be some who may require higher doses. In such cases dosage should be increased cautiously to avoid adverse effects. ADULTS: USUAL DAILY DOSE: Management of Anxiety Disorders 
and Relief of Symptoms of Anxiety. Depending upon severity of symptoms—2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily Symptomatic Relief in Acute Alcohol Withdrawal. 10 mg, 3 or 4 times during the first 24 hours, 
reducing to 5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily as needed. Adjunctively for Relief of Skeletal Muscle Spasm. 2 mg to 10 mg, 3 or 4 times daily Adjunctively in Convulsive Disorders. DIAZEPAM: 
dosage_and_administration: 2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily Geriatric Patients, or in the presence of debilitating disease. 2 mg to 2.5 mg, 1 or 2 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed 
and tolerated. PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: Because of varied responses to CNS-acting drugs, initiate therapy with lowest dose and increase as required. Not for use in pediatric patients under 6 months. 1 mg 
to 2.5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated. Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Diazepam Tablets To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual 
taper to discontinue diazepam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. 
DIAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs of 
most patients, there will be some who may require higher doses. In such cases dosage should be increased cautiously to avoid adverse effects. ADULTS: USUAL DAILY DOSE: Management of Anxiety Disorders 
and Relief of Symptoms of Anxiety. Depending upon severity of symptoms—2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily Symptomatic Relief in Acute Alcohol Withdrawal. 10 mg, 3 or 4 times during the first 24 hours, 
reducing to 5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily as needed. Adjunctively for Relief of Skeletal Muscle Spasm. 2 mg to 10 mg, 3 or 4 times daily Adjunctively in Convulsive Disorders. DIAZEPAM: 
dosage_and_administration: 2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily Geriatric Patients, or in the presence of debilitating disease. 2 mg to 2.5 mg, 1 or 2 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed 
and tolerated. PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: Because of varied responses to CNS-acting drugs, initiate therapy with lowest dose and increase as required. Not for use in pediatric patients under 6 months. 1 mg 
to 2.5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated. Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Diazepam Tablets To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual 
taper to discontinue diazepam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. 
DIAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ).

(mania) • new or worse panic attacks • acting on dangerous impulses How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? • Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in 
mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. • Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried 
about symptoms. Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. DIAZEPAM: 
spl_medguide: The most common side effects of diazepam tablets include: • drowsiness • muscle weakness • loss of control of body movements (ataxia) • fatigue These are not all the possible side 
effects of diazepam tablets. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Mylan at 1-877-446-3679

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage should be individualized for maximum beneficial effect. While the usual daily dosages given below will meet the needs of 
most patients, there will be some who may require higher doses. In such cases dosage should be increased cautiously to avoid adverse effects. ADULTS: USUAL DAILY DOSE: Management of Anxiety Disorders 
and Relief of Symptoms of Anxiety. Depending upon severity of symptoms—2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily Symptomatic Relief in Acute Alcohol Withdrawal. 10 mg, 3 or 4 times during the first 24 hours, 
reducing to 5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily as needed. Adjunctively for Relief of Skeletal Muscle Spasm. 2 mg to 10 mg, 3 or 4 times daily Adjunctively in Convulsive Disorders. DIAZEPAM: 
dosage_and_administration: 2 mg to 10 mg, 2 to 4 times daily Geriatric Patients, or in the presence of debilitating disease. 2 mg to 2.5 mg, 1 or 2 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed 
and tolerated. PEDIATRIC PATIENTS: Because of varied responses to CNS-acting drugs, initiate therapy with lowest dose and increase as required. Not for use in pediatric patients under 6 months. 1 mg 
to 2.5 mg, 3 or 4 times daily initially; increase gradually as needed and tolerated. Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Diazepam Tablets To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual 
taper to discontinue diazepam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. 
DIAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: spl_medguide: How should I take diazepam tablets? • Take diazepam tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to take them. Your healthcare provider will tell you how many
diazepam tablets to take and when to take them. • Talk to your healthcare provider about slowly stopping diazepam tablets to avoid withdrawal symptoms. • If you take too many diazepam tablets, call 
your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. What are the possible side effects of diazepam tablets? Diazepam tablets may cause serious side effects, including: • 
See “What is the most important information I should know about diazepam tablets?” • Seizures. Taking diazepam tablets with other medicines used to treat epilepsy can cause an increase in the number 
or severity of grand mal seizures. • Diazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy, and can slow your thinking and motor skills. DIAZEPAM: spl_medguide: o Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do 
other dangerous activities until you know how diazepam tablets affect you. o Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking diazepam tablets without first 
talking to your healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, diazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness much worse. • Like other antiepileptic 
drugs, diazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. DIAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of 
these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: • thoughts about suicide or dying • new or worse depression • feeling agitated or restless • trouble sleeping (insomnia) • acting 
aggressive, being angry, or violent • other unusual changes in behavior or mood • attempts to commit suicide • new or worse anxiety or irritability • an extreme increase in activity and talking 
(mania) • new or worse panic attacks • acting on dangerous impulses How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? • Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in 
mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. • Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried 
about symptoms. Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. DIAZEPAM: 
spl_medguide: The most common side effects of diazepam tablets include: • drowsiness • muscle weakness • loss of control of body movements (ataxia) • fatigue These are not all the possible side 
effects of diazepam tablets. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. You may also report side effects to Mylan at 1-877-446-3679 
(1-877-4-INFO-RX). How should I store diazepam tablets? • Store diazepam tablets in a tightly closed container at room temperature between 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). Protect from light. • Keep

I asked FDAHandler whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. However, FDAHandler's response was DO-NOT-KNOW, which indicates that the FDA label for DIAZEPAM does not 
contain information regarding its effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. This means that there is no verified causal relationship between DIAZEPAM and myocardial infarction mentioned in the FDA 
label, and therefore, we cannot determine if DIAZEPAM has any effect on the risk of this condition based on the FDA label data.

Given this information, my final answer must also be DO-NOT-KNOW, as there is no available evidence from the FDA label to suggest that DIAZEPAM either increases or decreases the risk of myocardial 
infarction.

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.

            do so with the `final_answer` tool/function, as I have requested.
        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must

The question was whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. I asked FDAHandler for information regarding the effect of DIAZEPAM on the risk of myocardial infarction. 
FDAHandler responded with DO-NOT-KNOW, which means that the FDA label for DIAZEPAM does not specify any information about its effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the FDA 
label data, we cannot determine if DIAZEPAM has any effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. The absence of information in the FDA label suggests that there is no verified causal relationship 
established or that it has not been sufficiently studied to warrant inclusion in the label.
