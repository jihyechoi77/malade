Clinical Laboratory Values The effect of Am B isome on renal and hepatic function and on serum electrolytes was assessed from laboratory values measured repeatedly in Study 94-0-002. The frequency and
magnitude of hepatic test abnormalities were similar in the Am B isome and amphotericin B groups. Nephrotoxicity was defined as creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in 
pediatric patients, and creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in adult patients, provided the peak creatinine concentration was > 1.2 mg/dL. Hypokalemia was defined as 
potassium levels ≤ 2.5 mmol/L any time during treatment. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Incidence of nephrotoxicity, mean peak serum creatinine concentration, mean change from baseline in serum 
creatinine, and incidence of hypokalemia in the double-blind, randomized study were lower in the Am B isome group as summarized in the following table: Study 94-0-002 Laboratory Evidence of 
Nephrotoxicity AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/day Total number of patients receiving at least one dose of study drug 343 344 Nephrotoxicity 64 (18.7%) 116 (33.7%) Mean peak creatinine

above the temperature taken within 1 hour prior to infusion (preinfusion temperature) or above the lowest infusion value (no preinfusion temperature recorded). Patients were not administered 
premedications to prevent infusion-related reactions prior to the Day 1 study drug infusion. In Study 94-0-013, a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial comparing Am B isome and amphotericin B 
deoxycholate as initial therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, premedications to prevent infusion-related reactions were permitted. Am B isome-treated patients had a lower incidence of fever,

reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with Am B isome administration; on occasion this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the 
reaction developed within a few minutes after the start of infusion and disappeared rapidly when the infusion was stopped. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: The symptoms do not occur with every dose and 
usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse 
events also have been reported in 2% to 10% of Am B isome-treated patients receiving chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, or who had HIV disease in six comparative, clinical trials: Body as a

CONTENT: AMBISOME: clinical_studies: One controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of Am B isome to amphotericin B in HIV patients with cryptococcal meningitis. One compassionate use study 
enrolled patients who had failed amphotericin B deoxycholate therapy or who were unable to receive amphotericin B deoxycholate because of renal insufficiency. Empirical Therapy in Febrile Neutropenic 
Patients Study 94-0-002, a randomized, double-blind, comparative multi-center trial, evaluated the efficacy of Am B isome (1.5-6 mg/kg/day) compared with amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.3-1.2 
mg/kg/day) in the empirical treatment of 687 adult and pediatric neutropenic patients who were febrile despite having received at least 96 hours of broad spectrum antibacterial therapy. AMBISOME: 
clinical_studies: Therapeutic success required (a) resolution of fever during the neutropenic period, (b) absence of an emergent fungal infection, (c) patient survival for at least 7 days post 
therapy, (d) no discontinuation of therapy due to toxicity or lack of efficacy, and (e) resolution of any study-entry fungal infection. The overall therapeutic success rates for Am B isome and the 
amphotericin B deoxycholate were equivalent. Results are summarized in the following table. Note: The categories presented below are not mutually exclusive. Empirical Therapy in Febrile Neutropenic 
Patients: Randomized, Double-Blind Study in 687 Patients AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/day Number of patients receiving at least one dose of study drug 343 344 Overall Success 171

The incidence of mycologically-confirmed, and clinically-diagnosed, emergent fungal infections are presented in the following table. Am B isome and amphotericin B were found to be equivalent with 
respect to the total number of emergent fungal infections. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Empirical Therapy in Febrile Neutropenic Patients: Emergent Fungal Infections AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B

amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day) in the empirical treatment of 202 adult and 42 pediatric neutropenic patients. One hundred and sixty-six (166) patients received Am B isome (85 patients 
received 3 mg/kg/day and 81 received 5 mg/kg/day) and 78 patients received amphotericin B lipid complex. The study patients were febrile despite having received at least 72 hours of broad spectrum 
antibacterial therapy. The primary endpoint of this study was safety. The study was not designed to draw statistically meaningful conclusions related to comparative efficacy and, in fact, Abelcet is 
not labeled for this indication.

CONTENT: AMBISOME: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION AmBisome is not interchangeable or substitutable on a mg per mg basis with other amphotericin B products. Different amphotericin
B products are not equivalent in terms of pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics and dosing. Am B isome should be administered by intravenous infusion, using a controlled infusion device, over a period of
approximately 120 minutes. An in-line membrane filter may be used for the intravenous infusion of Am B isome, provided THE MEAN PORE DIAMETER OF THE FILTER IS NOT LESS THAN 1.0 MICRON . NOTE: An 
existing intravenous line must be flushed with 5% Dextrose Injection prior to infusion of AmBisome. If this is not feasible, AmBisome must be administered through a separate line. Infusion time may be
reduced to approximately 60 minutes in patients in whom the treatment is well-tolerated. AMBISOME: dosage_and_administration: If the patient experiences discomfort during infusion, the duration of 
infusion may be increased. The recommended initial dose of Am B isome for each indication for adult and pediatric patients is as follows: Indication Dose (mg/kg/day) Empirical therapy 3 Systemic 
fungal infections: Aspergillus Candida Cryptococcus 3 - 5 Cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-infected patients (see DESCRIPTION OF CLINICAL STUDIES ) 6 Dosing and rate of infusion should be individualized
to the needs of the specific patient to ensure maximum efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicities or adverse events. AMBISOME: dosage_and_administration: Doses recommended for visceral 
leishmaniasis are presented below: Visceral Leishmaniasis Dose (mg/kg/day) Immunocompetent patients 3 (days 1 - 5) and 3 on days 14, 21 Immunocompromised patients 4 (days 1 - 5) and 4 on days 10, 17, 
24, 31, 38 For immunocompetent patients who do not achieve parasitic clearance with the recommended dose, a repeat course of therapy may be useful. For immunocompromised patients who do not clear 
parasites or who experience relapses, expert advice regarding further treatment is recommended. For additional information, see DESCRIPTION OF CLINICAL STUDIES .

        Question: Does AMBISOME increase or decrease the risk of acute liver injury?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether AMBISOME increases the risk of acute liver injury.
2. FDAHandler responded that the AMBISOME label does not specifically mention acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. However, it was noted that the frequency and magnitude of hepatic test 
abnormalities were similar in the AMBISOME and amphotericin B groups, suggesting that AMBISOME does not significantly increase the risk of hepatic issues compared to amphotericin B.
3. The label focuses on nephrotoxicity and other adverse reactions, but acute liver injury is not listed among the common or less common adverse events.
        -----
        Final answer: Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, AMBISOME does not specifically list acute liver injury as an adverse reaction, and the risk of hepatic issues does not appear to 
be significantly increased compared to amphotericin B. Therefore, it is not indicated that AMBISOME increases the risk of acute liver injury.

The final answer to the question "Does AMBISOME increase or decrease the risk of acute liver injury?" is that, based on the information provided by FDAHandler, AMBISOME does not specifically list 
acute liver injury as an adverse reaction. The frequency and magnitude of hepatic test abnormalities were reported to be similar in the AMBISOME and amphotericin B groups, suggesting that AMBISOME 
does not significantly increase the risk of hepatic issues compared to amphotericin B. Therefore, it is not indicated that AMBISOME increases the risk of acute liver injury.
