CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: drug_abuse_and_dependence: The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, 
seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol). Dependence 
Physical Dependence Lorazepam may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug 
use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or 
administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal 
adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i. LORAZEPAM: drug_abuse_and_dependence: ., higher and/or more frequent doses) 
and those who have had longer durations of use (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions ). To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue lorazepam or reduce 
the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of lorazepam and WARNINGS ). Acute Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with 
benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, 
restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. LORAZEPAM: drug_abuse_and_dependence: More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, 
convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, seizures and suicidality. Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome Protracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is 
characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks
after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from 
potential re‑-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used. Tolerance Tolerance to lorazepam may develop from continued therapy. LORAZEPAM: 
drug_abuse_and_dependence: Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same
effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of lorazepam may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive 
impairments caused by benzodiazepines.         
SOURCE:LORAZEPAM label


CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: precautions: However, use of lorazepam for prolonged periods and in geriatric patients requires caution, and there should be frequent monitoring for symptoms of upper GI disease. 
Safety and effectiveness of lorazepam in children of less than 12 years have not been established. Information for Patients Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication 
Guide ). Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of potentially fatal respiratory depression and sedation when lorazepam is used with opioids and 
not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a healthcare provider. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been 
determined (see WARNINGS: Risks from Concomitant Use of Opioids and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). LORAZEPAM: precautions: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction Inform patients that the use of lorazepam 
even at recommended doses, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid 
analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or 
symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ). Withdrawal Reactions Inform patients that the continued use of lorazepam
may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of lorazepam may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening.
LORAZEPAM: precautions: Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 
months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of lorazepam may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ). Pregnancy 
Advise pregnant females that use of lorazepam late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, 
restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Instruct patients to inform 
their healthcare provider if they are pregnant. LORAZEPAM: precautions: Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to lorazepam 
during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Nursing Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Instruct breastfeeding patients using 
lorazepam to monitor infants for excessive sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ). Essential 
Laboratory Tests Some patients on lorazepam have developed leukopenia, and some have had elevations of LDH. As with other benzodiazepines, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are 
recommended for patients on long-term therapy. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different 
receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA A sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. LORAZEPAM: precautions: When benzodiazepines and opioids 
are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and 
monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. The benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, produce increased CNS-depressant effects when administered with other CNS depressants such 
as alcohol, barbiturates, antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, sedative antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics. Concomitant use of clozapine
and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased 
plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. LORAZEPAM: precautions: Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration 
of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by 
approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline
may reduce the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis No evidence of carcinogenic potential emerged in rats during an 18-month study with lorazepam. 
No studies regarding mutagenesis have been performed. LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to 
psychiatric medications, including lorazepam, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 
1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience 
symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant 
women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the 
indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: general population, the estimated risk of 
major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Benzodiazepines cross the
placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, 
hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal 
Syndrome ). Data Human Data Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects.

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Studies in healthy volunteers show that in single high doses lorazepam has a tranquilizing action on the central nervous system with no
appreciable effect on the respiratory or cardiovascular systems. Lorazepam is readily absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 90%. Peak concentrations in plasma occur approximately 2 hours 
following administration. The peak plasma level of lorazepam from a 2 mg dose is approximately 20 ng/mL. The mean half-life of unconjugated lorazepam in human plasma is about 12 hours and for its 
major metabolite, lorazepam glucuronide, about 18 hours. At clinically relevant concentrations, lorazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins. Lorazepam is rapidly conjugated at its 
3-hydroxy group into lorazepam glucuronide which is then excreted in the urine. Lorazepam glucuronide has no demonstrable central nervous system (CNS) activity in animals. LORAZEPAM: 
clinical_pharmacology: The plasma levels of lorazepam are proportional to the dose given. There is no evidence of accumulation of lorazepam on administration up to 6 months. Studies comparing young 
and elderly subjects have shown that advancing age does not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam. However, in one study involving single intravenous doses of 1.5 to 3 mg of 
lorazepam Injection, mean total body clearance of lorazepam decreased by 20% in 15 elderly subjects of 60 to 84 years of age compared to that in 15 younger subjects of 19 to 38 years of age.         
SOURCE:LORAZEPAM label


CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can 
include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, 
impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of 
benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal (see WARNINGS: Abuse, Misuse , and Addiction ). Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood 
pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raise the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage. LORAZEPAM: overdosage: In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ 
general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway management. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the 
sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage 
with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with 
flumazenil use may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., 
status epilepticus). LORAZEPAM: overdosage: If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. 
See the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information. Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.

ANSWER: Lorazepam is an antianxiety agent that belongs to the class of drugs known as benzodiazepines. It is used to treat anxiety disorders and for the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety or 
anxiety associated with depression. Lorazepam is available in tablet form for oral administration, with dosages of 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 2 mg. The medication can cause serious side effects, including coma 
and death, particularly if abused or misused. It has the potential to cause physical dependence and withdrawal reactions, and should not be stopped suddenly due to the risk of serious and 
life-threatening side effects. Lorazepam is a controlled substance due to its potential for abuse and dependence. It is not known if lorazepam is safe and effective for use in children under 12 years 
of age or for use longer than 4 months. The medication can interact with other drugs, especially opioids, leading to increased risk of respiratory depression and sedation. It is also contraindicated 
in patients with certain medical conditions and should be used with caution in elderly patients and those with a history of drug or alcohol abuse or addiction.

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the
majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not 
confirmed these findings. Animal Data Reproductive studies in animals were performed in mice, rats, and two strains of rabbits. Occasional anomalies (reduction of tarsals, tibia, metatarsals, 
malrotated limbs, gastroschisis, malformed skull, and microphthalmia) were seen in drug-treated rabbits without relationship to dosage. Although all of these anomalies were not present in the 
concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg and higher, there was evidence of fetal resorption and increased fetal loss in rabbits 
which was not seen at lower doses. LORAZEPAM: precautions: Nursing Mothers Risk Summary Lorazepam is present in breast milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants
exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. The effects of lorazepam on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the 
mother’s clinical need for lorazepam and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from lorazepam or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to 
lorazepam through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of lorazepam generally were not adequate to determine whether subjects
aged 65 and over respond differently than younger subjects; however, the incidence of sedation and unsteadiness was observed to increase with age (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Age does not appear to have 
a significant effect on lorazepam kinetics (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). LORAZEPAM: precautions: Clinical circumstances, some of which may be more common in the elderly, such as hepatic or renal 
impairment, should be considered. Greater sensitivity (e.g., sedation) of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, and lower 
doses may be sufficient in these patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including CNS effects and respiratory depression, are dose dependent, with more severe effects 
occurring with high doses. In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), 
and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. LORAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, 
drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, 
convulsions/seizures, tremor, vertigo, eye function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, 
coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, 
increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, 
alopecia; syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic LORAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: hormone (SIADH), hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic 
manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases
in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS,

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: precautions: Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy
). Nursing Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Instruct breastfeeding patients using lorazepam to monitor infants for excessive 
sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ). Essential Laboratory Tests Some patients on lorazepam have 
developed leukopenia, and some have had elevations of LDH. As with other benzodiazepines, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are recommended for patients on long-term therapy. Drug 
Interactions The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. 
Benzodiazepines interact at GABA A sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. LORAZEPAM: precautions: When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to 
significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression 
and sedation. The benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, produce increased CNS-depressant effects when administered with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates, antipsychotics, 
sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, sedative antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics. Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked 
sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in increased plasma concentrations and reduced 
clearance of lorazepam. LORAZEPAM: precautions: Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may 
result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered 
with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline may reduce the sedative effects of 
benzodiazepines, including lorazepam. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis No evidence of carcinogenic potential emerged in rats during an 18-month study with lorazepam. No studies regarding mutagenesis 
have been performed. LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to psychiatric medications, including 
lorazepam, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at 
https://womensmentalhealth.org/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal 
withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do 
not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All 
pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage 
in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory 
depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor 
neonates exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome ). Data Human Data Published data 
from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects.

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS • Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). • The use of benzodiazepines, 
including lorazepam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other 
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. LORAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing lorazepam and throughout 
treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ). • The continued use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may lead to clinically significant physical 
dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of lorazepam after continued use may 
precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue lorazepam or reduce the dosage ( DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ).

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Lorazepam tablets are administered orally. For optimal results, dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy 
should be individualized according to patient response. To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available. The usual range is 2 to 6 mg/day given in divided doses, the largest dose 
being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg/day. For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg/day given two times a day or three times a day. For 
insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime. For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg/day in 
divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated. LORAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: The dosage of lorazepam tablets should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid 
adverse effects. When higher dosage is indicated, the evening dose should be increased before the daytime doses. Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Lorazepam Tablets To reduce the risk of 
withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue lorazepam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the 
previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ).

drug's effect on the risk of renal failure. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not known whether Lorazepam increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.

<DONE> DO-NOT-KNOW

Justification: The FDAHandler, which provides information based on FDA label data, has indicated that there is no information available in the Lorazepam label regarding its impact on renal failure 
risk. Consequently, we cannot determine whether Lorazepam has any effect on the risk of renal failure.
