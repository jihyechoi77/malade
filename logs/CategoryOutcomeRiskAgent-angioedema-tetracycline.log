[34mof the possible hypersensitivity reactions reported with its use.[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. Drug TIGECYCLINE: The FDA label for TIGECYCLINE does not specifically list angioedema as an adverse reaction, but anaphylactic reactions, which can include symptoms such as angioedema, have been [0m
[34mreported. Therefore, while a direct causal relationship is not established, there is a potential risk of angioedema, especially in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines.[0m
