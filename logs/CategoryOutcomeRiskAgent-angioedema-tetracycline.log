                Passages:
                1. Drug DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE can increase the risk of angioedema. This information is based on the FDA label for DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE, which lists angioedema as one 
of the possible hypersensitivity reactions reported with its use.
2. Drug TIGECYCLINE: The FDA label for TIGECYCLINE does not specifically list angioedema as an adverse reaction, but anaphylactic reactions, which can include symptoms such as angioedema, have been 
reported. Therefore, while a direct causal relationship is not established, there is a potential risk of angioedema, especially in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines.
3. Drug MINOCYCLINE: The final answer is that MINOCYCLINE has been reported to increase the risk of angioedema. This information comes from postmarketing experiences listed in the drug label.

                Does the tetracycline category of drugs increase the risk of
                angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the tetracycline category of drugs increase the risk of angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 states that DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE can increase the risk of angioedema, as reported in the FDA label.
2. Passage 2 indicates that while TIGECYCLINE's FDA label does not specifically list angioedema, anaphylactic reactions including symptoms such as angioedema have been reported, suggesting a potential
risk.
3. Passage 3 reports that MINOCYCLINE increases the risk of angioedema based on postmarketing experiences.
4. All three drugs mentioned, which belong to the tetracycline category, have been associated with an increased risk of angioedema, either directly or as part of a broader spectrum of hypersensitivity
reactions.

        Final answer: increase
