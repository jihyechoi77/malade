        Below are some relevant extracts for your query:
        -----
        
CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: information_for_patients: All patients taking doxycycline should be advised: — to avoid excessive sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline and
to discontinue therapy if phototoxicity (e.g., skin eruption, etc.) occurs. Sunscreen or sunblock should be considered. (See WARNINGS .) — to drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce 
the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .) — that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taken with foods, especially those which contain calcium. However, 
the absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk. (See DRUG INTERACTIONS .) — that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taking bismuth 
subsalicylate. (See DRUG INTERACTIONS . DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: information_for_patients: ) — that the use of doxycycline might increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis. Patients should be counseled
that antibacterial drugs, including doxycycline should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When doxycycline is prescribed to treat a
bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not 
completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by 
doxycycline or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, which usually ends when the antibacterials are discontinued. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: 
precautions: Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months 
after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests In venereal disease, when co-existent syphilis
is suspected, dark field examinations should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least 4 months. In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of 
organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal, and hepatic studies, should be performed. Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who 
are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: precautions: Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of 
penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracyclines in conjunction with penicillin. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium, or magnesium, and 
iron-containing preparations. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by bismuth subsalicylate. Barbiturates, carbamazepine, and phenytoin decrease the half-life of doxycycline. The concurrent use of 
tetracycline and Penthrane ® (methoxyflurane) has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracycline may render oral contraceptives less effective. Drug/Laboratory Test 
Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: precautions: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment Of 
Fertility Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of doxycycline have not been conducted. However, there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the 
related antibacterial drugs, oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors), and minocycline (thyroid tumors). Likewise, although mutagenicity studies of doxycycline have not been conducted, positive 
results in in vitro mammalian cell assays have been reported for related antibacterial drugs (tetracycline, oxytetracycline). Doxycycline administered orally at dosage levels as high as 250 mg/kg/day 
had no apparent effect on the fertility of female rats. Effect on male fertility has not been studied. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of 
doxycycline in pregnant women.

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Dialysis does not alter serum half-life and
thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage.

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: WARNINGS The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause 
permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel
hypoplasia has also been reported. Use doxycycline in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening 
conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly 
all antibacterial agents, including doxycycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to 
overgrowth of C. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause 
increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following
the use of antibacterial drugs. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or 
confirmed, ongoing use of antibacterial drugs not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial 
treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema 
multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. (See ADVERSE 
REACTIONS .) If severe skin reactions occur, doxycycline should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been 
associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women
of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Concomitant use of isotretinoin and 
doxycycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual 
loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients 
should be monitored until they stabilize. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral 
tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are 
found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Evidence of embryotoxicity has also 
been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus. The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with
impaired renal function. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or 
ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral doxycycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects of the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been 
infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Gastrointestinal: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, 
inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, and pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral 
administration of tetracyclines. Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition, reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported. Permanent tooth 
discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development. (See WARNINGS . DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ) Rare instances of 
esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of the drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately 
before going to bed. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, skin hyperpigmentation, maculopapular and erythematous rashes. 
Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Photosensitivity is discussed above. (See WARNINGS .) Renal toxicity: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related. (See 
WARNINGS . DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ) Immune: Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, 
exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction has been reported in the setting of spirochete 
infections treated with doxycycline. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Other: Bulging fontanels in infants and intracranial hypertension in 
adults. (See WARNINGS .) When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. No abnormalities of thyroid function
studies are known to occur.

ANSWER: Doxycycline Hyclate has been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity. Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage when taking 
Doxycycline Hyclate. This suggests that Doxycycline Hyclate could potentially increase the risk of bleeding in patients on anticoagulant therapy due to its effect on prothrombin activity.
