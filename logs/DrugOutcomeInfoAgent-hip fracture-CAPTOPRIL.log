Let me clarify the reasoning behind the [0m
[32mDO-NOT-KNOW response.[0m

[32mThe question asked was whether CAPTOPRIL increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. To answer this question, I reached out to FDAHandler, which is a source that can provide information based on [0m
[32mFDA data regarding the effects of drugs, including CAPTOPRIL.[0m

[32mHowever, I did not receive a response from FDAHandler, which means that I do not have the necessary information to determine if CAPTOPRIL has an effect on the risk of hip fracture. Without this [0m
[32mspecific information from FDA data, I cannot provide a reliable answer.[0m

[32mThe lack of response from FDAHandler could be due to various reasons, including the possibility that the FDA data does not specify the effect of CAPTOPRIL on the risk of hip fracture, or there may be [0m
[32ma technical issue preventing the retrieval of the information.[0m

[32mTherefore, the DO-NOT-KNOW response is based on the absence of information from FDAHandler, which is the source I am required to consult for this specific question. Without data from FDAHandler, I [0m
[32mcannot comment on the strength of evidence or the magnitude of the effect of CAPTOPRIL on hip fracture risk.[0m
