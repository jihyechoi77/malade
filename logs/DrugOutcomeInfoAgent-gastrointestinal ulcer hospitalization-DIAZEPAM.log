CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration > 90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1-1.5 hours with 
a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours. Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 
minutes when fasting. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting. This results in 
an average decrease in C max of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food. Distribution Diazepam and its metabolites are highly bound to plasma proteins 
(diazepam 98%). DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Diazepam and its metabolites cross the blood-brain and placental barriers and are also found in breast milk in concentrations approximately one tenth of 
those in maternal plasma (days 3 to 9 post-partum). In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg. The decline in the plasma concentration-time profile after 
oral administration is biphasic. The initial distribution phase has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, although it may range up to > 3 hours. Metabolism Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19
to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam. DIAZEPAM: 
pharmacokinetics: Temazepam and oxazepam are largely eliminated by glucuronidation. Elimination The initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48
hours). The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours. Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their 
glucuronide conjugates. The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults. Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is 
slightly prolonged.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS • Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). • The use of benzodiazepines, 
including diazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other 
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing diazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . • The continued use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of diazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam tablets 
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration > 90% of diazepam is absorbed and the average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1-1.5 hours with 
a range of 0.25 to 2.5 hours. Absorption is delayed and decreased when administered with a moderate fat meal. In the presence of food mean lag times are approximately 45 minutes as compared with 15 
minutes when fasting. There is also an increase in the average time to achieve peak concentrations to about 2.5 hours in the presence of food as compared with 1.25 hours when fasting. This results in 
an average decrease in C max of 20% in addition to a 27% decrease in AUC (range 15% to 50%) when administered with food. Distribution Diazepam and its metabolites are highly bound to plasma proteins 
(diazepam 98%). DIAZEPAM: pharmacokinetics: Diazepam and its metabolites cross the blood-brain and placental barriers and are also found in breast milk in concentrations approximately one tenth of 
those in maternal plasma (days 3 to 9 post-partum). In young healthy males, the volume of distribution at steady-state is 0.8 to 1.0 L/kg. The decline in the plasma concentration-time profile after 
oral administration is biphasic. The initial distribution phase has a half-life of approximately 1 hour, although it may range up to > 3 hours. Metabolism Diazepam is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and 2C19
to the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam, and is hydroxylated by CYP3A4 to the active metabolite temazepam. N-desmethyldiazepam and temazepam are both further metabolized to oxazepam. DIAZEPAM: 
pharmacokinetics: Temazepam and oxazepam are largely eliminated by glucuronidation. Elimination The initial distribution phase is followed by a prolonged terminal elimination phase (half-life up to 48
hours). The terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam is up to 100 hours. Diazepam and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine, predominantly as their 
glucuronide conjugates. The clearance of diazepam is 20 to 30 mL/min in young adults. Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is 
slightly prolonged.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS • Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). • The use of benzodiazepines, 
including diazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other 
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing diazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . • The continued use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of diazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam tablets 
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .

ANSWER: Diazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative used for oral administration as tablets containing 2 mg, 5 mg, or 10 mg diazepam. It is indicated for the treatment of anxiety disorders, short-term 
relief of anxiety symptoms, alcohol withdrawal symptoms, muscle spasms, and as an adjunct in convulsive disorders. Diazepam is a Schedule IV controlled substance and has common side effects including 
drowsiness, muscle weakness, loss of control of body movements (ataxia), and fatigue. It is not recommended for use in children under 6 months of age or for use longer than 4 months without medical 
advice. Diazepam can cause serious side effects such as seizures, increased risk of grand mal seizures when taken with other epilepsy medicines, dizziness, and suicidal thoughts or actions in a very 
small number of people.

mention any effect of Diazepam on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. The label details the indications for Diazepam, which include the treatment of anxiety disorders, short-term 
relief of anxiety symptoms, alcohol withdrawal symptoms, muscle spasms, and as an adjunct in convulsive disorders. It also lists common side effects such as drowsiness, muscle weakness, ataxia, and 
fatigue, as well as serious side effects like seizures, increased risk of grand mal seizures, dizziness, and suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people.

Since the FDA label data provided does not specify any information regarding the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization associated with Diazepam, the answer to the question is DO-NOT-KNOW. 
This indicates that there may not be any effect on the risk of the condition, or it may not have been studied or reported in the context of the FDA label.

        Do one of the following:

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.
            DO NOT REPEAT your original message; ONLY specify the 
            `intended_recipient` via this tool/function-call.
        2. If you are ready to have the critic check your answer,
            do so with the `final_answer` tool/function, as I have requested.
        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
        else to say, you MUST EXIT IMMEDIATELY by stating that you are done
        with the usual code (as in #3).

The FDA label information for Diazepam does not mention any effect on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, we cannot determine whether Diazepam increases or decreases the 
risk of this condition based on the available FDA label data.
