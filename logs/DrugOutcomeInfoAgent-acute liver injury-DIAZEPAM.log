CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: precautions: Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses 
of diazepam during organogenesis. Rodent studies have indicated that prenatal exposure to diazepam doses similar to those used clinically can produce long-term changes in cellular immune responses, 
brain neurochemistry, and behavior. Nursing Mothers Diazepam is present in breastmilk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding, and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through 
breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reaction, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in breastfed infants, advise patient that breastfeeding is not recommended during 
treatment with diazepam tablets. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established. DIAZEPAM: precautions: Geriatric Use In elderly 
patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once or twice daily, initially to be 
increased gradually as needed and tolerated). Extensive accumulation of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, has been noted following chronic administration of diazepam in healthy 
elderly male subjects. Metabolites of this drug are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because 
elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Hepatic Insufficiency Decreases in clearance 
and protein binding, and increases in volume of distribution and half-life have been reported in patients with cirrhosis. DIAZEPAM: precautions: In such patients, a 2- to 5-fold increase in mean 
half-life has been reported. Delayed elimination has also been reported for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam. Benzodiazepines are commonly implicated in hepatic encephalopathy. Increases in 
half-life have also been reported in hepatic fibrosis and in both acute and chronic hepatitis (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations: Hepatic Insufficiency ).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects most commonly reported were drowsiness, fatigue, muscle weakness, and ataxia. The following have also been reported: Central 
Nervous System: confusion, depression, dysarthria, headache, slurred speech, tremor, vertigo Gastrointestinal System: constipation, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances Special Senses: blurred 
vision, diplopia, dizziness Cardiovascular System: hypotension Psychiatric and Paradoxical Reactions: stimulation, restlessness, acute hyperexcited states, anxiety, agitation, aggressiveness, 
irritability, rage, hallucinations, psychoses, delusions, increased muscle spasticity, insomnia, sleep disturbances, and nightmares. Inappropriate behavior and other adverse behavioral effects have 
been reported when using benzodiazepines. Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued. They are more likely to occur in children and in the elderly. DIAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: 
Urogenital System: incontinence, changes in libido, urinary retention Skin and Appendages: skin reactions Laboratories: elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase Other: changes in salivation, 
including dry mouth, hypersalivation Antegrade amnesia may occur using therapeutic dosages, the risk increasing at higher dosages. Amnestic effects may be associated with inappropriate behavior. Minor
changes in EEG patterns, usually low-voltage fast activity, have been observed in patients during and after diazepam tablets therapy and are of no known significance. Because of isolated reports of 
neutropenia and jaundice, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy. Postmarketing Experience Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications There have been
reports of falls and fractures in benzodiazepine users. The risk is increased in those taking concomitant sedatives (including alcohol), and in the elderly.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or 
symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ). Withdrawal Reactions Inform patients that the continued use of diazepam
tablets may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of diazepam tablets may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be 
life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. 
Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of diazepam tablets may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ). DIAZEPAM: 
information_for_patients: Patients should be advised against the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS-depressant drugs during diazepam tablets therapy. As is true of most CNS-acting drugs, 
patients receiving diazepam tablets should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. Pregnancy
Advise pregnant females that use of diazepam tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, 
restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Instruct patients to inform 
their healthcare provider if they are pregnant. Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to diazepam tablets during pregnancy (see 
Precautions , Pregnancy ). DIAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Nursing Advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with diazepam tablets (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: dependence: Dependence Physical Dependence Diazepam tablets may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of 
physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or
rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening. 
Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent 
doses), those who have had longer durations of use (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions ). DIAZEPAM: dependence: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to 
discontinue diazepam tablets or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Diazepam Tablets and WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions ). Acute 
Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, 
derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis, hypertension, irritability, insomnia, 
memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. DIAZEPAM: dependence: More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including 
life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, seizures, and suicidality. Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome Protracted 
withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), 
paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be 
difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for which the benzodiazepine was being used; however, little tolerance develops to the 
amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS • Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). • The use of benzodiazepines, 
including diazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other 
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. DIAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing diazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . • The continued use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of diazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue diazepam tablets 
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .         
SOURCE:DIAZEPAM label


CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: Diazepam accumulates upon multiple dosing and there is some evidence that the terminal elimination half-life is slightly prolonged. Pharmacokinetics in 
Special Populations Children In children 3-8 years old the mean half-life of diazepam has been reported to be 18 hours. Newborns In full term infants, elimination half-lives around 30 hours have been 
reported, with a longer average half-life of 54 hours reported in premature infants of 28-34 weeks gestational age and 8-81 days post-partum. In both premature and full term infants the active 
metabolite desmethyldiazepam shows evidence of continued accumulation compared to children. Longer half-lives in infants may be due to incomplete maturation of metabolic pathways. Geriatric 
Elimination half-life increases by approximately 1 hour for each year of age beginning with a half-life of 20 hours at 20 years of age. DIAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: This appears to be due to an 
increase in volume of distribution with age and a decrease in clearance. Consequently, the elderly may have lower peak concentrations, and on multiple dosing higher trough concentrations. It will also
take longer to reach steady-state. Conflicting information has been published on changes of plasma protein binding in the elderly. Reported changes in free drug may be due to significant decreases in 
plasma proteins due to causes other than simply aging. Hepatic Insufficiency In mild and moderate cirrhosis, average half-life is increased. The average increase has been variously reported from 
2-fold to 5-fold, with individual half-lives over 500 hours reported. There is also an increase in volume of distribution, and average clearance decreases by almost half. DIAZEPAM: 
clinical_pharmacology: Mean half-life is also prolonged with hepatic fibrosis to 90 hours (range 66-104 hours), with chronic active hepatitis to 60 hours (range 26-76 hours), and with acute viral 
hepatitis to 74 hours (range 49-129). In chronic active hepatitis, clearance is decreased by almost half.

ANSWER: Diazepam has been reported to cause increases in half-life and delayed elimination in patients with hepatic insufficiency, including those with hepatic fibrosis and both acute and chronic 
hepatitis. While the label does not explicitly state that diazepam increases the risk of acute liver injury, it does indicate that caution should be exercised in patients with impaired liver function,
as the drug's metabolism and clearance are affected in such conditions.

The question was whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of acute liver injury. Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, the FDA label does not explicitly state that diazepam 
increases the risk of acute liver injury. However, it does indicate that diazepam's pharmacokinetics are altered in patients with hepatic insufficiency, which includes conditions such as hepatic 
fibrosis and hepatitis. This suggests that there is a potential for increased risk or exacerbation of liver injury in patients with pre-existing liver conditions, and therefore caution is advised when
prescribing diazepam to such patients. The degree of risk for acute liver injury specifically due to diazepam in patients without pre-existing liver conditions is not clearly stated in the FDA label 
data.
