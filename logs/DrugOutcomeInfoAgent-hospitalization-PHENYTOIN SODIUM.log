[32mThe question asked was whether phenytoin sodium increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. I initiated a query to FDAHandler to obtain information on the effects of phenytoin sodium on [0m
[32mhospitalization risk. However, I have not received any data or response from FDAHandler that would enable me to provide a substantiated answer. Therefore, without specific information from the FDA [0m
