CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: information_for_patients: Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, 
may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or 
the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers  . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients
of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician  . EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: information_for_patients: Potential Signs of
Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, 
hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and 
petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, 
that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use  . 
Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients 
should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider  . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin sodium and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of 
angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling  . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or 
alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician’s advice [ Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2 )] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
information_for_patients: antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John’s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise 
patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels  . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival 
hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not
to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
information_for_patients: Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft 
lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When 
appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective 
contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy . Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or 
intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy  .

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be 
done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 
5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not 
be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are
present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and 
cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of 
acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an 
alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status 
epilepticus. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant 
medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, 
alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin sodium, increase 
the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of 
depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials 
(mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal 
thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among
27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 
patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on 
suicide.

toyn soe‘ dee um) capsules What is the most important information I should know about extended phenytoin sodium capsules? 1. Do not stop taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking
to your healthcare provider. Stopping extended phenytoin sodium capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures
that will not stop (status epilepticus). 2. Like other antiepileptic drugs, extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. 
EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: spl_medguide: Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying New 
or worse anxiety Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Acting on dangerous impulses Attempts to commit suicide Feeling agitated or restless New or worse irritability An extreme increase in activity and talking 
(mania) New or worse depression Panic attacks Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than 
medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any 
changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as 
needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. 3. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: spl_medguide: Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect 
different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have
any or all of these symptoms: Fever Sore throat Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Rash Sores in your mouth Nausea Swollen lymph glands Bruise easily Vomiting Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue 
Trouble swallowing or breathing Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms
are mild or if you have been taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. 4. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
spl_medguide: Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: 
dizziness tiredness feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats chest pain What are extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are a prescription medicine 
used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take extended phenytoin sodium capsules if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or 
any of the ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Have had an allergic reaction to 
CEREBYX (fosphenytoin), PEGANONE (ethotoin), or MESANTOIN (mephenytoin). EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: spl_medguide: Have had liver problems from taking phenytoin. Take delavirdine. Before taking 
extended phenytoin sodium capsules, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior 
Have had an allergic reaction to a medicine similar to extended phenytoin sodium capsules called carboxamides, barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones Have or had liver or kidney problems 
Have or had an enzyme problem called porphyria Have or had high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) Drink alcohol Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may harm your 
unborn baby. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: spl_medguide: If you become pregnant while 
taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of extended phenytoin
sodium capsules. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby
medicine to prevent this. All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If you are of 
childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Pregnancy Registry: If you become 
pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
spl_medguide: You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Are 
breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Phenytoin can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take extended phenytoin sodium capsules while you are 
breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. These medicines can change the 
levels of phenytoin in your blood. Taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules with certain other medicines can cause side effects or affect how well they work. Do not start or stop other medicines 
without talking to your healthcare provider. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take 
extended phenytoin sodium capsules? EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: spl_medguide: Take extended phenytoin sodium capsules exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Your healthcare provider will tell 
you how much extended phenytoin sodium capsules to take and when to take it. Your healthcare provider may change your dose if needed. Do not change your dose of extended phenytoin sodium capsules 
without talking to your healthcare provider. Do not stop taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping extended phenytoin sodium capsules 
suddenly can cause serious problems. What should I avoid while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Do not drink alcohol while you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking 
to your healthcare provider. Drinking alcohol while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules may change your blood levels of phenytoin which can cause serious problems. Do not drive, operate heavy 
machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how extended phenytoin sodium capsules affects you.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: dosage_and_administration: 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided 
doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6
years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level 
determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just 
prior to the patient’s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual’s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. 
EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: dosage_and_administration: Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound 
phenytoin concentrations between 1 and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or 
hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant . With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to 
achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
dosage_and_administration: 4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in Phenytoin-125 Suspension and Phenytoin Infatabs. Phenytoin extended capsules and 
parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage 
adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN 
SODIUM: dosage_and_administration: 5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic 
disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients  . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased 
slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered 
phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin dosage should be adjusted as necessary. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN 
SODIUM: dosage_and_administration: Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of 
phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic 
Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin sodium. Some of these events have been fatal or 
life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, 
nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, 
other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not 
evident. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued if an alternative
etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin sodium and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity  . 
Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same 
patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin sodium. 5. 
EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin sodium-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses
and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity  . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in 
patients treated with phenytoin sodium in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling 
occur. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including 
infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin sodium. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in
isolation . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges
from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications 
Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, 
agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between 
phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s disease. Although a cause and effect 
relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur
with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS  . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control 
using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, 
osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures.

Epilepticus  Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  Serious Dermatologic Reactions  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity  Hypersensitivity  Cardiac 
Effects  Angioedema  Hepatic Injury  Hematopoietic Complications  Effects on Vitamin D and Bone  Exacerbation of Porphyria  Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn  Hyperglycemia [ see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported 
voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
adverse_reactions: Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema  . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There 
have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis,
liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been 
reported in association with administration of phenytoin. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and 
pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including 
benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s disease have been reported  . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease 
serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may 
also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [ see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions 
and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor 
twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those 
induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs.
