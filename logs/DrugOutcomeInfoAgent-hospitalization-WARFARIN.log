[32mThe final answer to the question [0m[32m"Does WARFARIN increase or decrease the risk of hospitalization?"[0m[32m is that WARFARIN does not directly increase or decrease the risk of hospitalization. The risk of [0m
[32mhospitalization may be influenced by the management of the drug and the prevention of complications such as major bleeding events and thromboembolism. Regular monitoring and appropriate management are[0m
[32messential to minimize these risks. This information is based on the response from FDAHandler, which referenced the WARFARIN label and clinical studies showing the association between warfarin therapy [0m
