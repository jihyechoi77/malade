CONTENT: AMBISOME: clinical_studies: The following table presents a comparison of efficacy rates among immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients infected in the Mediterranean basin who had no 
prior treatment or remote prior treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. Efficacy is expressed as both acute parasite clearance at the end of therapy (EOT) and as overall success (clearance with no 
relapse) during the follow-up period (F/U) of greater than 6 months for immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients: AmBisome Efficacy in Visceral Leishmaniasis Immunocompetent Patients No. of 
Patients Parasite (%) Clearance at EOT Overall Success (%) at F/U 87 86/87 (98.9) 83/86 (96.5) Immunocompromised Patients Regimen Total Dose Parasite (%) Clearance at EOT Overall Success (%) at F/U

followed for 6 months or more after treatment, the overall success rate among immunocompetent patients was 96.5% and the overall success rate among immunocompromised patients was 11.8% due to relapse 
in the majority of patients. While case reports have suggested there may be a role for long-term therapy to prevent relapses in HIV coinfected patients (Lopez-Dupla, et al. AMBISOME: clinical_studies:
J Antimicrob Chemother 1993; 32: 657-659), there are no data to date documenting the efficacy or safety of repeat courses of Am B isome or of maintenance therapy with this drug among immunocompromised
patients.

B success rates. A negative value is in favor of amphotericin B. A positive value is in favor of Am B isome. Success at 10 weeks was defined as clinical success at week 10 plus CSF culture conversion 
at or prior to week 10. Success rates at 10 weeks in patients with positive baseline culture for cryptococcus species are summarized in the following table and show that the efficacy of Am B isome 6 
mg/kg/day approximates the efficacy of the amphotericin B deoxycholate regimen. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: These data do not support the conclusion that Am B isome 3 mg/kg/day is comparable in 
efficacy to amphotericin B deoxycholate. The table also presents 10-week survival rates for patients treated in this study. Success Rates and Survival Rates at Week 10, Study 94-0-013 (see text for 
definitions) AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day AmBisome 6 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.7 mg/kg/day Success in patients with documented cryptococcal meningitis 27/73 (37%) 97.5% CI* = -33.7%, +2.4% 42/85 (49%) 97.5% 
CI* = -20.9%, +14.5% 40/76 (53%) Survival rates 74/86 (86%) 97.5% CI* = -13.8%, +8. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: 9% 85/94 (90%) 97.5% CI* = -8.3%, +12.2% 77/87 (89%) * 97.5% Confidence Interval for the
difference between Am B isome and amphotericin B rates. A negative value is in favor of amphotericin B. A positive value is in favor of Am B isome. The incidence of infusion-related, cardiovascular 
and renal adverse events was lower in patients receiving Am B isome compared to amphotericin B deoxycholate (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section for details); therefore, the risks and benefits (advantages 
and disadvantages) of the different amphotericin B formulations should be taken into consideration when selecting a patient treatment regimen. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Treatment of Patients with 
Aspergillus Species, Candida Species and/or Cryptococcus Species Infections Refractory to Amphotericin B Deoxycholate, or in Patients Where Renal Impairment or Unacceptable Toxicity Precludes the Use 
of Amphotericin B Deoxycholate Am B isome was evaluated in a compassionate use study in hospitalized patients with systemic fungal infections. These patients either had fungal infections refractory to
amphotericin B deoxycholate, were intolerant to the use of amphotericin B deoxycholate, or had pre-existing renal insufficiency. Patient recruitment involved 140 infectious episodes in 133 patients, 
with 53 episodes evaluable for mycological response and 91 episodes evaluable for clinical outcome. Clinical success and mycological eradication occurred in some patients with documented 
aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis Am B isome was studied in patients with visceral leishmaniasis who were infected in the 
Mediterranean basin with documented or presumed Leishmania infantum . Clinical studies have not provided conclusive data regarding efficacy against L. donovani or L. chagasi . Am B isome achieved high
rates of acute parasite clearance in immunocompetent patients when total doses of 12-30 mg/kg were administered. Most of these immunocompetent patients remained relapse-free during follow-up periods 
of 6 months or longer. While acute parasite clearance was achieved in most of the immunocompromised patients who received total doses of 30-40 mg/kg, the majority of these patients were observed to 
relapse in the 6 months following the completion of therapy. Of the 21 immunocompromised patients studied, 17 were coinfected with HIV; approximately half of the HIV-infected patients had AIDS.

reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with Am B isome administration; on occasion this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the 
reaction developed within a few minutes after the start of infusion and disappeared rapidly when the infusion was stopped. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: The symptoms do not occur with every dose and 
usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse 
events also have been reported in 2% to 10% of Am B isome-treated patients receiving chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, or who had HIV disease in six comparative, clinical trials: Body as a 
Whole Abdomen enlarged, allergic reaction, cellulitis, cell-mediated immunological reaction, face edema, graft-versus-host disease, malaise, neck pain, and procedural complication. Cardiovascular 
System Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiomegaly, hemorrhage, postural hypotension, valvular heart disease, vascular disorder, and vasodilatation (flushing).

Since the FDA label data is the source of information for this inquiry and it does not provide the necessary details, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question of whether AMBISOME increases
or decreases the risk of hospitalization. Therefore, my final answer is also DO-NOT-KNOW.

        Do one of the following:

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.
            DO NOT REPEAT your original message; ONLY specify the 
            `intended_recipient` via this tool/function-call.
        2. If you are ready to have the critic check your answer,
            do so with the `final_answer` tool/function, as I have requested.
        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
        else to say, you MUST EXIT IMMEDIATELY by stating that you are done
        with the usual code (as in #3).

2. FDAHandler responded with a DO-NOT-KNOW, indicating that the FDA label data does not specify information about the risk of hospitalization associated with AMBISOME.

        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

  "arguments": {
    "critique": "",
    "request": "feedback"
  }
}
*(orchestrator-hospitalization-AMBISOME)  Entity.AGENT  Entity.AGENT(  feedback) (=>          ) (X           )       (          ) Your reasoning is valid, no feedback was provided.
 (orchestrator-hospitalization-AMBISOME)  Entity.USER 
 (orchestrator-hospitalization-AMBISOME)  Entity.AGENT  Entity.AGENT(Entity.AGENT) (=>          ) (X           )       (          ) [CANNOT RESPOND]
*(orchestrator-hospitalization-AMBISOME)  Entity.LLM  Entity.LLM(          ) (=>          ) (X           )       (          ) <DONE> DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data does not specify whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization, and therefore I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
