                Passages:
                1. Drug METOPROLOL TARTRATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data does not specify whether METOPROLOL TARTRATE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this 
question. It is important to note that the absence of information in the FDA label data does not necessarily mean that there is no effect; it may simply indicate that the effect has not been 
sufficiently studied or reported to warrant inclusion in the label.
2. Drug LABETALOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for LABETALOL does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. While the label lists various gastrointestinal effects such as 
nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal ulcers or related hospitalization. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine
whether LABETALOL has an effect on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
3. Drug ATENOLOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ATENOLOL does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. While the label lists gastrointestinal effects such as diarrhea 
and nausea, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal ulcers or their potential to lead to hospitalization. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine if ATENOLOL has 
an effect on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.

                Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of
                gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passages provided for METOPROLOL TARTRATE, LABETALOL, and ATENOLOL, which are all beta blockers, indicate that the FDA labels for these drugs do not specify whether they increase or 
decrease the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
2. The absence of information in the FDA labels suggests that there has not been sufficient study or reporting on the relationship between these beta blockers and gastrointestinal ulcer 
hospitalization to warrant inclusion in the drug labels.
3. Without specific evidence from the FDA labels or other reliable sources, it is not possible to determine if the beta blocker category of drugs has a clear effect on the risk of gastrointestinal 
ulcer hospitalization.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the beta blocker category of drugs on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization based on the provided passages.
