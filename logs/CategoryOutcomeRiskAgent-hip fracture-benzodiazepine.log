                Passages:
                1. Drug LORAZEPAM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for Lorazepam does not specify information regarding the risk of hip fracture associated with its use. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to whether Lorazepam increases or 
decreases the risk of hip fracture based on FDA label data.
2. Drug DIAZEPAM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data does not specify whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture, and therefore I cannot provide a definitive answer based on this data.
3. Drug CLONAZEPAM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for CLONAZEPAM does not provide a direct answer regarding the impact of clonazepam on the risk of hip fracture. It does list "fracture traumatic" as an infrequent adverse event reported 
by patients treated with clonazepam tablets during clinical trials, which occurs in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. However, this information does not specifically address the risk of hip fractures, nor 
does it establish a causal relationship between clonazepam use and fractures.
                ---------
                Does the benzodiazepine category of drugs increase the risk of
                hip fracture, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for Lorazepam does not specify information regarding the risk of hip fracture.
2. The FDA label data for Diazepam does not provide information on the risk of hip fracture.
3. The FDA label for Clonazepam mentions 'fracture traumatic' as an infrequent adverse event but does not establish a causal relationship with hip fractures or provide specific data on hip fracture 
risk.
4. Since none of the provided passages offer conclusive evidence regarding the effect of benzodiazepines on the risk of hip fracture, we cannot determine if the category as a whole has a clear effect 
on hip fracture risk.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the benzodiazepine category of drugs on the risk of hip fracture based on the provided passages.
