                Passages:
                1. Drug METOPROLOL TARTRATE: METOPROLOL TARTRATE decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. This conclusion is based on a large, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study 
mentioned in the METOPROLOL TARTRATE label, which showed that metoprolol reduced 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction when treated as soon as possible 
after their arrival in the hospital. The beneficial effects were observed with both intravenous and oral administration of metoprolol.
2. Drug LABETALOL: Labetalol does not appear to directly increase or decrease the risk of myocardial infarction. However, there is a reported risk of myocardial infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias
following abrupt discontinuation of labetalol in patients with coronary artery disease. This relationship is not clearly established and is based on reports of adverse reactions. The information is 
sourced from the LABETALOL label provided by FDAHandler.
3. Drug ATENOLOL: ATENOLOL decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which states that ATENOLOL is indicated for the treatment of 
hypertension and is used to lower blood pressure, thereby lowering the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarctions. Additionally, ATENOLOL is used to reduce 
cardiovascular mortality in hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction. Clinical trials have demonstrated that ATENOLOL improves survival in patients with 
myocardial infarction and provides other clinical benefits such as reduced frequency of ventricular premature beats, reduced chest pain, and reduced enzyme elevation.

                Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of
                myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that METOPROLOL TARTRATE, a beta blocker, decreases the risk of myocardial infarction based on a large, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study.
2. Passage 2 states that LABETALOL, another beta blocker, does not directly increase or decrease the risk of myocardial infarction, but there is a risk associated with abrupt discontinuation in 
patients with coronary artery disease.
3. Passage 3 reports that ATENOLOL, also a beta blocker, decreases the risk of myocardial infarction, as supported by clinical trials and FDAHandler information.
4. The evidence from passages 1 and 3 strongly suggests that beta blockers, as a category, decrease the risk of myocardial infarction. Passage 2 does not contradict this finding but rather indicates a
potential risk associated with discontinuation of the drug rather than its use.
        -----
        Final answer: The beta blocker category of drugs decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.
