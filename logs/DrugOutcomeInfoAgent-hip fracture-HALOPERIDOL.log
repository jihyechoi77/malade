[31mappears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely[0m

[31mnot be used since haloperidol may block its vasopressor activity and paradoxical further lowering of the blood pressure may occur. Instead, metaraminol, phenylephrine or norepinephrine should be used.[0m
[31m-receiving anticonvulsant medications, with a history of seizures, or with EEG abnormalities, because haloperidol may lower the convulsive threshold. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: If indicated, adequate [0m
[31manticonvulsant therapy should be concomitantly maintained. -with known allergies, or with a history of allergic reactions to drugs. -receiving anticoagulants, since an isolated instance of [0m
[31minterference occurred with the effects of one anticoagulant [0m[1;31m([0m[31mphenindione[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m. If concomitant antiparkinson medication is required, it may have to be continued after haloperidol is discontinued because of[0m
[31mthe difference in excretion rates. If both are discontinued simultaneously, extrapyramidal symptoms may occur. The physician should keep in mind the possible increase in intraocular pressure when [0m
[31manticholinergic drugs, including antiparkinson agents, are administered concomitantly with haloperidol. As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that haloperidol may be capable of [0m
[31mpotentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: In a study of [0m[1;31m12[0m[31m schizophrenic patients coadministered haloperidol and rifampin, plasma haloperidol [0m
[31mlevels were decreased by a mean of [0m[1;31m70[0m[31m% and mean scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were increased from baseline. In five other schizophrenic patients treated with haloperidol and rifampin, [0m
[31mdiscontinuation of rifampin produced a mean [0m[1;31m3.3[0m[31m-fold increase in haloperidol concentrations. Thus, careful monitoring of clinical status is warranted when rifampin is administered or discontinued in [0m
[31mhaloperidol-treated patients. When haloperidol is used to control mania in cyclic disorders, there may be a rapid mood swing to depression. Severe neurotoxicity [0m[1;31m([0m[31mrigidity, inability to walk or talk[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m [0m
[31mmay occur in patients with thyrotoxicosis who are also receiving antipsychotic medication, including haloperidol. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: No mutagenic potential of haloperidol was found in the Ames [0m
[31mSalmonella microsomal activation assay. Negative or inconsistent positive findings have been obtained in in vitro and in vivo studies of effects of haloperidol on chromosome structure and number. The [0m
[31mavailable cytogenetic evidence is considered too inconsistent to be conclusive at this time. Carcinogenicity studies using oral haloperidol were conducted in Wistar rats [0m[1;31m([0m[31mdosed at up to [0m[1;31m5[0m[31m mg/kg daily [0m

In the rat study, survival was less than optimal in all dose groups, reducing the number of rats at risk for [0m
[31mdeveloping tumors. However, although a relatively greater number of rats survived to the end of the study in high dose male and female groups, these animals did not have a greater incidence of tumors [0m
[31mthan control animals. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: Therefore, although not optimal, this study does suggest the absence of a haloperidol related increase in the incidence of neoplasia in rats at doses up[0m
[31mto [0m[1;31m20[0m[31m times the usual daily human dose for chronic or resistant patients. In female mice at [0m[1;31m5[0m[31m and [0m[1;31m20[0m[31m times the highest initial daily dose for chronic or resistant patients, there was a statistically [0m
[31msignificant increase in mammary gland neoplasia and total tumor incidence; at [0m[1;31m20[0m[31m times the same daily dose there was a statistically significant increase in pituitary gland neoplasia. In male mice, no[0m
[31mstatistically significant differences in incidences of total tumors or specific tumor types were noted. Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic [0m
[31madministration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these[0m
[31mdrugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been [0m
[31mreported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of [0m
[31mantipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; [0m
[31mthe available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. There are no well controlled studies with haloperidol in pregnant women. There are reports, however, of cases of limb [0m
[31mmalformations observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy. Causal relationships were not [0m
[31mestablished in these cases. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, this drug should be used during pregnancy or in women [0m
[31mlikely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus. Infants should not be nursed during drug treatment. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric [0m
[31mpatients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of haloperidol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged [0m[1;31m65[0m[31m and over to determine whether they respond differently from [0m

[31mDyskinesia A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome [0m
[31mappears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely[0m
[31mto develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it[0m

[31mdevelop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. HALOPERIDOL: warnings: There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although [0m
[31mthe syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress [0m[1;31m([0m[31mor partially suppress[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m the signs and symptoms of the [0m

[31mthe difference in excretion rates. If both are discontinued simultaneously, extrapyramidal symptoms may occur. The physician should keep in mind the possible increase in intraocular pressure when [0m
[31manticholinergic drugs, including antiparkinson agents, are administered concomitantly with haloperidol. As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that haloperidol may be capable of [0m
[31mpotentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: In a study of [0m[1;31m12[0m[31m schizophrenic patients coadministered haloperidol and rifampin, plasma haloperidol [0m
[31mlevels were decreased by a mean of [0m[1;31m70[0m[31m% and mean scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were increased from baseline. In five other schizophrenic patients treated with haloperidol and rifampin, [0m
[31mdiscontinuation of rifampin produced a mean [0m[1;31m3.3[0m[31m-fold increase in haloperidol concentrations. Thus, careful monitoring of clinical status is warranted when rifampin is administered or discontinued in [0m
[31mhaloperidol-treated patients. When haloperidol is used to control mania in cyclic disorders, there may be a rapid mood swing to depression. Severe neurotoxicity [0m[1;31m([0m[31mrigidity, inability to walk or talk[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m [0m

[31mSalmonella microsomal activation assay. Negative or inconsistent positive findings have been obtained in in vitro and in vivo studies of effects of haloperidol on chromosome structure and number. The [0m
