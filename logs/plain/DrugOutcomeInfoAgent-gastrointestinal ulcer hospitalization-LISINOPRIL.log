CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been evaluated for safety in 930 patients including 100 patients treated for 50 weeks or more.
In clinical trials with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets no adverse experiences peculiar to this combination drug have been observed. Adverse experiences that have occurred have been limited
to those that have been previously reported with lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide. The most frequent clinical adverse experiences in controlled trials (including open label extensions) with any 
combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets were: dizziness (7.5%), headache (5.2%), cough (3.9%), fatigue (3.7%) and orthostatic effects (3.2%) all of which were more common than in 
placebo-treated patients. Generally, adverse experiences were mild and transient in nature; but see WARNINGS regarding angioedema and excessive hypotension or syncope. LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: 
Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects was required in 4.4% of patients principally because of dizziness, cough, fatigue and muscle cramps. Adverse experiences occurring in greater than one
percent of patients treated with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide in controlled clinical trials are shown below. Percent of Patients in Controlled Studies Clinical adverse experiences occurring in 
0.3% to 1.0% of patients in controlled trials included: Lisinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide (n=930) Incidence (discontinuation) Placebo (n=207) Incidence Dizziness 7.5 (0.8) 1.9 Headache 5.2 (0.3) 1.9

adverse_reactions: 0 Body as a Whole: Chest pain, abdominal pain, syncope, chest discomfort, fever, trauma, virus infection. Cardiovascular: Palpitation, orthostatic hypotension. Digestive: 
Gastrointestinal cramps, dry mouth, constipation, heartburn. Musculoskeletal: Back pain, shoulder pain, knee pain, back strain, myalgia, foot pain. Nervous/Psychiatric: Decreased libido, vertigo, 
depression, somnolence. Respiratory: Common cold, nasal congestion, influenza, bronchitis, pharyngeal pain, dyspnea, pulmonary congestion, chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, pharyngeal discomfort. 
Skin: Flushing, pruritus, skin inflammation, diaphoresis. Special Senses: Blurred vision, tinnitus, otalgia. Urogenital: Urinary tract infection. LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Angioedema: Angioedema 
has been reported in patients receiving PRINZIDE, with an incidence higher in Black than in non-Black patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face, 
extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx occurs, treatment with PRINZIDE should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. In rare cases, intestinal angioedema has been 
reported with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors including lisinopril. (See WARNINGS ). Hypotension: In clinical trials, adverse effects relating to hypotension occurred as follows: hypotension 
(1.4 percent), orthostatic hypotension (0.5 percent), other orthostatic effects (3.2 percent). In addition syncope occurred in 0.8 percent of patients (See WARNINGS ). LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: 
Cough: See PRECAUTIONS - Cough . Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes: (See PRECAUTIONS ). Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor reversible increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum 
creatinine were observed in patients with essential hypertension treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. More marked increases have also been reported and were more likely to occur in
patients with renal artery stenosis (See PRECAUTIONS ). Serum Uric Acid, Glucose, Magnesium, Cholesterol, Triglycerides and Calcium: (See PRECAUTIONS ). Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: Small decreases in 
hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases of approximately 0.5 g% and 1.5 vol%, respectively) occurred frequently in hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets but 
were rarely of clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexisted. LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: In clinical trials, 0.4% of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia. Liver Function 
Tests: Rarely, elevations of liver enzymes and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. (See WARNINGS, Hepatic Failure ). Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the individual components are 
listed below: Lisinopril - In clinical trials adverse reactions which occurred with lisinopril were also seen with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: In 
addition, and since lisinopril has been marketed, the following adverse reactions have been reported with lisinopril and should be considered potential adverse reactions for lisinopril and 
hydrochlorothiazide tablets: Body as a Whole: Anaphylactoid reactions (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions ), malaise, edema, facial edema, pain, pelvic pain, flank pain, 
chills; Cardiovascular: Cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident, possibly secondary to excessive hypotension in high risk patients (see WARNINGS, Hypotension ), pulmonary 
embolism and infarction, worsening of heart failure, arrhythmias (including tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, and premature ventricular 
contractions), angina pectoris, transient ischemic attacks LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, decreased blood pressure, peripheral edema, vasculitis; Digestive:

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations occur within about 7 hours. Declining serum concentrations
exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose. Lisinopril does not
appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent of absorption of 
lisinopril is approximately 25 percent, with large intersubject variability (6% to 60%) at all doses tested (5 mg to 80 mg). Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the 
gastrointestinal tract. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours. LISINOPRIL: pharmacokinetics: Impaired renal function decreases elimination of 
lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this glomerular 
filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to attain 
steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients. (See DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION ) Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in 
accumulation in any tissues. However, milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14 C lisinopril. LISINOPRIL: pharmacokinetics: By whole body autoradiography, 
radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: 1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15 percent of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately six percent had a decrease greater than 0.5 
mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS .) ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that 
degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through 
which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension.
LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average 
response to lisinopril monotherapy than non-Black patients. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations occur within about 7 hours. Declining
serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to 
dose. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent
of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25 percent, with large intersubject variability (6% to 60%) at all doses tested (5 mg to 80 mg). LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Lisinopril absorption 
is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours. Impaired renal function decreases
elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this 
glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Multiple 
doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues. However, milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14 C lisinopril. By whole body 
autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses. Pharmacodynamics Administration of lisinopril to 
patients with hypertension results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not 
observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients. (See WARNINGS .) In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour 
after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six hours. LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: In some patients achievement of optimal 
blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy. At recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours, after dosing, although the 
effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect six hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril
has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood 
pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following 
administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical studies of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether 
they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for 
an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant 
disease or other drug therapy. In a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study in elderly versus young hypertensive patients using the lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination, area under the plasma 
concentration time curve (AUC) increased approximately 120% for lisinopril and approximately 80% for hydrochlorothiazide in older patients. LISINOPRIL: geriatric_use: This drug is known to be 
substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased 
renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.
