        -----
        
CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: Other Cardiovascular Agents Enalapril maleate has been used concomitantly with beta adrenergic-blocking agents, methyldopa, nitrates, calcium-blocking 
agents, hydralazine, prazosin and digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Enalapril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type
diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum 
potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. 
Potassium-sparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure receiving enalapril maleate. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: Lithium Lithium toxicity has been reported in 
patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. A few cases of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant 
enalapril maleate and lithium and were reversible upon discontinuation of both drugs. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if enalapril is administered concomitantly 
with lithium. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium 
aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including enalapril maleate. mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) Inhibitors Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR 
inhibitor (e.g. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ).         
SOURCE:ENALAPRIL MALEATE label


CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: Cardiovascular Cardiac arrest; myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident, possibly secondary to excessive hypotension in high risk patients (see 
WARNINGS, Hypotension ); pulmonary embolism and infarction; pulmonary edema; rhythm disturbances including atrial tachycardia and bradycardia; atrial fibrillation; palpitation, Raynaud's phenomenon. 
Digestive Ileus, pancreatitis, hepatic failure, hepatitis (hepatocellular  or cholestatic jaundice) (see WARNINGS, Hepatic Failure ), melena, anorexia, dyspepsia, constipation, glossitis, stomatitis, 
dry mouth. Hematologic Rare cases of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and bone marrow depression. Musculoskeletal Muscle cramps. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: Nervous/Psychiatric Depression, 
confusion, ataxia, somnolence, insomnia, nervousness, peripheral neuropathy (e.g., paresthesia, dysesthesia), dream abnormality. Respiratory Bronchospasm, rhinorrhea, sore throat and hoarseness, 
asthma, upper respiratory infection, pulmonary infiltrates, eosinophilic pneumonitis. Skin Exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, pemphigus, herpes zoster, 
erythema multiforme, urticaria, pruritus, alopecia, flushing, diaphoresis, photosensitivity. Special Senses Blurred vision, taste alteration, anosmia, tinnitus, conjunctivitis, dry eyes, tearing. 
ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: Urogenital Renal failure, oliguria, renal dysfunction (see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ), flank pain, gynecomastia, impotence. Miscellaneous A 
symptom complex has been reported which may include some or all of the following: a positive ANA, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, arthralgia/arthritis, myalgia/myositis, fever, serositis, 
vasculitis, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, photosensitivity, rash and other dermatologic manifestations. Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving enalapril maleate, with an incidence
higher in black than in non-black patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: If angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis
and/or larynx occurs, treatment with enalapril maleate should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ). Hypotension In the hypertensive 
patients, hypotension occurred in 0.9 percent and syncope occurred in 0.5 percent of patients following the initial dose or during extended therapy. Hypotension or syncope was a cause for 
discontinuation of therapy in 0.1 percent of hypertensive patients. In heart failure patients, hypotension occurred in 6.7 percent and syncope occurred in 2.2 percent of patients. Hypotension or 
syncope was a cause for discontinuation of therapy in 1.9 percent of patients with heart failure (see WARNINGS, Hypotension ). Cough See PRECAUTIONS, Cough . ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: 
Pediatric Patients The adverse experience profile for pediatric patients appears to be similar to that seen in adult patients. Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes Hyperkalemia (see 
PRECAUTIONS, Hyperkalemia ), hyponatremia. Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen In controlled clinical trials minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, reversible upon discontinuation of
therapy, were observed in about 0.2 percent of patients with essential hypertension treated with enalapril maleate alone. Increases are more likely to occur in patients receiving concomitant diuretics
or in patients with renal artery stenosis (see PRECAUTIONS, Impaired Renal Function ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: adverse_reactions: In patients with heart failure who were also receiving diuretics with or 
without digitalis, increases in blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine, usually reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril maleate and/or other concomitant diuretic therapy, were observed in about 
11 percent of patients. Increases in blood urea nitrogen or creatinine were a cause for discontinuation in 1.2 percent of patients. Hematology Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean 
decreases of approximately 0.3 g percent and 1 vol percent, respectively) occur frequently in either hypertension or congestive heart failure patients treated with enalapril maleate but are rarely of 
clinical importance unless another cause of anemia coexists. In clinical trials, less than 0.1 percent of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia.

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are
effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate and thiazides are approximately 
additive. Heart Failure Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients 
enalapril maleate improves symptoms, increases survival, and decreases the frequency of hospitalization (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of 
survival trials). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 
≤35 percent), enalapril maleate tablets, USP decreases the rate of development of overt heart failure and decreases the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart
Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of survival trials). In using enalapril maleate, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 
captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that enalapril maleate does not 
have a similar risk (see WARNINGS , Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: In considering use of enalapril maleate, it should be noted that in controlled clinical 
trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, it should be noted that black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been 
reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ).

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Angioedema Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur at any time during treatment with angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril. Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, 
difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to take no more drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician. Hypotension Patients should be cautioned to report lightheadedness, especially
during the first few days of therapy. If actual syncope occurs, the patients should be told to discontinue the drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician. All patients should be 
cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: information_for_patients: Other causes of
volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult with the physician. Hyperkalemia Patients should be told not to use salt 
substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician. Neutropenia Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever) which may be a sign 
of neutropenia. Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to enalapril maleate during pregnancy. Discuss treatment options with women planning to 
become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. NOTE: As with many other drugs, certain advice to patients being treated with enalapril is 
warranted. This information is intended to aid in the safe and effective use of this medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects.

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: WARNINGS Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and 
polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including enalapril maleate) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck 
Angioedema Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril maleate. 
This may occur at any time during treatment. In such cases enalapril maleate should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained 
resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: In instances where swelling has been confined to the face and lips the condition has generally resolved without treatment, 
although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause 
airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway, should be promptly provided (see ADVERSE
REACTIONS ). Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may 
be at increased risk for angioedema (see PRECAUTIONS ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These 
patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was 
diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential 
diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving 
an ACE inhibitor (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while 
receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily 
withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes 
and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension 
Excessive hypotension is rare in uncomplicated hypertensive patients treated with enalapril maleate alone. Patients with heart failure given enalapril maleate commonly have some reduction in blood 
pressure, especially with the first dose, but discontinuation of therapy for continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed; caution should be 
observed when initiating therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Patients at risk for excessive hypotension, sometimes associated with oliguria and/or progressive 
azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death, include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure, hyponatremia, high-dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive 
diuresis or increase in diuretic dose, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology. It may be advisable to eliminate the diuretic (except in patients with heart failure), 
reduce the diuretic dose or increase salt intake cautiously before initiating therapy with enalapril maleate in patients at risk for excessive hypotension who are able to tolerate such adjustments 
(see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS ).

The final answer to the question "Does ENALAPRIL MALEATE increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?" is that ENALAPRIL MALEATE increases the risk of angioedema. This information is based on the 
response from FDAHandler, which referenced the ENALAPRIL MALEATE label indicating that angioedema has been reported in patients receiving the drug. The incidence is higher in black patients compared 
to non-black patients, and angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If angioedema occurs, treatment with ENALAPRIL MALEATE should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted 
immediately.
