CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: warnings: ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association 
with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or 
blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. The 
diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness
(e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). PIMOZIDE: warnings: Other important considerations in the differential 
diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of 
antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for 
which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after
recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Hyperpyrexia, 
not associated with the above symptom complex, has been reported with other antipsychotic drugs. Other Sudden, unexpected deaths have occurred in experimental studies of conditions other than 
Tourette’s Disorder. PIMOZIDE: warnings: These deaths occurred while patients were receiving dosages in the range of 1 mg per kg. One possible mechanism for such deaths is prolongation of the QT 
interval predisposing patients to ventricular arrhythmia. An electrocardiogram should be performed before pimozide treatment is initiated and periodically thereafter, especially during the period of 
dose adjustment. Pimozide may have a tumorigenic potential. Based on studies conducted in mice, it is known that pimozide can produce a dose-related increase in pituitary tumors. The full significance
of this finding is not known, but should be taken into consideration in the physician’s and patient’s decisions to use this drug product. This finding should be given special consideration when the 
patient is young and chronic use of pimozide is anticipated (see PRECAUTIONS - Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ).

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: precautions: The concentrations observed in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers are similar to those seen with strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine. The time to achieve steady state 
Pimozide concentrations is expected to be longer (approximately 2 weeks) in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers because of the prolonged half-life. Alternative dosing strategies are recommended in patients who 
are genetically poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ). Interaction with Food Patients should avoid grapefruit juice because it may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4. 
CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, pimozide causes a dose-related increase in pituitary and mammary tumors. 
PIMOZIDE: precautions: When mice were treated for up to 18 months with pimozide, pituitary gland changes developed in females only. These changes were characterized as hyperplasia at doses 
approximating the human dose and adenoma at doses about fifteen times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg per kg basis. The mechanism for the induction of pituitary tumors in mice is not known.
Mammary gland tumors in female mice were also increased, but these tumors are expected in rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs which elevate prolactin levels. Chronic administration of an 
antipsychotic also causes elevated prolactin levels in humans. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of 
potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, 
amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clinical studies
nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis. The available evidence, however, is considered too 
limited to be conclusive at this time. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, animals received up to 50 times the maximum recommended human dose. No increased incidence of overall tumors or 
tumors at any site was observed in either sex. Because of the limited number of animals surviving this study, the meaning of these results is unclear. Pimozide did not have mutagenic activity in the 
Ames test with four bacterial test strains, in the mouse dominant lethal test or in the micronucleus test in rats. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Reproduction studies in animals were not adequate to assess 
all aspects of fertility. Nevertheless, female rats administered pimozide had prolonged estrus cycles, an effect also produced by other antipsychotic drugs. PREGNANCY Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy 
Category C. Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 8 times the maximum human dose did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity. In the rat, however, this multiple of the 
human dose resulted in decreased pregnancies and in the retarded development of fetuses. These effects are thought to be due to an inhibition or delay in implantation which is also observed in rodents
administered other antipsychotic drugs. In the rabbit, maternal toxicity, mortality, decreased weight gain, and embryotoxicity including increased resorptions were dose-related. PIMOZIDE: precautions:
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, pimozide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the potential
risks. Nonteratogenic effects. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have
been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases 
symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Pimozide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus. LABOR & DELIVERY This drug has no recognized use in labor or delivery.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE In general, the signs and symptoms of overdosage with pimozide would be an exaggeration of known pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions, the most 
prominent of which would be: 1) electrocardiographic abnormalities, 2) severe extrapyramidal reactions, 3) hypotension, 4) a comatose state with respiratory depression. In the event of overdosage, 
gastric lavage, establishment of a patent airway and, if necessary, mechanically-assisted respiration are advised. Electrocardiographic monitoring should commence immediately and continue until the 
ECG parameters are within the normal range. Hypotension and circulatory collapse may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated albumin, and vasopressor agents such as 
metaraminol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine should not be used. PIMOZIDE: overdosage: In case of severe extrapyramidal reactions, antiparkinson medication should be administered. 
Because of the long half-life of pimozide, patients who take an overdose should be observed for at least 4 days. As with all drugs, the physician should consider contacting a poison control center for
additional information on the treatment of overdose.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Treatment with pimozide tablets, USP exposes the patient to serious risks. A decision to use pimozide tablets, USP chronically in 
Tourette’s Disorder is one that deserves full consideration by the patient (or patient’s family) as well as by the treating physician. Because the goal of treatment is symptomatic improvement, the 
patient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary 
source of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only 
for use in patients with Tourette’s Disorder whose symptoms are severe and who cannot tolerate, or who do not respond to HALDOL ® (haloperidol). PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Given the 
likelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if 
possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to 
understand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under 12 years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP 
from foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed
that all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected 
deaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the 
heart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.
Also, pimozide, at a dose about 15 times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. 
Similar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the 
drug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.
