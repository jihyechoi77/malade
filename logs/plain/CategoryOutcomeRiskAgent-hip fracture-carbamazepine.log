                1. Drug CARBAMAZEPINE: The FDA label for CARBAMAZEPINE does not specifically mention an increased or decreased risk of hip fracture. However, it does note that carbamazepine can cause 
bone loss and decreased levels of plasma calcium, which can lead to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a known risk factor for fractures, including hip fractures. Therefore, while not directly stated, 
there is an implication that carbamazepine may potentially increase the risk of hip fractures due to its effects on bone health.
                ---------
                Does the carbamazepine category of drugs increase the risk of
                hip fracture, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
