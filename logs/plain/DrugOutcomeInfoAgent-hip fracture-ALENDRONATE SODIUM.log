CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the 
bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled 
during bone turnover. Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of 
low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females 
but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: These changes
result in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to 
age 90, the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or 
more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. 
ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent 
inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). 
These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. 
Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides 
of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: Similar decreases were seen 
in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3
to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of 
bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In 
osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively.

bone mass in men with osteoporosis ( 1.2 ) Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years 
of use ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of 
osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .] 1.

Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All
patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 
to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

ANSWER: Alendronate sodium is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis. It works by binding to bone hydroxyapatite and 
specifically inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. By reducing bone resorption and ultimately affecting bone formation due to the coupling of these processes during bone 
turnover, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures).

ALENDRONATE SODIUM decreases the risk of hip fracture. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which indicates that ALENDRONATE SODIUM is used for the treatment of osteoporosis and 
works by inhibiting osteoclast activity, leading to an increase in bone mass and a reduction in the incidence of fractures, including hip fractures.
