CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may 
be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. Information 
for Patients Advise patients to take metoprolol regularly and continuously, as directed, with or immediately following meals. If a dose should be missed, the patient should take only the next 
scheduled dose (without doubling it). Patients should not discontinue metoprolol without consulting the physician. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: Advise patients (1) to avoid operating automobiles 
and machinery or engaging in other tasks requiring alertness until the patient’s response to therapy with metoprolol has been determined; (2) to contact the physician if any difficulty in breathing 
occurs; (3) to inform the physician or dentist before any type of surgery that he or she is taking metoprolol. Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting Drugs: Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., 
reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Observe patients treated with metoprolol plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence 
of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: In addition, possibly significant hypertension may theoretically 
occur up to 14 days following discontinuation of the concomitant administration with an irreversible MAO inhibitor. Digitalis Glycosides and Beta-blockers: Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers 
slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and PR interval. Calcium Channel Blockers: Concomitant administration
of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. CYP2D6 Inhibitors: 
Potent inhibitors of the CYP2D6 enzyme may increase the plasma concentration of metoprolol which would mimic the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (see Pharmacokinetics section). Increase in
plasma concentrations of metoprolol would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Known clinically significant potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 are 
antidepressants such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, clomipramine, and desipramine; antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and thioridazine; 
antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propafenone; antiretrovirals such as ritonavir; antihistamines such as diphenhydramine; antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or quinidine; antifungals such as 
terbinafine. Hydralazine: Concomitant administration of hydralazine may inhibit presystemic metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: 
drug_interactions: Alpha-adrenergic Agents: Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine may be potentiated by 
beta-blockers including metoprolol. Beta-adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing reflex tachycardia. On the 
contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic blocker. If a patient is 
treated with clonidine and metoprolol concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, stop metoprolol several days before clonidine is withdrawn. Rebound hypertension that can follow 
withdrawal of clonidine may be increased in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting Drugs:

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Individualized the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken 
with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. Increase the dosage 
at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective 
dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: While once-daily dosing is 
effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period, and larger or more 
frequent daily doses may be required. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the
day. Beta 1 selectivity diminishes as the dose of metoprolol is increased. Angina Pectoris The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be 
taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until 
optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is pronounced slowing of the heart rate. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets 
is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, gradually decrease the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks (see WARNINGS ). 
Myocardial Infarction Early Treatment During the early phase of definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, initiate treatment with metoprolol tartrate tablets as soon as possible after the 
patient's arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient’s hemodynamic condition has stabilized. Begin treatment in this 
early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; give the injections at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous 
administration of metoprolol, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram.         
SOURCE:METOPROLOL TARTRATE label


CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the 
last intravenous dose and continue for 48 hours. Thereafter, the maintenance dosage is 100 mg twice daily (see Late Treatment below). Start patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous 
dose on metoprolol tartrate tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition 
allows. In patients with severe intolerance, discontinue metoprolol tartrate tablets (see WARNINGS ). METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: Late Treatment Start patients with 
contraindications to treatment during the early phase of suspected or definite myocardial infarction, patients who appear not to tolerate the full early treatment, and patients in whom the physician 
wishes to delay therapy for any other reason on metoprolol tartrate tablets, 100 mg twice daily, as soon as their clinical condition allows. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the 
efficacy of metoprolol beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years. Special 
Populations Pediatric Patients : No pediatric studies have been performed. The safety and efficacy of metoprolol tartrate tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. Renal Impairment : No
dose adjustment of metoprolol tartrate tablets is required in patients with renal impairment. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: Hepatic Impairment : Metoprolol blood levels are likely to
increase substantially in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, metoprolol tartrate tablets should be initiated at low doses with cautious gradual dose titration according to clinical response.
Geriatric Patients (>65 years) : In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant 
disease or other drug therapy. Method of Administration For oral treatment, the tablets should be swallowed un-chewed with a glass of water. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should always be taken in 
standardized relation with meals. If the physician asks the patient to take metoprolol tartrate tablets either before breakfast or with breakfast, then the patient should continue taking metoprolol 
with the same schedule during the course of therapy.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Pharmacokinetics Absorption The estimated oral bioavailability of immediate release metoprolol is about 50% because of pre-systemic metabolism which is 
saturable leading to non-proportionate increase in the exposure with increased dose. Distribution Metoprolol is extensively distributed with a reported volume of distribution of 3.2 to 5.6 L/kg. About
10% of metoprolol in plasma is bound to serum albumin. Metoprolol is known to cross the placenta and is found in breast milk. Metoprolol is also known to cross the blood brain barrier following oral 
administration and CSF concentrations close to that observed in plasma have been reported. Metoprolol is not a significant P-glycoprotein substrate. Metabolism Metoprolol is primarily metabolized by 
CYP2D6. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Metoprolol is a racemic mixture of R- and S- enantiomers, and when administered orally, it exhibits stereoselective metabolism that is dependent on 
oxidation phenotype. CYP2D6 is absent (poor metabolizers) in about 8% of Caucasians and about 2% of most other populations. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers exhibit several-fold higher plasma concentrations 
of metoprolol than extensive metabolizers with normal CYP2D6 activity thereby decreasing metoprolol’s cardioselectivity. Elimination Elimination of metoprolol is mainly by biotransformation in the 
liver. The mean elimination half-life of metoprolol is 3 to 4 hours; in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers the half-life may be 7 to 9 hours. Approximately 95% of the dose can be recovered in urine. METOPROLOL 
TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: In most subjects (extensive metabolizers), less than 5% of an oral dose and less than 10% of an intravenous dose are excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. In poor 
metabolizers, up to 30% or 40% of oral or intravenous doses, respectively, may be excreted unchanged; the rest is excreted by the kidneys as metabolites that appear to have no beta-blocking activity. 
The renal clearance of the stereo-isomers does not exhibit stereo-selectivity in renal excretion. Special Populations Geriatric Patients The geriatric population may show slightly higher plasma 
concentrations of metoprolol as a combined result of a decreased metabolism of the drug in elderly population and a decreased hepatic blood flow. However, this increase is not clinically significant 
or therapeutically relevant. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Renal Impairment The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically 
significant degree from those in normal subjects. Hepatic Impairment Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. The
elimination half-life of metoprolol is considerably prolonged, depending on severity (up to 7.2 h). Clinical Studies Hypertension In controlled clinical studies, metoprolol has been shown to be an 
effective antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics, at dosages of 100 to 450 mg daily. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: In controlled, 
comparative, clinical studies, metoprolol has been shown to be as effective an antihypertensive agent as propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, to be equally effective in supine and 
standing positions. Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials, metoprolol, administered two or four times daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina 
attacks and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. A controlled, comparative, clinical trial showed that metoprolol was indistinguishable from
propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Myocardial Infarction In a large (1,395 patients randomized), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, 
metoprolol was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in 
the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of
shock, and/or more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of metoprolol or placebo, given in a 
coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with metoprolol or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After this double-blind period, all patients were given metoprolol and followed 
up to 1 year. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the metoprolol- and placebo-treatment groups. Among 
patients treated with metoprolol, there were comparable reductions in 3-month mortality for those treated early (≤8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the 
incidence of ventricular fibrillation and in chest pain following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with metoprolol and were independent of the interval between onset of symptoms and 
initiation of therapy. In this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both very early (intra-venously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while placebo patients received no 
beta-blocker treatment for this period. The study thus was able to show a benefit from the overall metoprolol regimen but cannot separate the benefit of very early intravenous treatment from the 
benefit of later beta-blocker therapy. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Nonetheless, because the overall regimen showed a clear beneficial effect on survival without evidence of an early adverse
effect on survival, one acceptable dosage regimen is the precise regimen used in the trial. Because the specific benefit of very early treatment remains to be defined however, it is also reasonable to
administer the drug orally to patients at a later time as is recommended for certain other beta-blockers.

The FDA label for METOPROLOL TARTRATE does not indicate that the drug increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. The adverse reactions table and other sections of the label do not mention renal
failure as a known adverse effect or precaution. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to determine if METOPROLOL TARTRATE has an effect on the risk of renal failure.
