CONTENT: LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse effects are mild and transient and occur early in the course of treatment. In controlled clinical trials of 3 to 4 months' 
duration, discontinuation of labetalol hydrochloride tablets due to one or more adverse effects was required in 7% of all patients. In these same trials, other agents with solely beta-blocking 
activity used in the control groups led to discontinuation in 8% to 10% of patients, and a centrally acting alpha-agonist led to discontinuation in 30% of patients. The incidence rates of adverse 
reactions listed in the following table were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials comparing labetalol HCl, placebo, metoprolol, and propranolol over treatment periods of 3 and 4 
months. Where the frequency of adverse effects for labetalol HCl and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain. The rates are based on adverse reactions considered probably drug related by 
the investigator. LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: If all reports are considered, the rates are somewhat higher (e.g., dizziness, 20%; nausea, 14%; fatigue, 11%), but the overall conclusions are 
unchanged. LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: Labetalol HCI Placebo Propranolol Metoprolol (n = 227) (n = 98) (n = 84) (n = 49) % % % % Body as a whole Fatigue 5 0 12 12 Asthenia 1 1 1 0 Headache 2 1 1 2

patients with bronchospastic disease, overt congestive heart failure, or other contraindications to beta-blocker therapy. Clinical trials also included studies utilizing daily doses up to 2,400 mg in 
more severely hypertensive patients. LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: Certain of the side effects increased with increasing dose, as shown in the following table that depicts the entire U.S. therapeutic

CONTENT: LABETALOL: precautions: Also, transient scalp tingling may occur, usually when treatment with labetalol hydrochloride tabletsis initiated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Laboratory Tests As with 
any new drug given over prolonged periods, laboratory parameters should be observed over regular intervals. In patients with concomitant illnesses, such as impaired renal function, appropriate tests 
should be done to monitor these conditions. Drug Interactions In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking labetalol HCl in combination with tricyclic antidepressants experienced tremor, as compared to 0.7%
reported to occur with labetalol HCl alone. The contribution of each of the treatments to this adverse reaction is unknown, but the possibility of a drug interaction cannot be excluded. LABETALOL: 
precautions: Drugs possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of beta-receptor agonist drugs in patients with bronchospasm; therefore, doses greater than the normal 
antiasthmatic dose of beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs may be required. Cimetidine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of labetalol HCl. Since this could be explained either by enhanced 
absorption or by an alteration of hepatic metabolism of labetalol HCl, special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients. Synergism has been 
shown between halothane anesthesia and intravenously administered labetalol HCl. LABETALOL: precautions: During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using labetalol HCl in association with halothane, 
high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an 
increase in central venous pressure. The anesthesiologist should be informed when a patient is receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol HCl blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without 
preventing its hypotensive effect. If labetalol HCl is used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional antihypertensive effects may occur. Care should be taken if labetalol is 
used concomitantly with calcium antagonists of the verapamil type. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. LABETALOL: precautions: 
comitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be 
more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. Drug & OR 
Laboratory Test Interactions The presence of labetalol metabolites in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary catecholamines, metanephrine, normetanephrine, and vanillylmandelic 
acid when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods. In screening patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma and being treated with labetalol HCl, a specific method, such as a high 
performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction (e.g. LABETALOL: precautions: J Chromatogr 385:241,1987) should be employed in determining levels of catecholamines. Labetalol HCl 
has also been reported to produce a false-positive test for amphetamine when screening urine for the presence of drugs using the commercially available assay methods Toxi-Lab A ® (thin-layer 
chromatographic assay) and Emit-d.a.u ® (radioenzymatic assay). When patients being treated with labetalol have a positive urine test for amphetamine using these techniques, confirmation should be 
made by using more specific methods, such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique. Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Long-term oral dosing studies with labetalol HCl 
for 18 months in mice and for 2 years in rats showed no evidence of carcinogenesis.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: warnings: WARNINGS Hepatic Injury: Severe hepatocellular injury, confirmed by rechallenge in at least one case, occurs rarely with labetalol therapy.The hepatic injury is usually 
reversible, but hepatic necrosis and death have been reported. Injury has occurred after both short- and long-term treatment and may be slowly progressive despite minimal symptomatology. Similar 
hepatic events have been reported with a related research compound, dilevalol HCl, including two deaths. Dilevalol HCl is one of the four isomers of labetalol HCl. Thus, for patients taking labetalol,
periodic determination of suitable hepatic laboratory tests would be appropriate. Appropriate laboratory testing should be done at the first symptom/sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark 
urine, persistent anorexia, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained "flu-like" symptoms). LABETALOL: warnings: If the patient has laboratory evidence of liver injury or jaundice, 
labetalol should be stopped and not restarted. Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure. Beta-blockade carries a 
potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, 
labetalol HCl can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are well compensated. Congestive heart failure has been observed in patients receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol 
HCl does not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure : In patients with latent cardiac insufficiency, continued depression of the 
myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. LABETALOL: warnings: At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should 
be fully digitalized and/or be given a diuretic, and the response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and diuretic, therapy with labetalol 
hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn (gradually, if possible). Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal: Angina pectoris has not been reported upon labetalol HCl 
discontinuation. However, hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have 
occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered labetalol hydrochloride tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage 
should be gradually reduced over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored.

The FDA label for LABETALOL does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. While the label lists various gastrointestinal effects such as 
nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain, there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal ulcers or related hospitalization. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine
whether LABETALOL has an effect on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
