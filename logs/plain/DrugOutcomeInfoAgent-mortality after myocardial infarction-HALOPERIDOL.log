CONTENT: HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Cardiovascular Effects Tachycardia, hypotension, and hypertension have been reported. QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias have 
also been reported, in addition to ECG pattern changes compatible with the polymorphous configuration of Torsades de pointes, and may occur more frequently with high doses and in predisposed patients 
(see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Cases of sudden and unexpected death have been reported in association with the administration of haloperidol. The nature of the evidence makes it impossible to 
determine definitively what role, if any, haloperidol played in the outcome of the reported cases. The possibility that haloperidol caused death cannot, of course, be excluded, but it is to be kept in
mind that sudden and unexpected death may occur in psychotic patients when they go untreated or when they are treated with other antipsychotic drugs. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: CNS Effects 
Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) EPS during the administration of haloperidol have been reported frequently, often during the first few days of treatment. EPS can be categorized generally as 
Parkinson-like symptoms, akathisia, or dystonia (including opisthotonos and oculogyric crisis). While all can occur at relatively low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity at 
higher doses. The symptoms may be controlled with dose reductions or administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate, USP or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride, USP. It should be noted 
that persistent EPS have been reported; the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases. Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in 
susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, 
swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at
higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs Generally, patients 
receiving short-term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after 
abrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under “Tardive Dyskinesia” except for duration.

CONTENT: HALOPERIDOL: warnings: WARNINGS Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are 
at an increased risk of death. Haloperidol is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see BOXED WARNING ). Cardiovascular Effects Cases of sudden death, 
QT-prolongation, and Torsades de pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher 
risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other 
QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance , drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome). HALOPERIDOL: warnings: Tardive 
Dyskinesia A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome 
appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely
to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it
will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can 
develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. HALOPERIDOL: warnings: There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although 
the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the 
syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, 
antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who
suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or 
appropriate.

CONTENT: HALOPERIDOL: safe_handling_warning: OVERDOSAGE Manifestations In general, the symptoms of overdosage would be an exaggeration of known pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions, the most 
prominent of which would be: 1) severe extrapyramidal reactions, 2) hypotension, or 3) sedation. The patient would appear comatose with respiratory depression and hypotension which could be severe 
enough to produce a shock-like state. The extrapyramidal reaction would be manifest by muscular weakness or rigidity and a generalized or localized tremor as demonstrated by the akinetic or agitans 
types respectively. With accidental overdosage, hypertension rather than hypotension occurred in a 2 year old child. The risk of ECG changes associated with Torsades de pointes should be considered. 
(For further information regarding Torsades de pointes, please refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS . HALOPERIDOL: safe_handling_warning: ) Treatment Gastric lavage or induction of emesis should be carried out 
immediately followed by administration of activated charcoal. Since there is no specific antidote, treatment is primarily supportive. A patent airway must be established by use of an oropharyngeal 
airway or endotracheal tube or, in prolonged cases of coma, by tracheostomy. Respiratory depression may be counteracted by artificial respiration and mechanical respirators. Hypotension and 
circulatory collapse may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated albumin, and vasopressor agents such as metaraminol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine should
not be used. In case of severe extrapyramidal reactions, antiparkinson medication should be administered. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for signs of Q-T prolongation or 
dysrhythmias and monitoring should continue until the ECG is normal. HALOPERIDOL: safe_handling_warning: Severe arrhythmias should be treated with appropriate antiarrhythmic measures.

CONTENT: HALOPERIDOL: boxed_warning: WARNING Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs 
are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in 
drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was 
about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death)
or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. HALOPERIDOL: boxed_warning: Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may 
increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is
not clear. Haloperidol is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see WARNINGS ).

ANSWER: Haloperidol has been associated with cardiovascular effects such as QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias, which can be more frequent with high doses and in predisposed patients. 
Cases of sudden and unexpected death have been reported in association with the administration of haloperidol, but the evidence does not definitively determine the role of haloperidol in these cases. 
Additionally, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs, including haloperidol, are at an increased risk of death. However, it is not clear whether the 
increased mortality observed in studies is due to the drug itself or to characteristics of the patients.

The FDAHandler provided information indicating that HALOPERIDOL has been associated with cardiovascular effects such as QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias, which can be more frequent with 
high doses and in predisposed patients. Cases of sudden and unexpected death have been reported in association with the administration of haloperidol, but the evidence does not definitively determine 
the role of haloperidol in these cases. Additionally, elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs, including haloperidol, are at an increased risk of death. 
However, it is not clear whether the increased mortality observed in studies is due to the drug itself or to characteristics of the patients.

The information provided does not specifically address the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, but it does indicate potential cardiovascular risks associated with HALOPERIDOL. Therefore, we
cannot definitively say whether HALOPERIDOL increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction based on the FDA label data.
