CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status 
Epilepticus  Suicidal Behavior and Ideation  Serious Dermatologic Reactions  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity  Hypersensitivity  Cardiac 
Effects  Angioedema  Hepatic Injury  Hematopoietic Complications  Effects on Vitamin D and Bone  Exacerbation of Porphyria  Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn  Hyperglycemia [ see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported 
voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
adverse_reactions: Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema  . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There 
have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis,
liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been 
reported in association with administration of phenytoin. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and 
pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including 
benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s disease have been reported  . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease 
serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may 
also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [ see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions 
and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor 
twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those 
induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin 
levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. 
Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other 
types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis  . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria.

Have or had an enzyme problem called porphyria Have or had high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) Drink alcohol Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may harm your 
unborn baby. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: spl_medguide: If you become pregnant while 
taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of extended phenytoin
sodium capsules. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby
medicine to prevent this. All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If you are of 
childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Pregnancy Registry: If you become 
pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
spl_medguide: You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Are 
breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Phenytoin can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take extended phenytoin sodium capsules while you are 
breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. These medicines can change the 
levels of phenytoin in your blood. Taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules with certain other medicines can cause side effects or affect how well they work. Do not start or stop other medicines 
without talking to your healthcare provider. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin sodium or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of 
untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. 
Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being 
treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or 
worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be
reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin sodium can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions 
(SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis
(AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  . The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued at the first 
sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be 
considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a 
strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests 
that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, 
retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 
variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in 
patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers  . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance 
and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, 
comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms 
(DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, 
including phenytoin sodium. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in 
association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is 
often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as 
fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin sodium-treated patients, both at recommended 
phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity  . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been
reported in patients treated with phenytoin sodium in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper 
airway swelling occur. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, 
including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin sodium. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or 
may occur in isolation . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin 
hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic
Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, 
granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: There have been a number of reports suggesting a 
relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s disease. Although a cause 
and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node 
involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS  . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to 
achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral
density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the 
metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related 
laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound
phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 
5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this 
disease. 5. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to
phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), 
and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive 
deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases 
of malignancies, including neuroblastoma.

        Question: Does EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increase or decrease the risk of aplastic anemia?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.
2. FDAHandler responded by indicating that EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM has been associated with hematopoietic complications, some of which have been fatal, including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, 
granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. However, the frequency of these events is not reliably 
estimated, and a causal relationship to drug exposure is not always clear.
        -----
        Final answer: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM has been associated with hematopoietic complications, including conditions that affect the bone marrow and blood cells. These complications can be 
severe and sometimes fatal. While pure red cell aplasia has been reported, which is a condition related to aplastic anemia, the frequency of these events and the clarity of the causal relationship to 
the drug are not well established. Therefore, it is known that there is an association, but the degree of risk and the reliability of the causal relationship are not clearly defined.

The question was whether EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. According to the information provided by FDAHandler, EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM has been 
associated with various hematopoietic complications, some of which have been fatal. These complications include a range of conditions that affect the bone marrow and blood cells, such as 
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia, with or without bone marrow suppression. Additionally, pure red cell aplasia, which is related to aplastic anemia, 
has been reported. However, the frequency of these events and the clarity of the causal relationship to the drug are not well established.

Therefore, while there is an association between EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM and hematopoietic complications, including conditions related to aplastic anemia, the degree of risk and the reliability of 
the causal relationship are not clearly defined.
