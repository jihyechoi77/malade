        Question: Which three drugs from the provided list are the most common representatives in the category angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. From the provided list, identify the drugs that are angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors).
2. Use the prescription rates from the medical database query to determine the most commonly prescribed ACE inhibitors.
3. Select the top three drugs based on their prescription rates, ensuring they are not derivatives or combinations with other drugs, and that they have different active ingredients.
4. The drugs with the highest prescription rates are Lisinopril, Captopril, and Enalapril Maleate, with 91457, 12167, and 3935 prescriptions respectively.
5. Choose the names from the original list that exactly match the generic names provided in the query results.
        -----
        Final answer: LISINOPRIL, CAPTOPRIL, ENALAPRIL MALEATE
