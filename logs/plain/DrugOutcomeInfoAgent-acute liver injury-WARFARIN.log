CONTENT: WARFARIN: drug_interactions: 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, antibiotics, antifungals, botanical (herbal) products, and inhibitors and inducers of 
CYP2C9, 1A2, or 3A4. ( 7 ) Consult labeling of all concurrently used drugs for complete information about interactions with warfarin sodium or increased risks for bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 General 
Information Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired
hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic 
mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: It is important to note that some
drugs may interact by more than one mechanism. More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, 
including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [ see Boxed Warning ]. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information 
about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding. 7.2 CYP450 Interactions CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 
1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 
3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin. Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease
INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin. Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2 ; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. 
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, 
stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer. Table 2: Examples of

nafcillin, phenytoin, pioglitazone, prednisone, rifampin, rufinamide 7.3 Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk Examples of drugs known to increase the risk of bleeding are presented in Table 3 . WARFARIN:
drug_interactions: Because bleeding risk is increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin, closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin. WARFARIN: 
drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs that Can Increase the Risk of Bleeding Drug Class Specific Drugs Anticoagulants argatroban, dabigatran, bivalirudin, desirudin, heparin, lepirudin Antiplatelet Agents

paroxetine, sertraline, venlaf WARFARIN: drug_interactions: axine, vilazodone 7.4 Antibiotics and Antifungals There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or 
antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin. Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic 
or antifungal in patients taking warfarin. 7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals. Few adequate, 
well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with 
botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. Some botanicals 
may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of 
thromboembolism, and for whom the benefits of warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks  . Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a 
pattern of congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Because these data were not collected in adequate and well-controlled studies, this incidence of major birth defects is not an 
adequate basis for comparison to the estimated incidences in the control group or the U.S. general population and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. Consider the benefits and risks 
of warfarin sodium and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing warfarin sodium to a pregnant woman. WARFARIN: pregnancy: Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother
or the use of medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk 
of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions In humans, warfarin 
crosses the placenta, and concentrations in fetal plasma approach the maternal values. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in 
about 5% of exposed offspring. Warfarin embryopathy is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata) and growth retardation (including low birth 
weight). WARFARIN: pregnancy: Central nervous system and eye abnormalities have also been reported, including dorsal midline dysplasia characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker 
malformation, midline cerebellar atrophy, and ventral midline dysplasia characterized by optic atrophy. Mental retardation, blindness, schizencephaly, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and other adverse 
pregnancy outcomes have been reported following warfarin exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy  .

CONTENT: WARFARIN: spl_medguide: MEDICATION GUIDE Dispense with Medication Guide available at: www.tevausa.com/medguides Warfarin (war' far in) Sodium (soe' dee um) Tablets What is the most important 
information I should know about warfarin sodium tablets? Warfarin sodium tablets can cause bleeding which can be serious and sometimes lead to death. This is because warfarin sodium tablets are a 
blood thinner medicine that lowers the chance of blood clots forming in your body. WARFARIN: spl_medguide: You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take warfarin sodium tablets and: are 65 years 
of age or older have a history of stomach or intestinal bleeding have high blood pressure (hypertension) have a history of stroke, or “mini-stroke” (transient ischemic attack or TIA) have serious 
heart disease have a low blood count or cancer have had trauma, such as an accident or surgery have kidney problems take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including: a medicine that
contains heparin other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) take warfarin sodium for a long time. Warfarin sodium is the active ingredient in 
warfarin sodium tablets. Tell your healthcare provider if you take any of these medicines. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above. WARFARIN: 
spl_medguide: Many other medicines can interact with warfarin sodium tablets and affect the dose you need or increase warfarin sodium tablets side effects. Do not change or stop any of your medicines 
or start any new medicines before you talk to your healthcare provider. Do not take other medicines that contain warfarin sodium while taking warfarin sodium tablets. Get your regular blood test to 
check for your response to warfarin sodium tablets. This blood test is called an INR test. The INR test checks to see how fast your blood clots. Your healthcare provider will decide what INR numbers 
are best for you. Your dose of warfarin sodium tablets will be adjusted to keep your INR in a target range for you. WARFARIN: spl_medguide: Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of 
the following signs or symptoms of bleeding problems: pain, swelling, or discomfort headaches, dizziness, or weakness unusual bruising (bruises that develop without known cause or grow in size) 
nosebleeds bleeding gums bleeding from cuts takes a long time to stop menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal pink or brown urine red or black stools coughing up blood 
vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds Some foods and beverages can interact with warfarin sodium tablets and affect your treatment and dose. Eat a normal, balanced diet. Talk to 
your healthcare provider before you make any diet changes. Do not eat large amounts of leafy, green vegetables. Leafy, green vegetables contain vitamin K. Certain vegetable oils also contain large 
amounts of vitamin K. Too much vitamin K can lower the effect of warfarin sodium tablets. Always tell all of your healthcare providers that you take warfarin sodium tablets.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue necrosis: Necrosis or gangrene of skin or other tissues can occur, with severe cases requiring debridement or amputation. 
Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulants if necessary. ( 5.2 ) Calciphylaxis: Fatal and serious cases have occurred. Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative 
anticoagulation therapy. ( 5.3 ) Acute kidney injury may occur during episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. ( 5.4 ) Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli: Some cases have 
progressed to necrosis or death. Discontinue warfarin sodium if such emboli occur. ( 5.5 ) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Initial therapy with warfarin sodium in HIT has resulted in cases of 
amputation and death. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Warfarin sodium may be considered after platelet count has normalized. ( 5.6 ) Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves: Warfarin sodium may 
cause fetal harm; however, the benefits may outweigh the risks. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk 
factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, 
cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors  , certain concomitant drugs  , and long duration of warfarin therapy. Perform regular monitoring of INR 
in all treated patients. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration 
of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding. Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR 
levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs  . Instruct 
patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding  . 5.2 Tissue Necrosis Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other
tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (<0.1%). WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin
sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported. Careful clinical evaluation is required to 
determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin 
sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.3 Calciphylaxis Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium 
uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat 
calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. 5. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Acute Kidney Injury In patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of
kidney disease, acute kidney injury may occur with warfarin sodium, possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria  . More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is 
advised in patients with compromised renal function. 5.5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque 
emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the 
kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as “purple toes syndrome. 
WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.6 Limb Ischemia, 
Necrosis, and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS Do not use warfarin sodium as initial therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia 
with thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). Cases of limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started 
or continued. In some patients, sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and/or death. Treatment with warfarin sodium may be considered after the platelet count has normalized. 5.7 Use 
in Pregnant Women with Mechanical Heart Valves Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: While warfarin sodium is contraindicated 
during pregnancy, the potential benefits of using warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual 
situations, the decision to initiate or continue warfarin sodium should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient’s 
medical situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and 
fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this 
drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus  . 5.

        Final answer: The WARFARIN label does not specifically mention an increased risk of acute liver injury, but it does list hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes as possible adverse reactions. 
This indicates that liver issues can occur with the use of WARFARIN, although the exact frequency or risk level is not detailed in the label. Therefore, while there is a potential for liver-related 
side effects, the degree of risk for acute liver injury specifically is not clearly defined based on the label information.
