CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: warnings: ) Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality : ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have 
been reported in the world literature. When pregnancy is detected, ACE inhibitors should be discontinued as soon as possible. The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death. Oligohydramnios has also 
been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal function; oligohydramnios in this setting has been associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic 
lung development. Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to the ACE-inhibitor 
exposure. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose embryos and 
fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant, physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of 
captopril as soon as possible. Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised
of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, captopril should be 
discontinued unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a non-stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending upon the week 
of pregnancy. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Infants with histories
of in utero exposure to ACE inhibitors should be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and 
renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. While captopril may be removed from the adult 
circulation by hemodialysis, there is inadequate data concerning the effectiveness of hemodialysis for removing it from the circulation of neonates or children. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective 
for removing captopril; there is no information concerning exchange transfusion for removing captopril from the general circulation. When captopril was given to rabbits at doses about 0. CAPTOPRIL: 
warnings: 8 to 70 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, low incidences of craniofacial malformations were seen. No teratogenic effects of captopril were seen in studies of 
pregnant rats and hamsters. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 150 times (in hamsters) and 625 times (in rats) the maximum recommended human dose. Hepatic Failure : Rarely, ACE Inhibitors 
have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. 
Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. Hydrochlorothiazide : 
Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in 
patients with impaired renal function. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte 
balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic 
lupus erythematosus has been reported. In general, lithium should not be given with diuretics (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Hydrochlorothiazide ).

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: warnings: WARNINGS Captopril : Anaphylactoid and Possible Related Reactions : Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and 
polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including captopril) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema 
: Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been seen in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including captopril. If angioedema involves the 
tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Emergency therapy, including but not necessarily limited to, subcutaneous administration of a 1:1000 solution of epinephrine 
should be promptly instituted. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Swelling confined to the face, mucous membranes of the mouth, lips and extremities has usually resolved with discontinuation of treatment; some 
cases required medical therapy. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Captopril .) Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with 
ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. 
The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in
the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization : Two patients undergoing desensitizing 
treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were 
temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure : Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with 
high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate 
absorption. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis : Neutropenia (< 1000/mm 3 ) with myeloid hypoplasia has resulted from use of captopril.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: information_for_patients: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling 
of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal 
Angioedema .) Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which may be a sign of neutropenia, or of progressive edema which might be related to 
proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. 
Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult with the physician. CAPTOPRIL: information_for_patients: 
Patients should be advised not to use potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes without consulting their physician. (See PRECAUTIONS: General and Drug
Interactions: Captopril ; ADVERSE REACTIONS: Captopril .) Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of medication unless instructed by the physician. Heart failure patients on 
captopril therapy should be cautioned against rapid increases in physical activity. Patients should be informed that captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken one hour before meals 
(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: pregnancy: Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors, and they should also be 
told that these consequences do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. These patients should be asked to report pregnancies 
to their physicians as soon as possible.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Captopril : Reported incidences are based on clinical trials involving approximately 7000 patients. Renal : About one of 100 patients developed
proteinuria (see WARNINGS ). Each of the following has been reported in approximately 1 to 2 of 1000 patients and are of uncertain relationship to drug use: renal insufficiency, renal failure, 
nephrotic syndrome, polyuria, oliguria, and urinary frequency. Hematologic : Neutropenia/agranulocytosis has occurred (see WARNINGS ). Cases of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been 
reported. Dermatologic : Rash, often with pruritus, and sometimes with fever, arthralgia, and eosinophilia, occurred in about 4 to 7 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients, usually 
during the first four weeks of therapy. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: It is usually maculopapular, and rarely urticarial. The rash is usually mild and disappears within a few days of dosage reduction,
short-term treatment with an antihistaminic agent, and/or discontinuing therapy; remission may occur even if captopril is continued. Pruritus, without rash, occurs in about 2 of 100 patients. Between 
7 and 10 percent of patients with skin rash have shown eosinophilia and/or positive ANA titers. A reversible associated pemphigoid-like lesion, and photosensitivity, have also been reported. Flushing 
or pallor has been reported in 2 to 5 of 1000 patients. Cardiovascular : Hypotension may occur; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (Drug Interactions) for discussion of hypotension with captopril therapy. 
Tachycardia, chest pain, and palpitations have each been observed in approximately 1 of 100 patients. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, Raynaud’s syndrome, and 
congestive heart failure have each occurred in 2 to 3 of 1000 patients. Dysgeusia : Approximately 2 to 4 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients developed a diminution or loss of taste 
perception. Taste impairment is reversible and usually self-limited (2 to 3 months) even with continued drug administration. Weight loss may be associated with the loss of taste. Angioedema : 
Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in approximately one in 1000 patients. Angioedema involving the upper airways has caused
fatal airway obstruction. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Cough : Cough has been
reported in 0.5 to 2% of patients treated with captopril in clinical trials (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Captopril: Cough ). The following have been reported in about 0.5 to 2 percent of patients but 
did not appear at increased frequency compared to placebo or other treatments used in controlled trials: gastric irritation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, 
aphthous ulcers, peptic ulcer, dizziness, headache, malaise, fatigue, insomnia, dry mouth, dyspnea, alopecia, paresthesias. Other clinical adverse effects reported since the drug was marketed are 
listed below by body system. In this setting, an incidence or causal relationship cannot be accurately determined. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Body as a Whole : Anaphylactoid reactions (see 
WARNINGS: Captopril: Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). General : asthenia, gynecomastia. Cardiovascular : cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular 
accident/insufficiency, rhythm disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, syncope. Dermatologic : bullous pemphigus, erythema multiforme (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), exfoliative dermatitis. 
Gastrointestinal : pancreatitis, glossitis, dyspepsia. Hematologic : anemia, including aplastic and hemolytic. Hepatobiliary : jaundice, hepatitis, including rare cases of necrosis, cholestasis. 
Metabolic : symptomatic hyponatremia. Musculoskeletal : myalgia, myasthenia. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Nervous/Psychiatric : ataxia, confusion, depression, nervousness, somnolence. Respiratory : 
bronchospasm, eosinophilic pneumonitis, rhinitis. Special Senses : blurred vision. Urogenital : impotence. As with other ACE inhibitors, a syndrome has been reported which may include: fever, myalgia,
arthralgia, interstitial nephritis, vasculitis, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, eosinophilia and an elevated ESR. Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality: See WARNINGS: Captopril: 
Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality . Hydrochlorothiazide : Gastrointestinal System : anorexia, gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea, constipation, jaundice (intrahepatic 
cholestatic jaundice), pancreatitis, and sialadenitis. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Central Nervous System : dizziness, vertigo, paresthesias, headache, and xanthopsia. Hematologic : leukopenia, 
agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and hemolytic anemia. Cardiovascular : orthostatic hypotension. Hypersensitivity : purpura, photosensitivity, rash, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis 
(vasculitis; cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis, and anaphylactic reactions. Other : hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia, muscle spasm, weakness, 
restlessness, and transient blurred vision. Whenever adverse reactions are moderate or severe, thiazide dosage should be reduced or therapy withdrawn. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Altered Laboratory 
Findings: Serum Electrolytes : Hyperkalemia: small increases in serum potassium, especially in patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS: Captopril ). Hyponatremia : particularly in patients 
receiving a low sodium diet or concomitant diuretics. BUN/Serum Creatinine : Transient elevations of BUN or serum creatinine especially in volume or salt depleted patients or those with renovascular 
hypertension may occur. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum 
creatinine. Hematologic : A positive ANA has been reported. Liver Function Tests : Elevations of liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have occurred. CAPTOPRIL: 
adverse_reactions: Postmarketing Experience : Non-melanoma Skin Cancer : Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel 
System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1
additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of ≥ 50,000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per 
year. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharma Holdings, Inc. at 1-844- 874-7464 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

CAPTOPRIL, as an ACE inhibitor, can rarely increase the risk of a syndrome that may lead to acute liver injury, starting with cholestatic jaundice and potentially progressing to fulminant hepatic 
necrosis and sometimes death. This information is based on the CAPTOPRIL label provided by the FDA, which states that this association is rare and the mechanism of the syndrome is not understood. 
Patients who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes while on CAPTOPRIL should discontinue the medication and receive appropriate medical follow-up.
