CONTENT: MINOCYCLINE: use_in_specific_populations: 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Minocycline like other tetracycline-class drugs can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( 5.1 , 
8.1 ) • The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth. ( 5.1 , 8.4 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D [ see 
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 )] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be 
apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. MINOCYCLINE: 
use_in_specific_populations: Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Rare spontaneous reports of 
congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is available regarding these reports; 
therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30
mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline 
hydrochloride extended-release tablets). MINOCYCLINE: use_in_specific_populations: Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a 
dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). 
Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri-and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation 
(postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 
times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). MINOCYCLINE: use_in_specific_populations: No effects of 
treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received 
minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning ability, or 
reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals). 8.3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline-class antibiotics are excreted in human milk. Because of the
potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from the tetracycline-class antibiotics, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue 
the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother . 8.

CONTENT: MINOCYCLINE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a carcinogenicity study in which 
minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female rats once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 200 mg/kg/day, minocycline HCl was associated in both genders with follicular cell 
tumors of the thyroid gland, including increased incidences of adenomas, carcinomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in males, and adenomas and the combined incidence of adenomas 
and carcinomas in females. In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure 
to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. MINOCYCLINE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Mutagenesis 
Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not 
clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral 
doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline 
hydrochloride extended-release tablets). MINOCYCLINE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats 
(resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely 
affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 
100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. 
Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender 
who are attempting to conceive a child.

increased risk of aplastic anemia. While the label does list various hematological issues such as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and eosinophilia as adverse reactions reported in clinical trials 
and postmarketing experience, aplastic anemia is not included among them.

Therefore, based on the information provided by the FDA label, it cannot be concluded that MINOCYCLINE increases the risk of aplastic anemia. The absence of this condition in the label suggests that 
either it has not been reported with sufficient frequency or evidence to warrant inclusion, or it has not been observed at all in association with MINOCYCLINE use.

Final Answer: Does MINOCYCLINE increase or decrease the risk of aplastic anemia?

Based on the FDA label data, there is no information to suggest that MINOCYCLINE increases the risk of aplastic anemia.
