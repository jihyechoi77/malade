CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of adverse developmental effects (long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function) in animals 
following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines. Nursing Mothers: Risk Summary Clonazepam is excreted in human milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed 
to benzodiazepines through breast milk. There are no data on the effects of clonazepam on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the 
mother's clinical need for clonazepam tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from clonazepam tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations 
Infants exposed to clonazepam through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Pediatric Use: Because of the possibility that adverse 
effects on physical or mental development could become apparent only after many years, a benefit-risk consideration of the long-term use of clonazepam tablets is important in pediatric patients being 
treated for seizure disorder (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients with panic disorder below the age of 18 have not been 
established. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of clonazepam tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually 
starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. CLONAZEPAM: 
precautions: Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. Metabolites of clonazepam tablets are excreted by the kidneys; to 
avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased 
hepatic and/or renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to assess hepatic and/or renal function at the time of dose selection. Sedating drugs may cause confusion 
and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of clonazepam tablets and observed closely.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Like other antiepileptic medicines, clonazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call your healthcare 
provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse 
anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting on dangerous impulses new or worse irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) acting 
aggressive, being angry, or violent other unusual changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden 
changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are 
worried about symptoms. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may 
check for other causes. Do not stop clonazepam tablets without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping clonazepam tablets 
suddenly can cause seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). What are clonazepam tablets? Clonazepam tablets are a prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat: certain 
types of seizure disorders (epilepsy) in adults and children panic disorder with or without fear of open spaces (agoraphobia) in adults Clonazepam tablets are a federally controlled substance (C-IV) 
because it contains clonazepam that can be abused or lead to dependence. Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Selling or giving away 
clonazepam tablets may harm others, and is against the law. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs. It is not known
if clonazepam tablets are safe or effective in treating panic disorder in children younger than 18 years old. Who should not take clonazepam tablets? Do not take clonazepam tablets if you: are 
allergic to benzodiazepines have significant liver disease have an eye disease called acute narrow angle glaucoma Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you have any of the problems 
listed above. Before you take clonazepam tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you: have liver or kidney problems have lung problems (respiratory disease) have or have had depression, mood 
problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior have any other medical problems are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Taking clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy may cause your
baby to have symptoms of sedation (breathing problems, sluggishness, low muscle tone), and/or withdrawal symptoms (jitteriness, irritability, restlessness, shaking, excessive crying, feeding 
problems). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you are pregnant during treatment with clonazepam tablets. If you become pregnant while taking clonazepam tablets, 
talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can register by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect
information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Clonazepam can pass into breast milk. Breastfeeding during treatment with clonazepam 
tablets may cause your baby to have sleepiness, feeding problems, and decreased weight gain. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby while you 
take clonazepam tablets. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Taking clonazepam 
tablets with certain other medicines can cause side effects or affect how well clonazepam tablets or the other medicines work. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking to your healthcare 
provider. How should I take clonazepam tablets? Take clonazepam tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. If you take clonazepam tablets for seizures, your healthcare provider may change 
the dose until you are taking the right amount of medicine to control your symptoms. Clonazepam is available as a tablet. Do not stop taking clonazepam tablets without first talking to your healthcare
provider. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Clonazepam tablets should be taken with water and swallowed whole.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). The use of benzodiazepines, 
including clonazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. CLONAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing clonazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue clonazepam tablets
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: While these findings are noteworthy, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) data collected in these trials revealed a larger decline in HAM-D scores in the 
clonazepam group than the placebo group suggesting that clonazepam-treated patients were not experiencing a worsening or emergence of clinical depression. Other Adverse Events Observed During the 
Premarketing Evaluation of Clonazepam Tablets in Panic Disorder: Following is a list of modified CIGY terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events reported by patients treated with clonazepam 
tablets at multiple doses during clinical trials. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, 
those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative, and events reported only once and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening. CLONAZEPAM:

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics: The precise mechanism by which clonazepam exerts its antiseizure and antipanic effects is unknown, although it is 
believed to be related to its ability to enhance the activity of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. Pharmacokinetics: Clonazepam is 
rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. The absolute bioavailability of clonazepam is about 90%. Maximum plasma concentrations of clonazepam are reached within 1 to 4 hours after 
oral administration. Clonazepam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins. Clonazepam is highly metabolized, with less than 2% unchanged clonazepam being excreted in the urine. Biotransformation 
occurs mainly by reduction of the 7-nitro group to the 4-amino derivative. CLONAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: This derivative can be acetylated, hydroxylated and glucuronidated. Cytochrome P-450 
including CYP3A, may play an important role in clonazepam reduction and oxidation. The elimination half-life of clonazepam is typically 30 to 40 hours. Clonazepam pharmacokinetics are dose-independent
throughout the dosing range. There is no evidence that clonazepam induces its own metabolism or that of other drugs in humans. Pharmacokinetics in Demographic Subpopulations and in Disease States: 
Controlled studies examining the influence of gender and age on clonazepam pharmacokinetics have not been conducted, nor have the effects of renal or liver disease on clonazepam pharmacokinetics been 
studied. Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair clonazepam elimination. CLONAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: Thus, caution should be exercised 
when administering clonazepam to these patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). In children, clearance values of 0.42 ± 0.32 mL/min/kg (ages 2 to 18 years) and 0.88 ± 0.4 mL/min/kg (ages 7 to 12 years) were
reported; these values decreased with increasing body weight. Ketogenic diet in children does not affect clonazepam concentrations. Clinical Trials: Panic Disorder: The effectiveness of clonazepam 
tablets in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (DSM-IIIR) with or 
without agoraphobia. CLONAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: In these studies, clonazepam tablets were shown to be significantly more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder on change from 
baseline in panic attack frequency, the Clinician’s Global Impression Severity of Illness Score and the Clinician’s Global Impression Improvement Score. Study 1 was a 9-week, fixed-dose study 
involving clonazepam tablets doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in four phases: a 1-week placebo lead-in, a 3-week upward titration, a 6-week fixed dose, and a 
7-week discontinuance phase. A significant difference from placebo was observed consistently only for the 1 mg/day group. The difference between the 1 mg dose group and placebo in reduction from 
baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 1 panic attack per week.

ANSWER: Clonazepam is contraindicated in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of significant liver disease, which implies that it may increase the risk of liver injury or be harmful in the 
presence of liver disease. The label specifically states that because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, liver disease could impair clonazepam elimination. Therefore, caution is advised when 
administering clonazepam to patients with liver disease, and it may be useful to assess hepatic function at the time of dose selection.

The final answer to the question "Does CLONAZEPAM increase or decrease the risk of acute liver injury?" is that CLONAZEPAM may increase the risk of liver injury, especially in patients with 
pre-existing liver disease. It is contraindicated in patients with significant liver disease, and caution is advised when administering it to patients with liver disease due to potential impairment of
drug elimination. This conclusion is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which indicates that CLONAZEPAM is contraindicated in patients with clinical or biochemical evidence of 
significant liver disease and that liver disease could impair clonazepam elimination.
