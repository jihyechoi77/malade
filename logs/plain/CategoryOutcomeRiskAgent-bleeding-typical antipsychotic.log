                Passages:
                1. Drug HALOPERIDOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether haloperidol increases or decreases the risk of bleeding. I asked FDAHandler for information regarding the effects of haloperidol on bleeding risk. FDAHandler responded with 
DO-NOT-KNOW, which means that the FDA label for haloperidol does not specify any information about its impact on bleeding risk. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to 
determine whether haloperidol has an effect on bleeding risk. The absence of information in the FDA label suggests that there may not be a known or established effect, or that it has not been 
sufficiently studied or reported to warrant inclusion in the label.
2. Drug THIOTHIXENE: The FDA label for THIOTHIXENE does not specifically mention an increased or decreased risk of bleeding. However, it does note hematologic effects such as leukopenia and 
leukocytosis, and mentions that other antipsychotic drugs have been associated with conditions like agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia, which could 
theoretically affect bleeding risk. Nonetheless, a direct causal relationship between THIOTHIXENE and bleeding risk is not established in the label.
3. Drug PIMOZIDE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for PIMOZIDE does not specify any information regarding the drug's effect on bleeding risk. Therefore, I cannot determine whether PIMOZIDE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.

                Does the typical antipsychotic category of drugs increase the risk of
                bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the typical antipsychotic category of drugs increase the risk of bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for HALOPERIDOL does not specify any information about its impact on bleeding risk.
2. The FDA label for THIOTHIXENE does not specifically mention an increased or decreased risk of bleeding but notes hematologic effects that could theoretically affect bleeding risk.
3. The FDA label for PIMOZIDE does not specify any information regarding the drug's effect on bleeding risk.
4. Given the lack of specific information on bleeding risk for HALOPERIDOL and PIMOZIDE, and the indirect mention of hematologic effects for THIOTHIXENE without establishing a direct causal 
relationship, it is not possible to determine a clear effect of typical antipsychotic drugs on bleeding risk.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the typical antipsychotic category of drugs on the risk of bleeding.
