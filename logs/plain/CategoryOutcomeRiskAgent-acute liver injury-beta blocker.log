                Passages:
                1. Drug METOPROLOL TARTRATE: METOPROLOL TARTRATE does not have a known increased risk of acute liver injury according to the label information. However, there have been very rare 
postmarketing reports of liver-related issues such as hepatitis, jaundice, and non-specific hepatic dysfunction. The rarity of these reports suggests that if there is a risk, it is likely very low.
2. Drug LABETALOL: LABETALOL has been associated with an increased risk of acute liver injury, although such occurrences are rare. It is recommended that patients taking LABETALOL undergo periodic 
liver function tests, and the drug should be discontinued if evidence of liver injury appears.
3. Drug ATENOLOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ATENOLOL does not indicate that it increases the risk of acute liver injury. However, during postmarketing experience, there have been reports of elevated liver enzymes and/or 
bilirubin, which could suggest liver involvement, but this is not specified as acute liver injury. Therefore, we cannot definitively say whether ATENOLOL increases or decreases the risk of acute liver
injury based on the available FDA label information.

                Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of
                acute liver injury, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passage for METOPROLOL TARTRATE indicates that there is no known increased risk of acute liver injury according to the label, but very rare postmarketing reports suggest a very low 
potential risk.
2. The passage for LABETALOL states that there is an increased risk of acute liver injury, although such occurrences are rare.
3. The passage for ATENOLOL does not provide a definitive answer, as the FDA label does not indicate an increased risk, but there have been reports of elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin, which 
could suggest liver involvement.
4. Based on the information provided, there is no consistent pattern across all beta blockers that would suggest a clear effect on the risk of acute liver injury.
5. The evidence for METOPROLOL TARTRATE and ATENOLOL is weak, based on very rare postmarketing reports and unspecified reports of liver involvement, respectively.
6. The evidence for LABETALOL is slightly stronger, as it recommends periodic liver function tests and discontinuation if liver injury appears, indicating a recognized but rare risk.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the beta blocker category of drugs on the risk of acute liver injury, as the evidence is inconsistent and generally weak across different drugs within
the category.
