CONTENT: LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse effects are mild and transient and occur early in the course of treatment. In controlled clinical trials of 3 to 4 months' 
duration, discontinuation of labetalol hydrochloride tablets due to one or more adverse effects was required in 7% of all patients. In these same trials, other agents with solely beta-blocking 
activity used in the control groups led to discontinuation in 8% to 10% of patients, and a centrally acting alpha-agonist led to discontinuation in 30% of patients. The incidence rates of adverse 
reactions listed in the following table were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials comparing labetalol HCl, placebo, metoprolol, and propranolol over treatment periods of 3 and 4 
months. Where the frequency of adverse effects for labetalol HCl and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain. The rates are based on adverse reactions considered probably drug related by 
the investigator. LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: If all reports are considered, the rates are somewhat higher (e.g., dizziness, 20%; nausea, 14%; fatigue, 11%), but the overall conclusions are 
unchanged. LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: Labetalol HCI Placebo Propranolol Metoprolol (n = 227) (n = 98) (n = 84) (n = 49) % % % % Body as a whole Fatigue 5 0 12 12 Asthenia 1 1 1 0 Headache 2 1 1 2

CONTENT: LABETALOL: warnings: WARNINGS Hepatic Injury: Severe hepatocellular injury, confirmed by rechallenge in at least one case, occurs rarely with labetalol therapy.The hepatic injury is usually 
reversible, but hepatic necrosis and death have been reported. Injury has occurred after both short- and long-term treatment and may be slowly progressive despite minimal symptomatology. Similar 
hepatic events have been reported with a related research compound, dilevalol HCl, including two deaths. Dilevalol HCl is one of the four isomers of labetalol HCl. Thus, for patients taking labetalol,
periodic determination of suitable hepatic laboratory tests would be appropriate. Appropriate laboratory testing should be done at the first symptom/sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark 
urine, persistent anorexia, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained "flu-like" symptoms). LABETALOL: warnings: If the patient has laboratory evidence of liver injury or jaundice, 
labetalol should be stopped and not restarted. Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure. Beta-blockade carries a 
potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, 
labetalol HCl can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are well compensated. Congestive heart failure has been observed in patients receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol 
HCl does not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure : In patients with latent cardiac insufficiency, continued depression of the 
myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. LABETALOL: warnings: At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should 
be fully digitalized and/or be given a diuretic, and the response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and diuretic, therapy with labetalol 
hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn (gradually, if possible). Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal: Angina pectoris has not been reported upon labetalol HCl 
discontinuation. However, hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have 
occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered labetalol hydrochloride tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage 
should be gradually reduced over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. LABETALOL: warnings: If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, 
therapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients 
should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to 
discontinue therapy with labetalol hydrochloride tablets abruptly in patients being treated for hypertension. Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema): Patients with 
bronchospastic disease should, in general, not receive beta-blockers. Labetalol hydrochloride tablets may be used with caution, however, in patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other 
antihypertensive agents.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: precautions: Also, transient scalp tingling may occur, usually when treatment with labetalol hydrochloride tabletsis initiated (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Laboratory Tests As with 
any new drug given over prolonged periods, laboratory parameters should be observed over regular intervals. In patients with concomitant illnesses, such as impaired renal function, appropriate tests 
should be done to monitor these conditions. Drug Interactions In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking labetalol HCl in combination with tricyclic antidepressants experienced tremor, as compared to 0.7%
reported to occur with labetalol HCl alone. The contribution of each of the treatments to this adverse reaction is unknown, but the possibility of a drug interaction cannot be excluded. LABETALOL: 
precautions: Drugs possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of beta-receptor agonist drugs in patients with bronchospasm; therefore, doses greater than the normal 
antiasthmatic dose of beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs may be required. Cimetidine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of labetalol HCl. Since this could be explained either by enhanced 
absorption or by an alteration of hepatic metabolism of labetalol HCl, special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients. Synergism has been 
shown between halothane anesthesia and intravenously administered labetalol HCl. LABETALOL: precautions: During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using labetalol HCl in association with halothane, 
high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an 
increase in central venous pressure. The anesthesiologist should be informed when a patient is receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol HCl blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without 
preventing its hypotensive effect. If labetalol HCl is used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional antihypertensive effects may occur. Care should be taken if labetalol is 
used concomitantly with calcium antagonists of the verapamil type. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. LABETALOL: precautions: 
comitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be 
more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. Drug & OR 
Laboratory Test Interactions The presence of labetalol metabolites in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary catecholamines, metanephrine, normetanephrine, and vanillylmandelic 
acid when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods. In screening patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma and being treated with labetalol HCl, a specific method, such as a high 
performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction (e.g. LABETALOL: precautions: J Chromatogr 385:241,1987) should be employed in determining levels of catecholamines. Labetalol HCl 
has also been reported to produce a false-positive test for amphetamine when screening urine for the presence of drugs using the commercially available assay methods Toxi-Lab A ® (thin-layer 
chromatographic assay) and Emit-d.a.u ® (radioenzymatic assay). When patients being treated with labetalol have a positive urine test for amphetamine using these techniques, confirmation should be 
made by using more specific methods, such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique. Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Long-term oral dosing studies with labetalol HCl 
for 18 months in mice and for 2 years in rats showed no evidence of carcinogenesis.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics: The capacity of labetalol HCl to block alpha receptors in man has been demonstrated by attenuation of the pressor effect of phenylephrine 
and by a significant reduction of the pressor response caused by immersing the hand in ice-cold water ("cold-pressor test"). Labetalol HCl's beta 1 -receptor blockade in man was demonstrated by a 
small decrease in the resting heart rate, attenuation of tachycardia produced by isoproterenol or exercise, and by attenuation of the reflex tachycardia to the hypotension produced by amyl nitrite. 
Beta 2 -receptor blockade was demonstrated by inhibition of the isoproterenol-induced fall in diastolic blood pressure. Both the alpha- and beta-blocking actions of orally administered labetalol HCl 
contribute to a decrease in blood pressure in hypertensive patients. LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: Labetalol HCl consistently, in dose-related fashion, blunted increases in exercise-induced blood 
pressure and heart rate, and in their double product. The pulmonary circulation during exercise was not affected by labetalol HCl dosing. Single oral doses of labetalol HCl administered to patients 
with coronary artery disease had no significant effect on sinus rate, intraventricular conduction, or QRS duration. The atrioventricular (A-V) conduction time was modestly prolonged in two of seven 
patients. In another study, IV labetalol HCl slightly prolonged A-V nodal conduction time and atrial effective refractory period with only small changes in heart rate. The effects on A-V nodal 
refractoriness were inconsistent. Labetalol HCl produces dose-related falls in blood pressure without reflex tachycardia and without significant reduction in heart rate, presumably through a mixture 
of its alpha- and beta-blocking effects. LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: Hemodynamic effects are variable, with small, nonsignificant changes in cardiac output seen in some studies but not others, 
and small decreases in total peripheral resistance. Elevated plasma renins are reduced. Doses of labetalol HCl that controlled hypertension did not affect renal function in mildly to severely 
hypertensive patients with normal renal function. Due to the alpha 1 -receptor blocking activity of labetalol HCl, blood pressure is lowered more in the standing than in the supine position, and 
symptoms of postural hypotension (2%), including rare instances of syncope, can occur. Following oral administration, when postural hypotension has occurred, it has been transient and is uncommon when
the recommended starting dose and titration increments are closely followed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Symptomatic postural hypotension is most likely to occur 2 to 4 hours after a dose, 
especially following the use of large initial doses or upon large changes in dose. LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: The peak effects of single oral doses of labetalol HCl occur within 2 to 4 hours. 
The duration of effect depends upon dose, lasting at least 8 hours following single oral doses of 100 mg and more than 12 hours following single oral doses of 300 mg. The maximum, steady-state blood 
pressure response upon oral, twice-a-day dosing occurs within 24 to 72 hours. The antihypertensive effect of labetalol has a linear correlation with the logarithm of labetalol plasma concentration, 
and there is also a linear correlation between the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia occurring at 2 hours after oral administration of labetalol HCl and the logarithm of the plasma 
concentration. About 70% of the maximum beta-blocking effect is present for 5 hours after the administration of a single oral dose of 400 mg with suggestion that about 40% remains at 8 hours. 
LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: The antianginal efficacy of labetalol HCl has not been studied. In 37 patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease, labetalol HCl did not increase the 
incidence or severity of angina attacks. Exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias have been reported after abrupt discontinuation of therapy with 
beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with coronary artery disease. Abrupt withdrawal of these agents in patients without coronary artery disease has resulted in transient symptoms, including 
tremulousness, sweating, palpitation, headache, and malaise. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena, among them increased sensitivity to catecholamines because of increased 
numbers of beta receptors. Although beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is useful in the treatment of angina and hypertension, there are also situations in which sympathetic stimulation is vital. 
LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: For example, in patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate ventricular function may depend on sympathetic drive. Beta-adrenergic blockade may worsen A-V block by
preventing the necessary facilitating effects of sympathetic activity on conduction. Beta 2 -adrenergic blockade results in passive bronchial constriction by interfering with endogenous adrenergic 
bronchodilator activity in patients subject to bronchospasm, and it may also interfere with exogenous bronchodilators in such patients. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Labetalol HCl is completely 
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract with peak plasma levels occurring 1 to 2 hours after oral administration. The relative bioavailability of labetalol HCl tablets compared to an oral solution is
100%. The absolute bioavailability (fraction of drug reaching systemic circulation) of labetalol when compared to an IV infusion is 25%; this is due to extensive "first-pass" metabolism. LABETALOL: 
clinical_pharmacology: Despite "first-pass" metabolism, there is a linear relationship between oral doses of 100 to 3,000 mg and peak plasma levels. The absolute bioavailability of labetalol is 
increased when administered with food. The plasma half-life of labetalol following oral administration is about 6 to 8 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of labetalol during repetitive dosing are 
reached by about the third day of dosing. In patients with decreased hepatic or renal function, the elimination half-life of labetalol is not altered; however, the relative bioavailability in 
hepatically impaired patients is increased due to decreased "first-pass" metabolism. The metabolism of labetalol is mainly through conjugation to glucuronide metabolites. These metabolites are present
in plasma and are excreted in the urine and, via the bile, into the feces.

The question was whether LABETALOL increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. After consulting with FDAHandler, the response indicated that the LABETALOL label does not specifically mention an 
increase or decrease in the risk of renal failure. However, it is noted that doses of labetalol that controlled hypertension did not affect renal function in patients with normal renal function. This 
information suggests that in the context of hypertension control, labetalol does not adversely affect renal function in patients with normal renal function. Nonetheless, the label advises monitoring 
conditions such as impaired renal function in patients with concomitant illnesses. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to definitively state whether LABETALOL 
increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
