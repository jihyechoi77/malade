CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics The assay used to measure amphotericin B in the blood after the administration of ABELCET ® does not distinguish 
amphotericin B that is complexed with the phospholipids of ABELCET ® from amphotericin B that is uncomplexed. The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B after the administration of ABELCET ® are 
nonlinear. Volume of distribution and clearance from blood increase with increasing dose of ABELCET ® , resulting in less than proportional increases in blood concentrations of amphotericin B over a 
dose range of 0.6-5 mg/kg/day. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B in whole blood after the administration of ABELCET ® and amphotericin B desoxycholate are:

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate 
patients), of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 
patients were treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with 
ABELCET ® , 9% discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient 
chills and/or fever during infusion of the drug. AMPHOTERICIN B: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14

ANSWER: The available information from the AMPHOTERICIN B label does not specifically mention angioedema as a risk associated with the use of the drug. However, it does report an incidence rate of 
anaphylaxis of less than 0.1% with ABELCET®, which is a formulation of amphotericin B. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can include symptoms such as angioedema, but the specific 
occurrence of angioedema is not detailed in the provided extracts.

2. FDAHandler responded that the AMPHOTERICIN B label does not specifically mention angioedema as a risk.
3. FDAHandler did mention that anaphylaxis, which can include symptoms such as angioedema, has an incidence rate of less than 0.1% with ABELCET, a formulation of amphotericin B.

symptoms such as angioedema, associated with the use of ABELCET, a formulation of amphotericin B. Therefore, while angioedema is not explicitly listed, it may occur as part of an anaphylactic reaction
