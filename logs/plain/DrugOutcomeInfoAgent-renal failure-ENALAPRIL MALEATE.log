CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: general_precautions: General Aortic Stenosis/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy As with all vasodilators, enalapril should be given with caution to patients with obstruction in 
the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible 
individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
including enalapril maleate, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). In clinical studies in 
hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 20 percent of patients. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: 
general_precautions: These increases were almost always reversible upon discontinuation of enalapril and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients renal function should be monitored during the first few 
weeks of therapy. Some patients with hypertension or heart failure with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and 
transient, especially when enalapril maleate has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or 
discontinuation of the diuretic and/or enalapril maleate may be required. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or heart failure should always include assessment of renal function ( see DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION ). Hyperkalemia Elevated serum potassium (greater than 5.7 mEq/L) was observed in approximately 1 percent of hypertensive patients in clinical trials. In most cases these were isolated 
values which resolved despite continued therapy. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: general_precautions: Hyperkalemia was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in 0.28 percent of hypertensive patients. In clinical 
trials in heart failure, hyperkalemia was observed in 3.8 percent of patients but was not a cause for discontinuation. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, 
diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes, which should be used cautiously, if at all, with 
enalapril maleate (see Drug Interactions ). Cough Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE 
inhibitors, always resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: general_precautions: 
Surgery/Anesthesia In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, enalapril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release.
If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion.

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: Studies in dogs indicate that enalapril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly, if at all; enalaprilat does not enter the brain. Multiple doses of 
enalapril maleate in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues. Milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14 C-enalapril maleate. Radioactivity was found to 
cross the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant hamsters. Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Hypertension Administration of enalapril maleate to patients with hypertension 
of severity ranging from mild to severe results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure usually with no orthostatic component. Symptomatic postural hypotension is therefore 
infrequent, although it might be anticipated in volume-depleted patients (see WARNINGS, Hypotension ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: In most patients studied, after oral administration of 
a single dose of enalapril, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by four to six hours. At recommended doses, antihypertensive effects 
have been maintained for at least 24 hours. In some patients the effects may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Hypertension ). In some patients 
achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require several weeks of therapy. The antihypertensive effects of enalapril maleate have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of 
enalapril maleate has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a 
reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with an increase in cardiac output and little or no change in heart rate. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: Following administration of enalapril 
maleate, there is an increase in renal blood flow; glomerular filtration rate is usually unchanged. The effects appear to be similar in patients with renovascular hypertension. When given together 
with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate are approximately additive. In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to 
hypertensive patients receiving enalapril maleate. In this study there was no evidence of a blunting of the antihypertensive action of enalapril maleate (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Heart 
Failure In trials in patients treated with digitalis and diuretics, treatment with enalapril resulted in decreased systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and 
heart size, and increased cardiac output and exercise tolerance. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: Heart rate was unchanged or slightly reduced, and mean ejection fraction was unchanged or 
increased. There was a beneficial effect on severity of heart failure as measured by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and on symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue. Hemodynamic effects 
were observed after the first dose and appeared to be maintained in uncontrolled studies lasting as long as four months. Effects on exercise tolerance, heart size, and severity and symptoms of heart 
failure were observed in placebo-controlled studies lasting from eight weeks to over one year. Heart Failure, Mortality Trials In a multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 2,569 patients with 
all degrees of symptomatic heart failure and ejection fraction â‰¤35 percent were randomized to placebo or enalapril and followed for up to 55 months (SOLVD-Treatment). Use of enalapril was associated 
with an 11 percent reduction in all-cause mortality and a 30 percent reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: Diseases that excluded patients from 
enrollment in the study included severe stable angina (>2 attacks/day), hemodynamically significant valvular or outflow tract obstruction, renal failure (creatinine >2.5 mg/dL), cerebrovascular 
disease (e.g., significant carotid artery disease), advanced pulmonary disease, malignancies, active myocarditis and constrictive pericarditis. The mortality benefit associated with enalapril does not
appear to depend upon digitalis being present. A second multicenter trial used the SOLVD protocol for study of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. SOLVD-Prevention patients, who had left 
ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤35 percent and no history of symptomatic heart failure, were randomized to placebo (n=2,117) or enalapril (n=2,111) and followed for up to 5 years. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: The majority of patients in the SOLVD-Prevention trial had a history of ischemic heart disease. A history of myocardial infarction was present in 80 percent of patients, current
angina pectoris in 34 percent, and a history of hypertension in 37 percent. No statistically significant mortality effect was demonstrated in this population. Enalapril-treated subjects had 32 percent
fewer first hospitalizations for heart failure, and 32 percent fewer total heart failure hospitalizations. Compared to placebo, 32 percent fewer patients receiving enalapril developed symptoms of 
overt heart failure. Hospitalizations for cardiovascular reasons were also reduced. There was an insignificant reduction in hospitalizations for any cause in the enalapril treatment group (for 
enalapril vs. placebo, respectively, 1166 vs. 1201 first hospitalizations, 2649 vs. 2840 total hospitalizations), although the study was not powered to look for such an effect.

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are
effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate and thiazides are approximately 
additive. Heart Failure Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients 
enalapril maleate improves symptoms, increases survival, and decreases the frequency of hospitalization (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of 
survival trials). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 
â‰¤35 percent), enalapril maleate tablets, USP decreases the rate of development of overt heart failure and decreases the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart
Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of survival trials). In using enalapril maleate, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 
captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that enalapril maleate does not 
have a similar risk (see WARNINGS , Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: In considering use of enalapril maleate, it should be noted that in controlled clinical 
trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, it should be noted that black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been 
reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ).

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or 
without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or
ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with 
abdominal pain. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and 
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening 
anaphylactoid reactions. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent 
rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. 
Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension Excessive hypotension is rare in uncomplicated 
hypertensive patients treated with enalapril maleate alone. Patients with heart failure given enalapril maleate commonly have some reduction in blood pressure, especially with the first dose, but 
discontinuation of therapy for continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed; caution should be observed when initiating therapy (see DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Patients at risk for excessive hypotension, sometimes associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or 
death, include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure, hyponatremia, high-dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive diuresis or increase in diuretic dose, renal dialysis, 
or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology. It may be advisable to eliminate the diuretic (except in patients with heart failure), reduce the diuretic dose or increase salt intake 
cautiously before initiating therapy with enalapril maleate in patients at risk for excessive hypotension who are able to tolerate such adjustments (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE 
REACTIONS ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: In patients at risk for excessive hypotension, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision and such patients should be followed closely for
the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of enalapril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations may apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease, in whom 
an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident. If excessive hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in the supine position and, if 
necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses of enalapril maleate, which usually can be given without 
difficulty once the blood pressure has stabilized. If symptomatic hypotension develops, a dose reduction or discontinuation of enalapril maleate or concomitant diuretic may be necessary. ENALAPRIL 
MALEATE: warnings: Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated 
patients but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen vascular disease. Available data from clinical trials of enalapril are insufficient to show that
enalapril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates. Marketing experience has revealed cases of neutropenia or agranulocytosis in which a causal relationship to enalapril cannot be excluded. 
Periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in patients with collagen vascular disease and renal disease should be considered. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a 
syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood.

        Question: Does ENALAPRIL MALEATE increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether ENALAPRIL MALEATE increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler responded that Enalapril Maleate can be associated with changes in renal function, which may lead to an increased risk of renal failure in susceptible individuals, particularly in 
patients with severe heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Treatment with Enalapril Maleate in these patients may be associated 
with oliguria, progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. Increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in 20 percent of hypertensive patients with 
renal artery stenosis, although these increases were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. In patients with hypertension or heart failure without apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease, 
increases in blood urea and serum creatinine were usually minor and transient, especially when Enalapril Maleate was given with a diuretic. The risk is higher in patients with pre-existing renal 
impairment, and renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy.
        -----
        Final answer: ENALAPRIL MALEATE can increase the risk of renal failure, particularly in susceptible individuals such as those with severe heart failure or pre-existing renal impairment. 
Monitoring of renal function is recommended during the first few weeks of therapy.

ENALAPRIL MALEATE can increase the risk of renal failure, particularly in susceptible individuals such as those with severe heart failure or pre-existing renal impairment. Monitoring of renal function
is recommended during the first few weeks of therapy. This information is based on the response from FDAHandler, which referenced the ENALAPRIL MALEATE label indicating that changes in renal function 
associated with the drug may lead to an increased risk of renal failure in certain patients.
