CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE ABELCET ® is indicated for the treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of 
conventional amphotericin B therapy. This is based on open-label treatment of patients judged by their physicians to be intolerant to or failing conventional amphotericin B therapy (See DESCRIPTION OF
CLINICAL STUDIES). DESCRIPTION OF CLINICAL STUDIES Fungal Infections Data from 473 patients were pooled from three open-label studies in which ABELCET ® was provided for the treatment of patients with
invasive fungal infections who were judged by their physicians to be refractory to or intolerant of conventional amphotericin B, or who had preexisting nephrotoxicity. Results of these studies 
demonstrated effectiveness of ABELCET ® in the treatment of invasive fungal infections as a second line therapy. AMPHOTERICIN B: indications_and_usage: Patients were defined by their individual 
physician as being refractory to or failing conventional amphotericin B therapy based on overall clinical judgement after receiving a minimum total dose of 500 mg of amphotericin B. Nephrotoxicity was
defined as a serum creatinine that had increased to >2.5 mg/dL in adults and >1.5 mg/dL in pediatric patients, or a creatinine clearance of <25 mL/min while receiving conventional amphotericin B 
therapy. Of the 473 patients, four were enrolled more than once; each enrollment contributed separately to the denominator. The median age was 39 years (range of <1 to 93 years); 307 patients were 
male and 166 female. Patients were Caucasian (381, 81%), African-American (41, 9%), Hispanic (27, 6%), Asian (10, 2%), and various other races (14, 3%). AMPHOTERICIN B: indications_and_usage: The 
median baseline neutrophil count was 4,000 PMN/mm3; of these, 101 (21%) had a baseline neutrophil count <500/mm 3 . Two-hundred eighty-two patients of the 473 patients were considered evaluable for 
response to therapy; the other 191 patients were excluded on the basis of unconfirmed diagnosis, confounding factors, concomitant systemic antifungal therapy, or receiving 4 doses or less of ABELCET ®
. For evaluable patients, the following fungal infections were treated (n=282): aspergillosis (n=111), candidiasis (n=87), zygomycosis (n=25), cryptococcosis (n=16), and fusariosis (n=11). There were 
fewer than 10 evaluable patients for each of several other fungal species treated. For each type of fungal infection listed above there were some patients successfully treated. AMPHOTERICIN B: 
indications_and_usage: However, in the absence of controlled studies it is unknown how response would have compared to either continuing conventional amphotericin B therapy or the use of alternative 
antifungal agents. Renal Function: Patients with aspergillosis who initiated treatment with ABELCET ® when serum creatinine was above 2.5 mg/dL experienced a decline in serum creatinine during 
treatment (Figure 1). Serum creatinine levels were also lower during treatment with ABELCET ® when compared to the serum creatinine levels of patients treated with conventional amphotericin B in a 
retrospective historical control study. Meaningful statistical testing of the differences between these two groups is precluded since these data were obtained from two separate studies. [ ]= Number of
patients at each time point. Note: These curves do not represent the clinical course of a given patient, but that of an open-label cohort of patients. [ ]= Number of patients at each time point. 
AMPHOTERICIN B: indications_and_usage: Note: These curves do not represent the clinical course of a given patient, but that of an open-label cohort of patients. In a randomized study of ABELCET ® for 
the treatment of invasive candidiasis in patients with normal baseline renal function, the incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly less for ABELCET ® at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day than for 
conventional amphotericin B at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day. Despite generally less nephrotoxicity of ABELCET ® observed at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day compared with conventional amphotericin B therapy at a dose
range of 0.6-1 mg/kg/day, dose-limiting renal toxicity may still be observed with ABELCET ® . Renal toxicity of doses greater than 5 mg/kg/day of ABELCET ® has not been formally studied. AMPHOTERICIN

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: 9 ± 0.4 (n=8) c 9.6 ± 2.5 (n=8) a Data from patients with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Infusion rate was 0.25 mg/kg/h. b Data from studies in patients 
with cytologically proven cancer being treated with chemotherapy or neutropenic patients with presumed or proven fungal infection. Infusion rate was 2.5 mg/kg/h. c Data from patients with 
mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Infusion rate was 4 mg/kg/h. d Percentage of dose excreted in 24 hours after last dose. The large volume of distribution and high clearance from blood of amphotericin B 
after the admistration of ABELCET ® probably reflect uptake by tissues. The long terminal elimination half-life probably reflects a slow redistribution from tissues. AMPHOTERICIN B: 
clinical_pharmacology: Although amphotericin B is excreted slowly, there is little accumulation in the blood after repeated dosing. AUC of amphotericin B increased approximately 34% from day 1 after 
the administration of ABELCET ® 5 mg/kg/day for 7 days. The effect of gender or ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of ABELCET ® has not been studied. Tissue concentrations of amphotericin B have been 
obtained at autopsy from one heart transplant patient who received three doses of ABELCET ® at 5.3 mg/kg/day: Concentration in Human Tissues Organ Amphotericin B Tissue Concentration (µg/g) Spleen

in dogs in which greatest concentrations of amphotericin B after ABELCET ® administration were observed in the liver, spleen, and lung; however, the relationship of tissue concentrations of 
amphotericin B to its biological activity when administered as ABELCET ® is unknown. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic impairment on the disposition of ABELCET ® is not 
known. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of ABELCET ® is not known. The effect of dialysis on the elimination of ABELCET ® has not been studied; however, amphotericin
B is not removed by hemodialysis when administered as amphotericin B desoxycholate. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: Pediatric and Elderly Patients: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
pediatric patients (≤16 years of age) and elderly patients (≥65 years of age) have not been studied.

the mother.

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics The assay used to measure amphotericin B in the blood after the administration of ABELCET ® does not distinguish 
amphotericin B that is complexed with the phospholipids of ABELCET ® from amphotericin B that is uncomplexed. The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B after the administration of ABELCET ® are 
nonlinear. Volume of distribution and clearance from blood increase with increasing dose of ABELCET ® , resulting in less than proportional increases in blood concentrations of amphotericin B over a 
dose range of 0.6-5 mg/kg/day. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B in whole blood after the administration of ABELCET ® and amphotericin B desoxycholate are:

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate 
patients), of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 
patients were treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with 
ABELCET ® , 9% discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient 
chills and/or fever during infusion of the drug. AMPHOTERICIN B: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14

ANSWER: Amphotericin B does increase the risk of renal failure. The adverse reactions table for Amphotericin B lists "Increased Serum Creatinine" with an incidence of 11% among patients, which is an 
indicator of renal impairment. Additionally, "Kidney Failure" is reported as an adverse event with an incidence of 5%. However, it is important to note that the causal association between these 
adverse events and Amphotericin B is uncertain.
