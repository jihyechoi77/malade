CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: general_precautions: General : Captopril : Impaired Renal Function : Some patients with renal disease, particularly those with severe renal artery stenosis, have developed 
increases in BUN and serum creatinine after reduction of blood pressure with captopril. Captopril dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of diuretic may be required. For some of these patients, it 
may not be possible to normalize blood pressure and maintain adequate renal perfusion (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , ADVERSE REACTIONS: Altered Laboratory Findings ). 
Hyperkalemia : Elevations in serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including captopril. CAPTOPRIL: general_precautions: When treated with ACE inhibitors, 
patients at risk for the development of hyperkalemia include those with: renal insufficiency; diabetes mellitus; and those using concomitant potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or 
potassium-containing salt substitutes; or other drugs associated with increases in serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and Drug Interactions: Captopril ; ADVERSE REACTIONS: 
Altered Laboratory Findings .) Cough : Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always 
resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Surgery/Anesthesia : In patients undergoing major surgery or during
anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, captopril will block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. CAPTOPRIL: general_precautions: If hypotension occurs and is 
considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis : Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) 
reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different 
type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure ). Hydrochlorothiazide : Periodic determination of serum 
electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or 
electrolyte imbalance, namely: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General : Captopril : Impaired Renal Function : Some patients with renal 
disease, particularly those with severe renal artery stenosis, have developed increases in BUN and serum creatinine after reduction of blood pressure with captopril. Captopril dosage reduction and/or 
discontinuation of diuretic may be required. For some of these patients, it may not be possible to normalize blood pressure and maintain adequate renal perfusion (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , DOSAGE

captopril.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Swelling confined to the face, mucous membranes of the mouth, lips and extremities has usually resolved with discontinuation of treatment; some cases required medical 
therapy. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Captopril .) Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These 
patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was 
diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential 
diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization : Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with 
hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, 
but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure : Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and 
treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. 
Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis : Neutropenia (< 1000/mm 3 ) with myeloid hypoplasia has resulted from use of captopril. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: About half of the neutropenic patients developed systemic or 
oral cavity infections or other features of the syndrome of agranulocytosis. The risk of neutropenia is dependent on the clinical status of the patient: In clinical trials in patients with 
hypertension who have normal renal function (serum creatinine less than 1.6 mg/dL and no collagen vascular disease), neutropenia has been seen in one patient out of over 8,600 exposed. In patients 
with some degree of renal failure (serum creatinine at least 1.6 mg/dL) but no collagen vascular disease, the risk of neutropenia in clinical trials was about 1 per 500, a frequency over 15 times that
for uncomplicated hypertension. Daily doses of captopril were relatively high in these patients, particularly in view of their diminished renal function. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: In foreign marketing 
experience in patients with renal failure, use of allopurinol concomitantly with captopril has been associated with neutropenia but this association has not appeared in U.S. reports. In patients with 
collagen vascular diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma) and impaired renal function, neutropenia occurred in 3.7 percent of patients in clinical trials. While none of the over 750
patients in formal clinical trials of heart failure developed neutropenia, it has occurred during the subsequent clinical experience. About half of the reported cases had serum creatinine ≥ 1.6 mg/dL 
and more than 75 percent were in patients also receiving procainamide. In heart failure, it appears that the same risk factors for neutropenia are present. The neutropenia has usually been detected 
within three months after captopril was started. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Bone marrow examinations in patients with neutropenia consistently showed myeloid hypoplasia, frequently accompanied by erythroid 
hypoplasia and decreased numbers of megakaryocytes (e.g., hypoplastic bone marrow and pancytopenia); anemia and thrombocytopenia were sometimes seen. In general, neutrophils returned to normal in 
about two weeks after captopril was discontinued, and serious infections were limited to clinically complex patients. About 13 percent of the cases of neutropenia have ended fatally, but almost all 
fatalities were in patients with serious illness, having collagen vascular disease, renal failure, heart failure or immunosuppressant therapy, or a combination of these complicating factors. 
Evaluation of the hypertensive or heart failure patient should always include assessment of renal function. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: If captopril is used in patients with impaired renal function, white 
blood cell and differential counts should be evaluated prior to starting treatment and at approximately two-week intervals for about three months, then periodically. In patients with collagen vascular
disease or who are exposed to other drugs known to affect the white cells or immune response, particularly when there is impaired renal function, captopril should be used only after an assessment of 
benefit and risk, and then with caution. All patients treated with captopril should be told to report any signs of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever). If infection is suspected, white cell counts 
should be performed without delay. Since discontinuation of captopril and other drugs has generally led to prompt return of the white count to normal, upon confirmation of neutropenia (neutrophil 
count < 1000/mm 3 ) the physician should withdraw captopril and closely follow the patient’s course. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Proteinuria : Total urinary proteins greater than 1 g per day were seen in 
about 0.7 percent of patients receiving captopril. About 90 percent of affected patients had evidence of prior renal disease or received relatively high doses of captopril (in excess of 150 mg/day), 
or both. The nephrotic syndrome occurred in about one-fifth of proteinuric patients. In most cases, proteinuria subsided or cleared within six months whether or not captopril was continued. Parameters
of renal function, such as BUN and creatinine, were seldom altered in the patients with proteinuria. Hypotension : Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in hypertensive patients but is a possible 
consequence of captopril use in salt/volume depleted persons (such as those treated vigorously with diuretics), patients with heart failure or those patients undergoing renal dialysis. (See 
PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions . CAPTOPRIL: warnings: ) Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality : ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. 
Several dozen cases have been reported in the world literature. When pregnancy is detected, ACE inhibitors should be discontinued as soon as possible. The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and 
third trimesters of pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death. 
Oligohydramnios has also been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal function; oligohydramnios in this setting has been associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial 
deformation, and hypoplastic lung development. Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences 
were due to the ACE-inhibitor exposure. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester.
Mothers whose embryos and fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant, physicians should make every effort 
to discontinue the use of captopril as soon as possible. Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the 
mothers should be apprised of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, 
captopril should be discontinued unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a non-stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, 
depending upon the week of pregnancy.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Captopril : Reported incidences are based on clinical trials involving approximately 7000 patients. Renal : About one of 100 patients developed
proteinuria (see WARNINGS ). Each of the following has been reported in approximately 1 to 2 of 1000 patients and are of uncertain relationship to drug use: renal insufficiency, renal failure, 
nephrotic syndrome, polyuria, oliguria, and urinary frequency. Hematologic : Neutropenia/agranulocytosis has occurred (see WARNINGS ). Cases of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been 
reported. Dermatologic : Rash, often with pruritus, and sometimes with fever, arthralgia, and eosinophilia, occurred in about 4 to 7 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients, usually 
during the first four weeks of therapy. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: It is usually maculopapular, and rarely urticarial. The rash is usually mild and disappears within a few days of dosage reduction,
short-term treatment with an antihistaminic agent, and/or discontinuing therapy; remission may occur even if captopril is continued. Pruritus, without rash, occurs in about 2 of 100 patients. Between 
7 and 10 percent of patients with skin rash have shown eosinophilia and/or positive ANA titers. A reversible associated pemphigoid-like lesion, and photosensitivity, have also been reported. Flushing 
or pallor has been reported in 2 to 5 of 1000 patients. Cardiovascular : Hypotension may occur; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (Drug Interactions) for discussion of hypotension with captopril therapy. 
Tachycardia, chest pain, and palpitations have each been observed in approximately 1 of 100 patients. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, Raynaud’s syndrome, and 
congestive heart failure have each occurred in 2 to 3 of 1000 patients. Dysgeusia : Approximately 2 to 4 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients developed a diminution or loss of taste 
perception. Taste impairment is reversible and usually self-limited (2 to 3 months) even with continued drug administration. Weight loss may be associated with the loss of taste. Angioedema : 
Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in approximately one in 1000 patients. Angioedema involving the upper airways has caused
fatal airway obstruction. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Cough : Cough has been
reported in 0.5 to 2% of patients treated with captopril in clinical trials (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Captopril: Cough ). The following have been reported in about 0.5 to 2 percent of patients but 
did not appear at increased frequency compared to placebo or other treatments used in controlled trials: gastric irritation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, 
aphthous ulcers, peptic ulcer, dizziness, headache, malaise, fatigue, insomnia, dry mouth, dyspnea, alopecia, paresthesias. Other clinical adverse effects reported since the drug was marketed are 
listed below by body system. In this setting, an incidence or causal relationship cannot be accurately determined. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Body as a Whole : Anaphylactoid reactions (see 
WARNINGS: Captopril: Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). General : asthenia, gynecomastia. Cardiovascular : cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular 
accident/insufficiency, rhythm disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, syncope. Dermatologic : bullous pemphigus, erythema multiforme (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), exfoliative dermatitis. 
Gastrointestinal : pancreatitis, glossitis, dyspepsia. Hematologic : anemia, including aplastic and hemolytic. Hepatobiliary : jaundice, hepatitis, including rare cases of necrosis, cholestasis.

ANSWER: Captopril can potentially increase the risk of renal failure in some patients. Specifically, patients with renal disease, particularly those with severe renal artery stenosis, have developed 
increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine after a reduction in blood pressure with captopril, which may necessitate a reduction in captopril dosage or discontinuation of diuretic 
treatment. In some cases, it may not be possible to normalize blood pressure and maintain adequate renal perfusion. Additionally, about one in 1000 patients developed renal insufficiency or renal 
failure, and the nephrotic syndrome occurred in about one-fifth of proteinuric patients. However, in most cases, proteinuria subsided or cleared within six months, whether or not captopril was 
continued, and parameters of renal function, such as BUN and creatinine, were seldom altered in patients with proteinuria.

2. FDAHandler responded that CAPTOPRIL can potentially increase the risk of renal failure in some patients, particularly in those with severe renal artery stenosis. After a reduction in blood pressure
with captopril, increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine may occur, which might necessitate a reduction in captopril dosage or discontinuation of diuretic treatment. In some cases,

        Final answer: CAPTOPRIL can potentially increase the risk of renal failure in some patients, especially those with pre-existing renal disease or severe renal artery stenosis. However, the 
condition is not common, with about one in 1000 patients developing renal insufficiency or renal failure. In most cases, proteinuria associated with captopril use subsided or cleared within six
