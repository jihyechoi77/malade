CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: boxed_warning: Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, 
adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of desipramine hydrochloride tablets or any other 
antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants 
compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are 
themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical 
worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. DESIPRAMINE: boxed_warning: Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. 
Desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients ( See WARNINGS: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk , PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients , and PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use .

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with desipramine hydrochloride or within 14 days of stopping treatment with 
desipramine hydrochloride is contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of desipramine hydrochloride within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric 
disorders is also contraindicated ( see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Starting desipramine hydrochloride in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous 
methylene blue is also contraindicated because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Desipramine hydrochloride is contraindicated in the acute 
recovery period following myocardial infarction. It should not be used in those who have shown prior hypersensitivity to the drug. DESIPRAMINE: contraindications: Cross-sensitivity between this and 
other dibenzazepines is a possibility.

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: warnings: WARNINGS Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression 
and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until 
significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a 
long- standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. 
DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and others) showed that these drugs increase the
risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies 
did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 
and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term 
trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 patients. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: The pooled analyses of placebo- controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 
295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an 
increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk 
differences (drug vs placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 
patients treated) are provided in Table 1 . DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo 
<18 14 additional cases 18-24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer case â‰¥65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the 
adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several 
months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. DESIPRAMINE:
warnings: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in 
behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, 
insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with 
antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the 
worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. DESIPRAMINE: warnings:
Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent
suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting 
symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the 
need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such 
symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for desipramine hydrochloride should be written for the 
smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive 
episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may 
increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However,
prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should 
include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in treating 
bipolar depression. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Serotonin Syndrome: The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors 
(SNRIs) and SSRIs, including desipramine hydrochloride, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, 
tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such 
as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., 
tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular changes (e.g. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), 
seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. The concomitant use of desipramine hydrochloride 
with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Desipramine hydrochloride should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or 
intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No 
reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: There may be circumstances when it is 
necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking desipramine hydrochloride. Desipramine hydrochloride should be discontinued before 
initiating treatment with the MAOI ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If concomitant use of desipramine hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic 
antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome 
particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with desipramine hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events 
occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Angle-Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including 
desipramine hydrochloride may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. General Extreme caution should be used when this drug 
is given in the following situations: In patients with cardiovascular disease, because of the possibility of conduction defects, arrhythmias, tachycardias, strokes, and acute myocardial infarction. In
patients who have a family history of sudden death, cardiac dysrhythmias, or cardiac conduction disturbances. In patients with a history of urinary retention or glaucoma, because of the 
anticholinergic properties of the drug. In patients with thyroid disease or those taking thyroid medication, because of the possibility of cardiovascular toxicity, including arrhythmias. In patients 
with a history of seizure disorder, because this drug has been shown to lower the seizure threshold. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Seizures precede cardiac dysrhythmias and death in some patients. This drug 
is capable of blocking the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds. The patient should be cautioned that this drug may impair the mental and/or physical abilities 
required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it should be borne in mind that the potentiation 
may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage. Pregnancy There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in woman exposed to antidepressants, including 
desipramine hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or 
visiting online at http://womensmentalhealth. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: /clinical-and-research- programs/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants Safe use of desipramine hydrochloride during pregnancy and 
lactation has not been established; therefore, if it is to be given to pregnant patients, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential, the possible benefits must be weighed against the 
possible hazards to mother and child. Animal reproductive studies have been inconclusive. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desipramine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 
aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger 
patients. Lower doses are recommended for elderly patients. ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) The ratio of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the elderly, most likely due to 
decreased renal elimination with aging. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients 
with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 
Desipramine hydrochloride use in the elderly has been associated with a proneness to falling as well as confusional states (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .

and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions Read the Medication Guide that comes with your, or your family member's, antidepressant medicine. This Medication Guide is only about the risk of suicidal thoughts and
actions with antidepressant medicines. Talk to your, or your family member's, healthcare provider about: all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines all treatment choices for 
depression or other serious mental illness What is the most important information I should know about antidepressant medicines, depression and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or 
actions? Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. Depression and other serious mental 
illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. DESIPRAMINE: spl_medguide: Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include
people who have (or have a family history of) bipolar illness (also called manic- depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and 
actions in myself or a family member? Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings.This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is
started or when the dose is changed. Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare 
provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms. Who should not take desipramine hydrochloride tablets, USP? You should not
take desipramine hydrochloride tablets, USP if you take a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). DESIPRAMINE: spl_medguide: Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are not sure if you take an 
MAOI, including the antibiotic linezolid. Do not take an MAOI within 2 weeks of stopping desipramine hydrochloride tablets, USP unless directed to do so by your physician. Do not start desipramine 
hydrochloride tablets, USP if you stopped taking an MAOI in the last 2 weeks unless directed to do so by your physician.

patients treated) are provided in Table 1 . DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo 
<18 14 additional cases 18-24 5 additional cases Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer case â‰¥65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the 
adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several 
months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. DESIPRAMINE:
warnings: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in 
behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, 
insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with 
antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the 
worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. DESIPRAMINE: warnings:
Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent
suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting 
symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the 
need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such 
symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for desipramine hydrochloride should be written for the 
smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive 
episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may 
increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However,
prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should 
include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in treating 
bipolar depression. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Serotonin Syndrome: The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors 
(SNRIs) and SSRIs, including desipramine hydrochloride, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, 
tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such 
as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., 
tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular changes (e.g. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), 
seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. The concomitant use of desipramine hydrochloride 
with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Desipramine hydrochloride should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or 
intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No 
reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: There may be circumstances when it is 
necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking desipramine hydrochloride. Desipramine hydrochloride should be discontinued before 
initiating treatment with the MAOI ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If concomitant use of desipramine hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic 
antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome 
particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with desipramine hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events 
occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Angle-Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including 
desipramine hydrochloride may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. General Extreme caution should be used when this drug 
is given in the following situations: In patients with cardiovascular disease, because of the possibility of conduction defects, arrhythmias, tachycardias, strokes, and acute myocardial infarction. In
patients who have a family history of sudden death, cardiac dysrhythmias, or cardiac conduction disturbances. In patients with a history of urinary retention or glaucoma, because of the 
anticholinergic properties of the drug. In patients with thyroid disease or those taking thyroid medication, because of the possibility of cardiovascular toxicity, including arrhythmias. In patients 
with a history of seizure disorder, because this drug has been shown to lower the seizure threshold. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Seizures precede cardiac dysrhythmias and death in some patients. This drug 
is capable of blocking the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds. The patient should be cautioned that this drug may impair the mental and/or physical abilities 
required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it should be borne in mind that the potentiation 
may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage. Pregnancy There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in woman exposed to antidepressants, including 
desipramine hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or 
visiting online at http://womensmentalhealth. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: /clinical-and-research- programs/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants Safe use of desipramine hydrochloride during pregnancy and 
lactation has not been established; therefore, if it is to be given to pregnant patients, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential, the possible benefits must be weighed against the 
possible hazards to mother and child. Animal reproductive studies have been inconclusive. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desipramine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 
aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger 
patients. Lower doses are recommended for elderly patients. ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) The ratio of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the elderly, most likely due to 
decreased renal elimination with aging. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients 
with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 
Desipramine hydrochloride use in the elderly has been associated with a proneness to falling as well as confusional states (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .

and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions Read the Medication Guide that comes with your, or your family member's, antidepressant medicine. This Medication Guide is only about the risk of suicidal thoughts and
actions with antidepressant medicines. Talk to your, or your family member's, healthcare provider about: all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines all treatment choices for 
depression or other serious mental illness What is the most important information I should know about antidepressant medicines, depression and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or 
actions? Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. Depression and other serious mental 
illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. DESIPRAMINE: spl_medguide: Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include
people who have (or have a family history of) bipolar illness (also called manic- depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and 
actions in myself or a family member? Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings.This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is
started or when the dose is changed. Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare 
provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms. Who should not take desipramine hydrochloride tablets, USP? You should not
take desipramine hydrochloride tablets, USP if you take a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). DESIPRAMINE: spl_medguide: Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are not sure if you take an 
MAOI, including the antibiotic linezolid. Do not take an MAOI within 2 weeks of stopping desipramine hydrochloride tablets, USP unless directed to do so by your physician. Do not start desipramine 
hydrochloride tablets, USP if you stopped taking an MAOI in the last 2 weeks unless directed to do so by your physician.

DESIPRAMINE has been associated with an increased risk of acute liver injury. This is supported by the information provided by FDAHandler, which indicates that DESIPRAMINE has been linked with 
hepatitis, jaundice (simulating obstructive), altered liver function, and elevated liver function tests, as stated in the DESIPRAMINE label. These conditions are indicative of acute liver injury.
