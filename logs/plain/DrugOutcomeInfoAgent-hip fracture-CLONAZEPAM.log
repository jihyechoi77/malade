CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and 
those who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. 
Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, 
which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ) . Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal 
syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ). CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Since 
clonazepam tablets produce CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving
a motor vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam tablets therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: 
Information for Patients ). Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs 
for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood
or behavior. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an
increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as
one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal
thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs
of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the
clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled 
Analysis Indication Placebo Drug Patients Relative Risk: Risk Difference: Patients with with Events Per Incidence of Additional Drug Events Per 1000 Patients Events in Drug Patients with 1000 Patients
Patients/Incidence Events per 1000 in Placebo Patients Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts
or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric 
indications. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Anyone considering prescribing clonazepam tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. 
Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal 
thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, 
their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the 
signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome: Use of clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, 
lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). 
Monitor neonates exposed to clonazepam tablets during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to clonazepam tablets during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these
neonates accordingly.

thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs
of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the
clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled 
Analysis Indication Placebo Drug Patients Relative Risk: Risk Difference: Patients with with Events Per Incidence of Additional Drug Events Per 1000 Patients Events in Drug Patients with 1000 Patients
Patients/Incidence Events per 1000 in Placebo Patients Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts
or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric 
indications. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Anyone considering prescribing clonazepam tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. 
Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal 
thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, 
their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the 
signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome: Use of clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, 
lethargy, hypotonia) and/or withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in the neonate (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). 
Monitor neonates exposed to clonazepam tablets during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation and monitor neonates exposed to clonazepam tablets during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal; manage these
neonates accordingly.

ANSWER: The available information from the CLONAZEPAM label does not provide a direct answer regarding the impact of clonazepam on the risk of hip fracture. However, it does list "fracture traumatic" 
as one of the infrequent adverse events reported by patients treated with clonazepam tablets during clinical trials. Infrequent adverse events are defined as occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. 
This does not specifically address the risk of hip fractures, nor does it establish a causal relationship between clonazepam use and fractures.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether CLONAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture.
2. FDAHandler responded that the CLONAZEPAM label does not provide a direct answer regarding the impact of clonazepam on the risk of hip fracture.
3. The label does list "fracture traumatic" as an infrequent adverse event reported by patients treated with clonazepam tablets during clinical trials, which occurs in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. 
However, this does not specifically address the risk of hip fractures, nor does it establish a causal relationship between clonazepam use and fractures.

The FDA label for CLONAZEPAM does not provide a direct answer regarding the impact of clonazepam on the risk of hip fracture. It does list "fracture traumatic" as an infrequent adverse event reported 
by patients treated with clonazepam tablets during clinical trials, which occurs in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. However, this information does not specifically address the risk of hip fractures, nor 
does it establish a causal relationship between clonazepam use and fractures.
