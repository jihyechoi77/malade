CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and 
those who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. 
Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, 
which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ) . Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal 
syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ). CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Since 
clonazepam tablets produce CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving
a motor vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam tablets therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: 
Information for Patients ). Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs 
for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood
or behavior. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an
increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as
one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal
thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs
of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the
clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled 
Analysis Indication Placebo Drug Patients Relative Risk: Risk Difference: Patients with with Events Per Incidence of Additional Drug Events Per 1000 Patients Events in Drug Patients with 1000 Patients

or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric 
indications.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Do not suddenly stop taking clonazepam tablets. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual 
movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an extreme increase in activity
or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these symptoms. Some 
people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months , including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, 
problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears. 
Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not
take more clonazepam tablets than prescribed or take clonazepam tablets for longer than prescribed. Clonazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy and can slow your thinking and motor skills. This 
may get better over time. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how clonazepam tablets affect you. Clonazepam tablets may cause problems with your 
coordination, especially when you are walking or picking things up. Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking clonazepam tablets until you talk to your 
healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, clonazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Like other 
antiepileptic medicines, clonazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these 
symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic 
attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting on dangerous impulses new or worse irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) acting aggressive, being angry, or violent other unusual 
changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. 
Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: 
Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. Do not stop clonazepam tablets
without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause seizures that will not stop (status 
epilepticus). What are clonazepam tablets? Clonazepam tablets are a prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat: certain types of seizure disorders (epilepsy) in adults and 
children panic disorder with or without fear of open spaces (agoraphobia) in adults Clonazepam tablets are a federally controlled substance (C-IV) because it contains clonazepam that can be abused or 
lead to dependence. Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Selling or giving away clonazepam tablets may harm others, and is against the law. 
Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs. It is not known if clonazepam tablets are safe or effective in treating 
panic disorder in children younger than 18 years old. Who should not take clonazepam tablets? Do not take clonazepam tablets if you: are allergic to benzodiazepines have significant liver disease have
an eye disease called acute narrow angle glaucoma Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you have any of the problems listed above. Before you take clonazepam tablets, tell your 
healthcare provider if you: have liver or kidney problems have lung problems (respiratory disease) have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior have any other medical 
problems are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: WARNINGS Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, and opioids may result in profound sedation, 
respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is 
made to prescribe clonazepam tablets concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of 
respiratory depression and sedation. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when clonazepam tablets are used with opioids (see
PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction: The use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, exposes users to the risks of abuse,
misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly
involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, 
overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse ) . Before prescribing clonazepam tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g. 
CLONAZEPAM: warnings: using a standardized screening tool). Use of clonazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of clonazepam 
tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances 
associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the 
patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue 
clonazepam tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam Tablets ) .

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam tablets and observed closely (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ). Panic 
Disorder: Adults: The initial dose for adults with panic disorder is 0.25 mg twice daily. An increase to the target dose for most patients of 1 mg/day may be made after 3 days. The recommended dose of
1 mg/day is based on the results from a fixed dose study in which the optimal effect was seen at 1 mg/day. Higher doses of 2, 3 and 4 mg/day in that study were less effective than the 1 mg/day dose 
and were associated with more adverse effects. Nevertheless, it is possible that some individual patients may benefit from doses of up to a maximum dose of 4 mg/day, and in those instances, the dose 
may be increased in increments of 0.125 to 0. CLONAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: 25 mg twice daily every 3 days until panic disorder is controlled or until side effects make further increases 
undesired. To reduce the inconvenience of somnolence, administration of one dose at bedtime may be desirable. Treatment should be discontinued gradually, with a decrease of 0.125 mg twice daily every 
3 days, until the drug is completely withdrawn. There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with clonazepam should remain on it. Therefore, the 
physician who elects to use clonazepam tablets for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Pediatric Patients: There is no 
clinical trial experience with clonazepam tablets in panic disorder patients under 18 years of age. Geriatric Patients: There is no clinical trial experience with clonazepam tablets in panic disorder 
patients 65 years of age and older. CLONAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: In general, elderly patients should be started on low doses of clonazepam tablets and observed closely (see PRECAUTIONS: 
Geriatric Use ). Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam Tablets: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, increased seizure frequency, and status epilepticus, use a gradual taper to 
discontinue clonazepam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently 
decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ).

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). The use of benzodiazepines, 
including clonazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. CLONAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing clonazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue clonazepam tablets
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .

“depression” were reported as leading to discontinuation in 4% of clonazepam tablets-treated patients compared to 1% of placebo-treated patients. CLONAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: While these findings 
are noteworthy, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) data collected in these trials revealed a larger decline in HAM-D scores in the clonazepam group than the placebo group suggesting that 
clonazepam-treated patients were not experiencing a worsening or emergence of clinical depression. Other Adverse Events Observed During the Premarketing Evaluation of Clonazepam Tablets in Panic

reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, those event terms which were so general as to be 
uninformative, and events reported only once and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening. CLONAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: It is important to emphasize that, 
although the events occurred during treatment with clonazepam tablets, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing 
frequency. These adverse events were reported infrequently, which is defined as occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. CLONAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: Body as a Whole: weight increase, accident, weight

ANSWER: Clonazepam does not have a direct correlation with the risk of hospitalization mentioned in the label. However, the label warns about several serious risks associated with clonazepam use that 
could potentially lead to hospitalization if not managed properly. These include life-threatening withdrawal reactions if the drug is discontinued abruptly or the dosage is reduced rapidly, increased 
risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior, profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death when used with opioids, and the potential for abuse, misuse, and addiction which can lead to overdose 
or death. Patients are advised to not suddenly stop taking clonazepam and to seek medical attention if experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms or suicidal thoughts.

        Question: Does CLONAZEPAM increase or decrease the risk of hospitalization?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if CLONAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that the label for CLONAZEPAM does not directly correlate it with the risk of hospitalization. However, the label does warn about several serious risks associated with its use 
that could potentially lead to hospitalization if not managed properly. These include life-threatening withdrawal reactions, increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior, profound sedation, 
respiratory depression, coma, and death when used with opioids, and the potential for abuse, misuse, and addiction which can lead to overdose or death.
3. Patients are advised to not suddenly stop taking clonazepam and to seek medical attention if experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms or suicidal thoughts.
        -----
        Final answer: The FDA label for CLONAZEPAM does not directly state that it increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. However, it does warn about several serious risks that could 
potentially lead to hospitalization if not managed properly. Therefore, while there is no direct correlation mentioned, there is an implication that the risk of hospitalization could be increased due 
to these serious risks if they are not appropriately managed.
