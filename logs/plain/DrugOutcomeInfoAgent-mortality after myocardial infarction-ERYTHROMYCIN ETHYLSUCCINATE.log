CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ery-Ped should only be used to treat bacterial 
infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Ery-Ped is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better 
early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate 
treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ery-Ped or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by 
antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps 
and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: information_for_patients: If this occurs, patients should contact their 
physician as soon as possible.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: General Prescribing Ery-Ped in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to 
provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally excreted by the liver, caution should be exercised when 
erythromycin is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and WARNINGS sections.) Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of 
myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving erythromycin therapy. There have been reports of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) occurring in infants following erythromycin 
therapy. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: In one cohort of 157 newborns who were given erythromycin for pertussis prophylaxis, seven neonates (5%) developed symptoms of non-bilious 
vomiting or irritability with feeding and were subsequently diagnosed as having IHPS requiring surgical pyloromyotomy . A possible dose-response effect was described with an absolute risk of IHPS of 
5.1% for infants who took erythromycin for 8-14 days and 10% for infants who took erythromycin for 15-21 days. 2 Since erythromycin may be used in the treatment of conditions in infants which are 
associated with significant mortality or morbidity (such as pertussis or neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis infections), the benefit of erythromycin therapy needs to be weighed against the potential risk 
of developing IHPS. Parents should be informed to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: Prolonged or repeated use 
of erythromycin may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria or fungi. If superinfection occurs, erythromycin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. When indicated, 
incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Observational studies in humans have reported cardiovascular malformations after exposure
to drug products containing erythromycin during early pregnancy.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of theophylline should be reduced while the patient is receiving
concomitant erythromycin therapy. There have been published reports suggesting that when oral erythromycin is given concurrently with theophylline there is a decrease in erythromycin serum 
concentrations of approximately 35%. The mechanism by which this interaction occurs is unknown. The decrease in erythromycin concentrations due to co-administration of theophylline could result in 
subtherapeutic concentrations of erythromycin. Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent verapamil, belonging to the calcium channel 
blockers drug class. Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: There have been 
reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly. Increased anticoagulation effects due to interactions of erythromycin with various oral 
anticoagulants may be more pronounced in the elderly. Erythromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of the 3A isoform subfamily of the cytochrome p450 enzyme system (CYP3A). Coadministration of 
erythromycin and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects of the 
concomitant drug. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving 
erythromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A 
isoform are also possible. The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products in post-marketing experience: Ergotamine/dihydroergotamine Post-marketing reports 
indicate that co-administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other 
tissues including the central nervous system. Concomitant administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: 
precautions: Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as triazolam and alprazolam) and Related Benzodiazepines Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may 
increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Erythromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., lovastatin and
simvastatin). Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Sildenafil (Viagra) Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC)
of sildenafil. Reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A 
based interactions of erythromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, vinblastine, and bromocriptine. 
Concomitant administration of erythromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, there have been reports of interactions of 
erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: Erythromycin has been reported to 
significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including 
electrocardiographic QT/QT c interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other ventricular arrhythmias have been observed. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, deaths have been 
reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin. There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin was co-administered with cisapride, 
resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes most likely due to the inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by 
erythromycin. Fatalities have been reported.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Theophylline Erythromycin use in patients who are receiving high doses of theophylline may be associated with an increase in 
serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of theophylline should be reduced while the patient 
is receiving concomitant erythromycin therapy. There have been published reports suggesting that when oral erythromycin is given concurrently with theophylline there is a decrease in erythromycin

efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Erythromycin is considered a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. A significant increase in colchicine plasma concentration is anticipated when co-administered with 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin.

anticoagulants may be more pronounced in the elderly. Erythromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of the 3A isoform subfamily of the cytochrome p450 enzyme system (CYP3A). Coadministration of 
erythromycin and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects of the 
concomitant drug. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving 
erythromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A 
isoform are also possible. The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products in post-marketing experience: Ergotamine/dihydroergotamine Post-marketing reports 
indicate that co-administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other 
tissues including the central nervous system. Concomitant administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: 
precautions: Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as triazolam and alprazolam) and Related Benzodiazepines Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may 
increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Erythromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., lovastatin and
simvastatin). Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Sildenafil (Viagra) Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC)
of sildenafil. Reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A 
based interactions of erythromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, vinblastine, and bromocriptine. 
Concomitant administration of erythromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, there have been reports of interactions of 
erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: Erythromycin has been reported to 
significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including 
electrocardiographic QT/QT c interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other ventricular arrhythmias have been observed. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, deaths have been 
reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin. There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin was co-administered with cisapride, 
resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes most likely due to the inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by 
erythromycin. Fatalities have been reported.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Theophylline Erythromycin use in patients who are receiving high doses of theophylline may be associated with an increase in 
serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of theophylline should be reduced while the patient 
is receiving concomitant erythromycin therapy. There have been published reports suggesting that when oral erythromycin is given concurrently with theophylline there is a decrease in erythromycin 
serum concentrations of approximately 35%. The mechanism by which this interaction occurs is unknown. The decrease in erythromycin concentrations due to co-administration of theophylline could result 
in subtherapeutic concentrations of erythromycin. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent
verapamil, belonging to the calcium channel blockers drug class. Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels. There have been

efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Erythromycin is considered a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4. A significant increase in colchicine plasma concentration is anticipated when co-administered with 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as erythromycin.

The question was whether ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. I attempted to obtain information from FDAHandler using the 
recipient_message tool, but there was no response, indicating that the FDA label data does not specify the answer to this question. Therefore, I do not have the knowledge to answer whether 
ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE affects mortality risk post-myocardial infarction.
