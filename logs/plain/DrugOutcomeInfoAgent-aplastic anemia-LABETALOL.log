CONTENT: LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse effects are mild and transient and occur early in the course of treatment. In controlled clinical trials of 3 to 4 months' 
duration, discontinuation of labetalol hydrochloride tablets due to one or more adverse effects was required in 7% of all patients. In these same trials, other agents with solely beta-blocking 
activity used in the control groups led to discontinuation in 8% to 10% of patients, and a centrally acting alpha-agonist led to discontinuation in 30% of patients. The incidence rates of adverse 
reactions listed in the following table were derived from multicenter, controlled clinical trials comparing labetalol HCl, placebo, metoprolol, and propranolol over treatment periods of 3 and 4 
months. Where the frequency of adverse effects for labetalol HCl and placebo is similar, causal relationship is uncertain. The rates are based on adverse reactions considered probably drug related by 
the investigator. LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: If all reports are considered, the rates are somewhat higher (e.g., dizziness, 20%; nausea, 14%; fatigue, 11%), but the overall conclusions are 
unchanged. LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: Labetalol HCI Placebo Propranolol Metoprolol (n = 227) (n = 98) (n = 84) (n = 49) % % % % Body as a whole Fatigue 5 0 12 12 Asthenia 1 1 1 0 Headache 2 1 1 2

number of other less common adverse events have been reported: Body as a Whole: Fever. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, and rarely, syncope, bradycardia, heart block. Central and Peripheral Nervous 
Systems: Paresthesia, most frequently described as scalp tingling. In most cases, it was mild and transient and usually occurred at the beginning of treatment. Collagen Disorders: Systemic lupus 
erythematosus, positive antinuclear factor. Eyes: Dry eyes. Immunological System: Antimitochondrial antibodies. LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: Liver and Biliary System: Hepatic necrosis, hepatitis, 
cholestatic jaundice, elevated liver function tests. Musculoskeletal System: Muscle cramps, toxic myopathy. Respiratory System: Bronchospasm. Skin and Appendages: Rashes of various types, such as 
generalized maculopapular, lichenoid, urticarial, bullous lichen planus, psoriaform, and facial erythema; Peyronie's disease; reversible alopecia. Urinary System: Difficulty in micturition, including 
acute urinary bladder retention. Hypersensitivity: Rare reports of hypersensitivity (e.g., rash, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, dyspnea) and anaphylactoid reactions. Following approval for marketing
in the United Kingdom, a monitored release survey involving approximately 6,800 patients was conducted for further safety and efficacy evaluation of this product. LABETALOL: adverse_reactions: Results
of this survey indicate that the type, severity, and incidence of adverse effects were comparable to those cited above. Potential Adverse Effects: In addition, other adverse effects not listed above 
have been reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Central Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia, an acute reversible syndrome characterized by 
disorientation for time and place, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, slightly clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on psychometrics. Cardiovascular: Intensification of A-V block (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Allergic: Fever combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm, respiratory distress. Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenic or nonthrombocytopenic purpura. 
Gastrointestinal: Mesenteric artery thrombosis, ischemic colitis.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: warnings: WARNINGS Hepatic Injury: Severe hepatocellular injury, confirmed by rechallenge in at least one case, occurs rarely with labetalol therapy.The hepatic injury is usually 
reversible, but hepatic necrosis and death have been reported. Injury has occurred after both short- and long-term treatment and may be slowly progressive despite minimal symptomatology. Similar 
hepatic events have been reported with a related research compound, dilevalol HCl, including two deaths. Dilevalol HCl is one of the four isomers of labetalol HCl. Thus, for patients taking labetalol,
periodic determination of suitable hepatic laboratory tests would be appropriate. Appropriate laboratory testing should be done at the first symptom/sign of liver dysfunction (e.g., pruritus, dark 
urine, persistent anorexia, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, or unexplained "flu-like" symptoms). LABETALOL: warnings: If the patient has laboratory evidence of liver injury or jaundice, 
labetalol should be stopped and not restarted. Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation is a vital component supporting circulatory function in congestive heart failure. Beta-blockade carries a 
potential hazard of further depressing myocardial contractility and precipitating more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, 
labetalol HCl can be used with caution in patients with a history of heart failure who are well compensated. Congestive heart failure has been observed in patients receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol 
HCl does not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle. In Patients Without a History of Cardiac Failure : In patients with latent cardiac insufficiency, continued depression of the 
myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. LABETALOL: warnings: At the first sign or symptom of impending cardiac failure, patients should 
be fully digitalized and/or be given a diuretic, and the response should be observed closely. If cardiac failure continues despite adequate digitalization and diuretic, therapy with labetalol 
hydrochloride tablets should be withdrawn (gradually, if possible). Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal: Angina pectoris has not been reported upon labetalol HCl 
discontinuation. However, hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have 
occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered labetalol hydrochloride tablets, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage 
should be gradually reduced over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored.

CONTENT: LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: Hemodynamic effects are variable, with small, nonsignificant changes in cardiac output seen in some studies but not others, and small decreases in total 
peripheral resistance. Elevated plasma renins are reduced. Doses of labetalol HCl that controlled hypertension did not affect renal function in mildly to severely hypertensive patients with normal 
renal function. Due to the alpha 1 -receptor blocking activity of labetalol HCl, blood pressure is lowered more in the standing than in the supine position, and symptoms of postural hypotension (2%), 
including rare instances of syncope, can occur. Following oral administration, when postural hypotension has occurred, it has been transient and is uncommon when the recommended starting dose and 
titration increments are closely followed (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Symptomatic postural hypotension is most likely to occur 2 to 4 hours after a dose, especially following the use of large 
initial doses or upon large changes in dose. LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: The peak effects of single oral doses of labetalol HCl occur within 2 to 4 hours. The duration of effect depends upon 
dose, lasting at least 8 hours following single oral doses of 100 mg and more than 12 hours following single oral doses of 300 mg. The maximum, steady-state blood pressure response upon oral, 
twice-a-day dosing occurs within 24 to 72 hours. The antihypertensive effect of labetalol has a linear correlation with the logarithm of labetalol plasma concentration, and there is also a linear 
correlation between the reduction in exercise-induced tachycardia occurring at 2 hours after oral administration of labetalol HCl and the logarithm of the plasma concentration. About 70% of the 
maximum beta-blocking effect is present for 5 hours after the administration of a single oral dose of 400 mg with suggestion that about 40% remains at 8 hours. LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: The 
antianginal efficacy of labetalol HCl has not been studied. In 37 patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease, labetalol HCl did not increase the incidence or severity of angina attacks. 
Exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias have been reported after abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-adrenergic blocking agents in 
patients with coronary artery disease. Abrupt withdrawal of these agents in patients without coronary artery disease has resulted in transient symptoms, including tremulousness, sweating, palpitation,
headache, and malaise. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these phenomena, among them increased sensitivity to catecholamines because of increased numbers of beta receptors. Although 
beta-adrenergic receptor blockade is useful in the treatment of angina and hypertension, there are also situations in which sympathetic stimulation is vital. LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: For 
example, in patients with severely damaged hearts, adequate ventricular function may depend on sympathetic drive. Beta-adrenergic blockade may worsen A-V block by preventing the necessary facilitating
effects of sympathetic activity on conduction. Beta 2 -adrenergic blockade results in passive bronchial constriction by interfering with endogenous adrenergic bronchodilator activity in patients 
subject to bronchospasm, and it may also interfere with exogenous bronchodilators in such patients. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: Labetalol HCl is completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal 
tract with peak plasma levels occurring 1 to 2 hours after oral administration. The relative bioavailability of labetalol HCl tablets compared to an oral solution is 100%. The absolute bioavailability
(fraction of drug reaching systemic circulation) of labetalol when compared to an IV infusion is 25%; this is due to extensive "first-pass" metabolism. LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: Despite 
"first-pass" metabolism, there is a linear relationship between oral doses of 100 to 3,000 mg and peak plasma levels. The absolute bioavailability of labetalol is increased when administered with 
food. The plasma half-life of labetalol following oral administration is about 6 to 8 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of labetalol during repetitive dosing are reached by about the third day of 
dosing. In patients with decreased hepatic or renal function, the elimination half-life of labetalol is not altered; however, the relative bioavailability in hepatically impaired patients is increased
due to decreased "first-pass" metabolism. The metabolism of labetalol is mainly through conjugation to glucuronide metabolites. These metabolites are present in plasma and are excreted in the urine 
and, via the bile, into the feces. LABETALOL: clinical_pharmacology: Approximately 55% to 60% of a dose appears in the urine as conjugates or unchanged labetalol within the first 24 hours of dosing. 
Labetalol has been shown to cross the placental barrier in humans. Only negligible amounts of the drug crossed the blood-brain barrier in animal studies. Labetalol is approximately 50% protein bound. 
Neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis removes a significant amount of labetalol HCl from the general circulation (<1%). Elderly Patients: Some pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the 
elimination of labetalol is reduced in elderly patients. Therefore, although elderly patients may initiate therapy at the currently recommended dosage of 100 mg b.i.d., elderly patients will generally
require lower maintenance dosages than nonelderly patients.         
SOURCE:LABETALOL label


CONTENT: LABETALOL: precautions: Drugs possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of beta-receptor agonist drugs in patients with bronchospasm; therefore, doses greater 
than the normal antiasthmatic dose of beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs may be required. Cimetidine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of labetalol HCl. Since this could be explained 
either by enhanced absorption or by an alteration of hepatic metabolism of labetalol HCl, special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients. 
Synergism has been shown between halothane anesthesia and intravenously administered labetalol HCl. LABETALOL: precautions: During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using labetalol HCl in association 
with halothane, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac 
output and an increase in central venous pressure. The anesthesiologist should be informed when a patient is receiving labetalol HCl. Labetalol HCl blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by 
nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effect. If labetalol HCl is used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional antihypertensive effects may occur. Care should be 
taken if labetalol is used concomitantly with calcium antagonists of the verapamil type. Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. 
LABETALOL: precautions: comitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a 
variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat 
allergic reaction. Drug & OR Laboratory Test Interactions The presence of labetalol metabolites in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary catecholamines, metanephrine, 
normetanephrine, and vanillylmandelic acid when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods. In screening patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma and being treated with labetalol HCl, a 
specific method, such as a high performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction (e.g. LABETALOL: precautions: J Chromatogr 385:241,1987) should be employed in determining levels 
of catecholamines. Labetalol HCl has also been reported to produce a false-positive test for amphetamine when screening urine for the presence of drugs using the commercially available assay methods 
Toxi-Lab A ® (thin-layer chromatographic assay) and Emit-d.a.u ® (radioenzymatic assay). When patients being treated with labetalol have a positive urine test for amphetamine using these techniques, 
confirmation should be made by using more specific methods, such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique. Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Long-term oral dosing 
studies with labetalol HCl for 18 months in mice and for 2 years in rats showed no evidence of carcinogenesis. LABETALOL: precautions: Studies with labetalol HCl using dominant lethal assays in rats 
and mice and exposing microorganisms according to modified Ames tests showed no evidence of mutagenesis. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C: Teratogenic studies were performed with 
labetalol in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to approximately six and four times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. No reproducible evidence of fetal malformations was 
observed. Increased fetal resorptions were seen in both species at doses approximating the MRHD. A teratology study performed with labetalol in rabbits at IV doses up to 1.7 times the MRHD revealed no
evidence of drug related harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Labetalol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus.
