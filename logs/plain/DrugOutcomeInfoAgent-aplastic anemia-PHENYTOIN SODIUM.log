        Below are some relevant extracts for your query:
        -----
        
CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication 
arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy 
should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal 
necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued
at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. 
PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  . Studies in 
patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using 
carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, 
including phenytoin. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an 
increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an
alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers  . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for 
appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as 
antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic 
Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking 
antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial
swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. 
Eosinophilia is often present. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note
that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated 
immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are 
contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity  . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), 
barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions 
to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of 
acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, 
elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute 
hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal,
have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without 
bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node 
hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate 
such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS . PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: In all cases 
of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity 
(Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain 
distal to the site of injection (described as “purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight 
tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have
occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous 
Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be
tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous 
irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN 
SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with 
hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin 
with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium 
Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes  . 
PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, 
including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic 
women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially 
life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented
with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been 
reported. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin 
sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar 
atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms 
persist, termination is recommended.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis  In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin 
was administered in the diet to mice (10, 25, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the 
highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. 
In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 90 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 
120 mg/kg/day) to rats. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose 
tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In 
studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid 
exchange assay in CHO cells. Fe rtility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is 
slower) in pediatric patients  . Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS  have been observed. 
Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular:
Severe cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Severe complications
are most commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients  . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure  , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the 
lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin  . These have
included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these 
conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease have 
been reported . Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), 
but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of 
glucose , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are 
usually dose-related. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, 
transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and 
asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or 
long-term phenytoin use  . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Sk in and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations 
sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of 
dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis  . 
There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin  . Sp ec 
ial Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie’s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred 
speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.
