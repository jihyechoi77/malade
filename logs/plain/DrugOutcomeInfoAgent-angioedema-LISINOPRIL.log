CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: warnings: WARNINGS General Lisinopril Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions: Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of 
eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets) may be subject to a variety of adverse 
reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported rarely in patients treated with angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. This may occur at any time during treatment. ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in non-Black 
patients. LISINOPRIL: warnings: In such cases lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and 
sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. Even in those instances where swelling of only the tongue is involved, without respiratory distress, patients may require prolonged observation
since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient. Very rarely, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema. Patients 
with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with a history of airway surgery. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or 
larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0. LISINOPRIL: warnings: 5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly 
provided (See ADVERSE REACTIONS . ) Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE-inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see also 
INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) 
therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema (see PRECAUTIONS ). Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. 
These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. LISINOPRIL: 
warnings: The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be 
included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment 
with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily 
withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure: Sudden and potentially life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in some
patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions 
must be initiated. LISINOPRIL: warnings: Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis 
membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. 
Hypotension and Related Effects Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in uncomplicated hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of lisinopril use in salt/volume-depleted persons such as 
those treated vigorously with diuretics or patients on dialysis. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Syncope has been reported in 0.8 percent of patients receiving lisinopril 
and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. In patients with hypertension receiving lisinopril alone, the incidence of syncope was 0.1 percent. LISINOPRIL: warnings: The overall incidence of syncope may be 
reduced by proper titration of the individual components. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions , ADVERSE REACTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) In patients with severe congestive heart failure, 
with or without associated renal insufficiency, excessive hypotension has been observed and may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or 
death. Because of the potential fall in blood pressure in these patients, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. Such patients should be followed closely for the first two 
weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril and/or diuretic is increased. Similar considerations apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease in whom an excessive fall 
in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident.

PRINZIDE, with an incidence higher in Black than in non-Black patients. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. If angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or 
larynx occurs, treatment with PRINZIDE should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately. In rare cases, intestinal angioedema has been reported with angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitors including lisinopril. (See WARNINGS ). Hypotension: In clinical trials, adverse effects relating to hypotension occurred as follows: hypotension (1.4 percent), orthostatic hypotension (0.5 
percent), other orthostatic effects (3.2 percent). In addition syncope occurred in 0.8 percent of patients (See WARNINGS ). LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Cough: See PRECAUTIONS - Cough . Clinical 
Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes: (See PRECAUTIONS ). Creatinine, Blood Urea Nitrogen: Minor reversible increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in patients with 
essential hypertension treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. More marked increases have also been reported and were more likely to occur in patients with renal artery stenosis (See 
PRECAUTIONS ). Serum Uric Acid, Glucose, Magnesium, Cholesterol, Triglycerides and Calcium: (See PRECAUTIONS ). Hemoglobin and Hematocrit: Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit (mean decreases 
of approximately 0.5 g% and 1.5 vol%, respectively) occurred frequently in hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets but were rarely of clinical importance unless 
another cause of anemia coexisted. LISINOPRIL: adverse_reactions: In clinical trials, 0.4% of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia. Liver Function Tests: Rarely, elevations of liver enzymes 
and/or serum bilirubin have occurred. (See WARNINGS, Hepatic Failure ). Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the individual components are listed below: Lisinopril - In clinical trials
adverse reactions which occurred with lisinopril were also seen with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline
in GFR, end state renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group. In general, avoid combined use of RAS 
inhibitors. Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with 
lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with PRINZIDE in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other Agents: Lisinopril has been used 
concomitantly with nitrates and/or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: No meaningful clinically important pharmacokinetic 
interactions occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol, digoxin, or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril. 
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, 
triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is 
indicated, because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving 
lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and
the ACE inhibitor. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial 
flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including lisinopril and
hydrochlorothiazide tablets. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors: Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) 
therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. (see WARNINGS ) Neprilysin Inhibitors: Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema. LISINOPRIL: 
drug_interactions: (see WARNINGS ) Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics - potentiation of 
orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) - dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other antihypertensive drugs - additive effect or 
potentiation. Cholestyramine and colestipol resins - Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol 
resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH - intensified electrolyte depletion, 
particularly hypokalemia. Pressor amines (e.g. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: norepinephrine) - possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal muscle 
relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) - possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium - should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal 
clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. 
Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatoryDrugs - In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, 
potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product and in 
patients with a history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and in patients with hereditary or idiopathic angioedema. Because of the 
hydrochlorothiazide component, this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide-derived drugs. Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are 
contraindicated in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor (e.g., sacubitril). Do not administer lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets within 36 hours of switching to or from 
sacubitril/valsartan, a neprilysin inhibitor (see WARNINGS ). LISINOPRIL: contraindications: Do not coadminister aliskiren with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes.   
SOURCE:LISINOPRIL label


CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled 
trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely 
responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular 
mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so 
that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across 
populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia),
and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black 
patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of 
therapy. These fixed-dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). LISINOPRIL: indications_and_usage: In using lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, 
consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular 
disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk. (See WARNINGS .) In considering use of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, it should be 
noted that Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-Black. (See WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema .

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Angioedema: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur at any time during treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitors, including lisinopril. Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, 
difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to take no more drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician. Symptomatic Hypotension: Patients should be cautioned to report 
lightheadedness especially during the first few days of therapy. If actual syncope occurs, the patients should be told to discontinue the drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician.
All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. LISINOPRIL: information_for_patients:
Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult with their physician. Hyperkalemia: Patients should be 
told not to use salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician. Neutropenia: Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever)
which may be a sign of neutropenia. Pregnancy: Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets during pregnancy. 
Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant. Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer: Instruct patients 
taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening.

LISINOPRIL increases the risk of angioedema. This has been confirmed by FDAHandler, who referenced the LISINOPRIL label indicating that angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, 
and/or larynx has been reported rarely in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including LISINOPRIL. The incidence of angioedema is higher in Black patients compared to 
non-Black patients, and in very rare cases, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to 
ACE-inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema has also been reported rarely in patients treated with ACE inhibitors.
