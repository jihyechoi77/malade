CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS & USAGE Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. The blood pressure lowering effects of 
captopril and thiazides are approximately additive. This fixed combination drug may be used as initial therapy or substituted for previously titrated doses of the individual components. When captopril
and hydrochlorothiazide are given together it may not be necessary to administer captopril in divided doses to attain blood pressure control at trough (before the next dose). Also, with such a 
combination, a daily dose of 15 mg of hydrochlorothiazide may be adequate. Treatment may, therefore, be initiated with captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 25 mg/15 mg once daily. CAPTOPRIL: 
indications_and_usage: Subsequent titration should be with additional doses of the components (captopril, hydrochlorothiazide) as single agents or as captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 50 mg/15
mg, 25 mg/25 mg, or 50 mg/25 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using captopril and hydrochlorothiazide, consideration should be given to the risk of neutropenia/agranulocytosis (see WARNINGS ). 
Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide may be used for patients with normal renal function, in whom the risk is relatively low. In patients with impaired renal function, particularly those with collagen 
vascular disease, captopril and hydrochlorothiazide should be reserved for hypertensives who have either developed unacceptable side effects on other drugs, or have failed to respond satisfactorily to
other drug combinations. CAPTOPRIL: indications_and_usage: ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: 
Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema ).         
SOURCE:CAPTOPRIL label


CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: warnings: WARNINGS Captopril : Anaphylactoid and Possible Related Reactions : Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and 
polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including captopril) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema 
: Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been seen in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including captopril. If angioedema involves the 
tongue, glottis or larynx, airway obstruction may occur and be fatal. Emergency therapy, including but not necessarily limited to, subcutaneous administration of a 1:1000 solution of epinephrine 
should be promptly instituted. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Swelling confined to the face, mucous membranes of the mouth, lips and extremities has usually resolved with discontinuation of treatment; some 
cases required medical therapy. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Captopril .) Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with 
ACE inhibitors. These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. 
The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in
the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization : Two patients undergoing desensitizing 
treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were 
temporarily withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure : Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with 
high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate 
absorption. Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis : Neutropenia (< 1000/mm 3 ) with myeloid hypoplasia has resulted from use of captopril. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: About half of the neutropenic patients developed 
systemic or oral cavity infections or other features of the syndrome of agranulocytosis. The risk of neutropenia is dependent on the clinical status of the patient: In clinical trials in patients with
hypertension who have normal renal function (serum creatinine less than 1.6 mg/dL and no collagen vascular disease), neutropenia has been seen in one patient out of over 8,600 exposed. In patients 
with some degree of renal failure (serum creatinine at least 1.6 mg/dL) but no collagen vascular disease, the risk of neutropenia in clinical trials was about 1 per 500, a frequency over 15 times that
for uncomplicated hypertension. Daily doses of captopril were relatively high in these patients, particularly in view of their diminished renal function. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: In foreign marketing 
experience in patients with renal failure, use of allopurinol concomitantly with captopril has been associated with neutropenia but this association has not appeared in U.S. reports. In patients with 
collagen vascular diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma) and impaired renal function, neutropenia occurred in 3.7 percent of patients in clinical trials. While none of the over 750
patients in formal clinical trials of heart failure developed neutropenia, it has occurred during the subsequent clinical experience. About half of the reported cases had serum creatinine ≥ 1.6 mg/dL 
and more than 75 percent were in patients also receiving procainamide. In heart failure, it appears that the same risk factors for neutropenia are present. The neutropenia has usually been detected 
within three months after captopril was started.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Captopril : Reported incidences are based on clinical trials involving approximately 7000 patients. Renal : About one of 100 patients developed
proteinuria (see WARNINGS ). Each of the following has been reported in approximately 1 to 2 of 1000 patients and are of uncertain relationship to drug use: renal insufficiency, renal failure, 
nephrotic syndrome, polyuria, oliguria, and urinary frequency. Hematologic : Neutropenia/agranulocytosis has occurred (see WARNINGS ). Cases of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been 
reported. Dermatologic : Rash, often with pruritus, and sometimes with fever, arthralgia, and eosinophilia, occurred in about 4 to 7 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients, usually 
during the first four weeks of therapy. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: It is usually maculopapular, and rarely urticarial. The rash is usually mild and disappears within a few days of dosage reduction,
short-term treatment with an antihistaminic agent, and/or discontinuing therapy; remission may occur even if captopril is continued. Pruritus, without rash, occurs in about 2 of 100 patients. Between 
7 and 10 percent of patients with skin rash have shown eosinophilia and/or positive ANA titers. A reversible associated pemphigoid-like lesion, and photosensitivity, have also been reported. Flushing 
or pallor has been reported in 2 to 5 of 1000 patients. Cardiovascular : Hypotension may occur; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (Drug Interactions) for discussion of hypotension with captopril therapy. 
Tachycardia, chest pain, and palpitations have each been observed in approximately 1 of 100 patients. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, Raynaud’s syndrome, and 
congestive heart failure have each occurred in 2 to 3 of 1000 patients. Dysgeusia : Approximately 2 to 4 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients developed a diminution or loss of taste 
perception. Taste impairment is reversible and usually self-limited (2 to 3 months) even with continued drug administration. Weight loss may be associated with the loss of taste. Angioedema : 
Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in approximately one in 1000 patients. Angioedema involving the upper airways has caused
fatal airway obstruction. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Cough : Cough has been
reported in 0.5 to 2% of patients treated with captopril in clinical trials (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Captopril: Cough ). The following have been reported in about 0.5 to 2 percent of patients but 
did not appear at increased frequency compared to placebo or other treatments used in controlled trials: gastric irritation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, 
aphthous ulcers, peptic ulcer, dizziness, headache, malaise, fatigue, insomnia, dry mouth, dyspnea, alopecia, paresthesias. Other clinical adverse effects reported since the drug was marketed are 
listed below by body system. In this setting, an incidence or causal relationship cannot be accurately determined. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Body as a Whole : Anaphylactoid reactions (see 
WARNINGS: Captopril: Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). General : asthenia, gynecomastia. Cardiovascular : cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular 
accident/insufficiency, rhythm disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, syncope. Dermatologic : bullous pemphigus, erythema multiforme (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), exfoliative dermatitis. 
Gastrointestinal : pancreatitis, glossitis, dyspepsia. Hematologic : anemia, including aplastic and hemolytic. Hepatobiliary : jaundice, hepatitis, including rare cases of necrosis, cholestasis. 
Metabolic : symptomatic hyponatremia. Musculoskeletal : myalgia, myasthenia.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: information_for_patients: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling 
of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal 
Angioedema .) Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which may be a sign of neutropenia, or of progressive edema which might be related to 
proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. 
Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult with the physician. CAPTOPRIL: information_for_patients: 
Patients should be advised not to use potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes without consulting their physician. (See PRECAUTIONS: General and Drug
Interactions: Captopril ; ADVERSE REACTIONS: Captopril .) Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of medication unless instructed by the physician. Heart failure patients on 
captopril therapy should be cautioned against rapid increases in physical activity. Patients should be informed that captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken one hour before meals 
(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).
