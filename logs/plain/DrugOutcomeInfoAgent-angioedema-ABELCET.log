CONTENT: ABELCET: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate patients), 
of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 patients were 
treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with ABELCET ® , 9% 
discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient chills and/or fever 
during infusion of the drug. ABELCET: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14 Increased Serum Creatinine 11

CONTENT: ABELCET: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics The assay used to measure amphotericin B in the blood after the administration of ABELCET ® does not distinguish 
amphotericin B that is complexed with the phospholipids of ABELCET ® from amphotericin B that is uncomplexed. The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B after the administration of ABELCET ® are 
nonlinear. Volume of distribution and clearance from blood increase with increasing dose of ABELCET ® , resulting in less than proportional increases in blood concentrations of amphotericin B over a 
dose range of 0.6-5 mg/kg/day. ABELCET: clinical_pharmacology: The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B in whole blood after the administration of ABELCET ® and amphotericin B desoxycholate are:

ANSWER: ABELCET does not specifically list angioedema as a known adverse reaction. However, it does mention anaphylactoid and other allergic reactions without specifying the frequency. Anaphylaxis has
been reported with ABELCET with an incidence rate of <0.1%. Since angioedema can be part of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, it is possible that ABELCET could be associated with angioedema, but 
the available information does not quantify this risk.

        Question: Does ABELCET increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.
2. FDAHandler responded that ABELCET does not specifically list angioedema as a known adverse reaction. However, it does mention anaphylactoid and other allergic reactions without specifying the 
frequency. Anaphylaxis, which can include symptoms such as angioedema, has been reported with ABELCET with an incidence rate of <0.1%.

        Final answer: ABELCET could potentially be associated with angioedema as part of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, but the available information does not quantify this risk beyond stating 
that anaphylaxis has been reported with an incidence rate of <0.1%. Therefore, while angioedema could occur, the degree of risk is not clearly defined.
