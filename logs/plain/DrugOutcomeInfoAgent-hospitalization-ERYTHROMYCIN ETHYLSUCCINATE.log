CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: In one cohort of 157 newborns who were given erythromycin for pertussis prophylaxis, seven neonates (5%) developed symptoms of non-bilious 
vomiting or irritability with feeding and were subsequently diagnosed as having IHPS requiring surgical pyloromyotomy . A possible dose-response effect was described with an absolute risk of IHPS of 
5.1% for infants who took erythromycin for 8-14 days and 10% for infants who took erythromycin for 15-21 days. 2 Since erythromycin may be used in the treatment of conditions in infants which are 
associated with significant mortality or morbidity (such as pertussis or neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis infections), the benefit of erythromycin therapy needs to be weighed against the potential risk 
of developing IHPS. Parents should be informed to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: Prolonged or repeated use of 
erythromycin may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria or fungi. If superinfection occurs, erythromycin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. When indicated, incision
and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Observational studies in humans have reported cardiovascular malformations after exposure to drug 
products containing erythromycin during early pregnancy. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ery-Ped should only be used to treat bacterial 
infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Ery-Ped is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better 
early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) 
decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ery-Ped or other antibacterial drugs in the 
future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and 
bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician 
as soon as possible. Drug Interactions Theophylline Erythromycin use in patients who are receiving high doses of theophylline may be associated with an increase in serum theophylline levels and 
potential theophylline toxicity. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of theophylline should be reduced while 
the patient is receiving concomitant erythromycin therapy. There have been published reports suggesting that when oral erythromycin is given concurrently with theophylline there is a decrease in 
erythromycin serum concentrations of approximately 35%. The mechanism by which this interaction occurs is unknown. The decrease in erythromycin concentrations due to co-administration of theophylline 
could result in subtherapeutic concentrations of erythromycin. Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent verapamil, belonging to the 
calcium channel blockers drug class. Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: 
There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly. Increased anticoagulation effects due to interactions of erythromycin with
various oral anticoagulants may be more pronounced in the elderly. Erythromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of the 3A isoform subfamily of the cytochrome p450 enzyme system (CYP3A). Coadministration 
of erythromycin and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects of the 
concomitant drug. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving 
erythromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A 
isoform are also possible. The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products in post-marketing experience: Ergotamine/dihydroergotamine Post-marketing reports 
indicate that co-administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other 
tissues including the central nervous system. Concomitant administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: 
precautions: Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as triazolam and alprazolam) and Related Benzodiazepines Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may 
increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Erythromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., lovastatin and
simvastatin). Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Sildenafil (Viagra) Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC)
of sildenafil. Reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A 
based interactions of erythromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, vinblastine, and bromocriptine. 
Concomitant administration of erythromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, there have been reports of interactions of 
erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: Erythromycin has been reported to 
significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including 
electrocardiographic QT/QT c interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other ventricular arrhythmias have been observed. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, deaths have been 
reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin. There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin was co-administered with cisapride, 
resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes most likely due to the inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by 
erythromycin. Fatalities have been reported.

ANSWER: The available information from the ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE label does not specifically address the risk of hospitalization. However, it does mention precautions and potential adverse 
effects associated with the drug, such as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) requiring surgical intervention in newborns given erythromycin for pertussis prophylaxis, and the risk of 
developing superinfection with prolonged or repeated use. Additionally, there are precautions regarding drug interactions that could potentially lead to serious conditions if not managed properly. The
label emphasizes that the benefits of erythromycin therapy need to be weighed against the potential risks.

specifically address the risk of hospitalization. However, it does mention certain precautions and potential adverse effects associated with the drug. For example, it notes that infantile hypertrophic
pyloric stenosis (IHPS), which requires surgical intervention, has been reported in newborns given erythromycin for pertussis prophylaxis. Additionally, there is a risk of developing superinfection 
with prolonged or repeated use of erythromycin. The label also includes precautions regarding drug interactions that could potentially lead to serious conditions if not managed properly. It is 
emphasized that the benefits of erythromycin therapy need to be weighed against the potential risks.

Given this information, while the label does not directly state that ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization, the potential for serious adverse effects and the 
need for surgical intervention in certain cases (such as IHPS in newborns) suggest that there could be scenarios where the use of this drug might lead to hospitalization. However, this is not 
explicitly stated as a general risk of hospitalization due to the drug itself.

Based on the information provided by the FDA label, I cannot definitively say whether ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization overall. The degree of risk for 
hospitalization would depend on the individual patient's response to the drug, the presence of any complicating factors, and the management of any adverse effects that may arise.

The FDA label for ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE does not specifically address the risk of hospitalization. While it does mention precautions and potential adverse effects that could lead to serious 
conditions if not managed properly, such as infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) requiring surgical intervention in newborns and the risk of developing superinfection with prolonged or 
repeated use, there is no direct statement about the overall risk of hospitalization due to the drug. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively say whether ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increases or
decreases the risk of hospitalization. The degree of risk would depend on individual patient factors and the management of any adverse effects that may arise.
