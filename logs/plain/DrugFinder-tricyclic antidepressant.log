        Question: Which three drugs from the provided list are the most common tricyclic antidepressants, based on the usage rates from the medical database query?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. From the provided list, identify the generic names of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).
2. Match these generic names with the usage rates from the medical database query.
3. Select the three drugs with the highest usage rates, ensuring they are distinct active ingredients and not derivatives or brand names of the same drug.
4. The drugs with the highest usage rates are 'Doxepin HCl', 'Desipramine', and 'Amitriptyline HCl'.
5. Ensure that the selected drugs are listed exactly as they appear in the original list provided.
        -----
        Final answer: 'DOXEPIN HCL', 'DESIPRAMINE', 'AMITRIPTYLINE HCL'

'DOXEPIN HCL' and 'AMITRIPTYLINE HCL' due to the presence of 'HCl' (hydrochloride) in their names. The concern is whether these names represent the basic form of the drug or if they should be referred
to without the 'HCl'. 

Upon reviewing the original list provided, it is clear that both 'DOXEPIN HCL' and 'AMITRIPTYLINE HCL' are listed as separate entries from 'DOXEPIN' and 'AMITRIPTYLINE'. Therefore, the inclusion of 
'HCl' is appropriate because it matches the exact names from the original list, and these are the names associated with the usage rates from the medical database query.

The requirement is to match the names exactly as they appear in the original list, and since 'DOXEPIN HCL' and 'AMITRIPTYLINE HCL' are listed separately from their non-hydrochloride counterparts, they
should be included with 'HCl' in the final answer. Thus, the original answer remains correct, and no changes are necessary.
