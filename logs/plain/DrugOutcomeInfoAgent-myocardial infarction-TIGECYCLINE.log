CONTENT: DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with 
antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this 
occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests In venereal diseases when coexistent syphilis is suspected, darkfield examination should be done before treatment 
is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least 4 months. In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic, should be 
performed. All patients with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis. Patients treated with demeclocycline HCl should have a follow-up serologic test for syphilis 
after 3 months. DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may 
require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillins, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class 
drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. The concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has
been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and by iron-containing preparations. Carcinogenesis, 
Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of demeclocycline HCl have not been conducted. DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: However, 
there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the related antibiotics oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors) and minocycline (thyroid tumors). Although mutagenicity 
studies of demeclocycline HCl have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related 
antibiotics (tetracyclines HCl and oxytetracycline) (see WARNINGS and ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY ). Demeclocycline HCl had no effect on fertility when administered in the diet to male 
and female rats at a daily intake of 45 times the human dose. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS ). DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: Result of animal studies 
indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of 
embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Nonteratogenic effects (See WARNINGS ) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing 
Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue 
nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Not for use in patients younger than eight years of age .

has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be 
avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri. (See PRECAUTIONS . MINOCIN: drug_interactions: ) Increased risk of

rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, 2514
patients were treated with tigecycline for injection. Tigecycline for injection was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of patients compared to 6% for all comparators. Table 1 shows the 
incidence of adverse reactions through test of cure reported in ≥2% of patients in these trials. Table 1. TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions Through Test of Cure

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Metoprolol tartrate is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocker. This 
preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta 2 -adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature. Clinical
pharmacology studies have demonstrated the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood 
pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia. Hypertension The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of 
beta-blocking agents has not been fully elucidated. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: clinical_pharmacology: However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at
peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin
activity. Angina Pectoris By blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, in velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, metoprolol reduces the oxygen requirements
of the heart at any given level of effort, thus making it useful in the long-term management of angina pectoris. Myocardial Infarction The precise mechanism of action of metoprolol in patients with 
suspected or definite myocardial infarction is not known. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: clinical_pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics Relative beta 1 selectivity is demonstrated by the following: (1) In healthy 
subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta 2 -mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective (beta 1 plus beta 2 ) beta-blockers, which completely
reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV 1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta 1 
-receptor blocking doses. Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at doses much greater than required for beta-blockade. Animal and 
human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: clinical_pharmacology: Significant beta-blocking effect (as measured by 
reduction of exercise heart rate) occurs within 1 hour after oral administration, and its duration is dose-related. For example, a 50% reduction of the maximum effect after single oral doses of 20, 
50, and 100 mg occurred at 3.3, 5, and 6.4 hours, respectively, in normal subjects. After repeated oral dosages of 100 mg twice daily, a significant reduction in exercise systolic blood pressure was 
evident at 12 hours. When the drug was infused over a 10-minute period, in normal volunteers, maximum beta-blockade was achieved at approximately 20 minutes. Equivalent maximal beta-blocking effect is
achieved with oral and intravenous doses in the ratio of approximately 2.5:1. There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and reduction of exercise heart rate. However, 
antihypertensive activity does not appear to be related to plasma levels.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE Acute Toxicity Several cases of overdosage have been reported, some leading to death. Oral LD 50 ’s (mg/kg): mice, 1158 to 2460; rats, 3090 to 
4670. Signs and Symptoms Potential signs and symptoms associated with overdosage with metoprolol are bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure and death. 
Management There is no specific antidote. In general, patients with acute or recent myocardial infarction may be more hemodynamically unstable than other patients and should be treated accordingly 
(see WARNINGS, Myocardial Infarction ). On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, the following general measures should be employed: Elimination of the Drug: Gastric lavage should be 
performed. Other clinical manifestations of overdose should be managed symptomatically based on modern methods of intensive care. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: overdosage: Hypotension: Administer a 
vasopressor, e.g., levarterenol or dopamine. Bronchospasm: Administer a beta 2 -stimulating agent and/or a theophylline derivative. Cardiac Failure: Administer digitalis glycoside and diuretic. In 
shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider administration of dobutamine, isoproterenol or glucagon.

Prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or cardiac valve replacement. Reduction in the risk of death, recurrent myocardial infarction 
(MI), and thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization after myocardial infarction. Limitations of Use Warfarin sodium tablets have no direct effect on an established thrombus, nor 
does it reverse ischemic tissue damage. Once a thrombus has occurred, however, the goals of anticoagulant treatment are to prevent further extension of the formed clot and to prevent secondary 
thromboembolic complications that may result in serious and possibly fatal sequelae. WARFARIN: indications_and_usage: Warfarin sodium tablets are a vitamin K antagonist indicated for: Prophylaxis and
