                Passages:
                1. Drug METOPROLOL TARTRATE: METOPROLOL TARTRATE decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. This conclusion is based on a large clinical study cited by the FDA, which
showed that metoprolol reduced 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction. Patients in the study received metoprolol both very early (intravenously) and 
during a subsequent 3-month period, while the placebo group did not receive any beta-blocker treatment during this time.
2. Drug LABETALOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for LABETALOL does not contain information regarding its effect on mortality risk after a myocardial infarction. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this data whether 
LABETALOL increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
3. Drug ATENOLOL: ATENOLOL decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which states that Atenolol is indicated for the 
management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality. The International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-1), which 
included over 16,000 patients, used atenolol to treat patients with acute myocardial infarction, suggesting a benefit in reducing cardiovascular mortality.

        Question: Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that METOPROLOL TARTRATE decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, based on a large clinical study showing a 36% reduction in 3-month mortality.
2. Passage 2 does not provide information on LABETALOL's effect on mortality risk after myocardial infarction.
3. Passage 3 states that ATENOLOL decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, with evidence from the International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-1) suggesting a benefit in reducing 
cardiovascular mortality.
4. Given that two of the beta blockers (METOPROLOL TARTRATE and ATENOLOL) have strong evidence supporting a decrease in mortality risk after myocardial infarction, and one beta blocker (LABETALOL) has
no information available, the overall effect of the beta blocker category can be inferred to decrease the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
        -----
        Final answer: The beta blocker category of drugs decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
