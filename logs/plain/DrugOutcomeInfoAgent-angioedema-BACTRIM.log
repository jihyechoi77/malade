CONTENT: BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of BACTRIM or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were identified in clinical trials, 
postmarketing or published reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or 
establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and 
urticaria). BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Fatalities and serious adverse reactions, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; 
agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
products, including BACTRIM(see WARNINGS ). BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic 
anemia, hypoprothrombinemia, methemoglobinemia, eosinophilia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Allergic Reactions: Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, anaphylaxis, allergic myocarditis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, drug fever, chills, Henoch-Schoenlein purpura, serum sickness-like 
syndrome, generalized allergic reactions, generalized skin eruptions, photosensitivity, conjunctival and scleral injection, pruritus, urticaria, rash, periarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP), and acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND) (see WARNINGS ). 
BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Gastrointestinal: Hepatitis (including cholestatic jaundice and hepatic necrosis), elevation of serum transaminase and bilirubin, pseudomembranous enterocolitis, 
pancreatitis, stomatitis, glossitis, nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia. Genitourinary: Renal failure, interstitial nephritis, BUN and serum creatinine elevation, renal insufficiency, 
oliguria and anuria, crystalluria and nephrotoxicity in association with cyclosporine. Metabolic and Nutritional: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia (see PRECAUTIONS: Electrolyte Abnormalities ), metabolic 
acidosis. Neurologic: Aseptic meningitis, convulsions, peripheral neuritis, ataxia, vertigo, tinnitus, headache. Psychiatric: Hallucinations, depression, apathy, nervousness. BACTRIM: 
adverse_reactions: Endocrine: The sulfonamides bear certain chemical similarities to some goitrogens, diuretics (acetazolamide and the thiazides) and oral hypoglycemic agents. Cross-sensitivity may 
exist with these agents. Diuresis and hypoglycemia have occurred. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory: Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates, acute 
eosinophilic pneumonia, acute and delayed lung injury, interstitial lung disease, acute respiratory failure (see WARNINGS ). Cardiovascular System: QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia
and torsades de pointes , circulatory shock (see WARNINGS ) . Miscellaneous: Weakness, fatigue, insomnia.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: warnings: WARNINGS Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions Fatalities and serious adverse reactions including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous 
pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the 
administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates potentially representing hypersensitivity
reactions of the respiratory tract have been reported in association with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment. BACTRIM: warnings: Other severe pulmonary adverse reactions occurring within days
to week of BACTRIM initiation and resulting in prolonged respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), lung transplantation or death have also 
been reported in patients and otherwise healthy individuals treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products. Circulatory shock with fever, severe hypotension, and confusion requiring 
intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors has occurred within minutes to hours of re-challenge with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM, in patients with history of 
recent (days to weeks) exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. BACTRIM should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of a serious adverse reaction. BACTRIM: warnings: 
A skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, AFND, AGEP, hepatic necrosis, or serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS 
and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Clinical signs, such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions. 
Thrombocytopenia BACTRIM-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually 
resolves within a week upon discontinuation of BACTRIM. BACTRIM: warnings: Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group A Î²-hemolytic 
streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever. Clostridioides difficile Associated 
Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including BACTRIM, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal 
colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of 
CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. BACTRIM: warnings:
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the 
administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte 
management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk Associated with Concurrent Use of Leucovorin for 
Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia Treatment failure and excess mortality were observed when BACTRIM was used concomitantly with leucovorin for the treatment of HIV positive patients with P. jirovecii 
pneumonia in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. 4 Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM and leucovorin during treatment of P . jirovecii pneumonia.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: pregnancy: Pregnancy While there are no large, well-controlled studies on the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in pregnant women, Brumfitt and Pursell, 11 in a retrospective 
study, reported the outcome of 186 pregnancies during which the mother received either placebo or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. The incidence of congenital abnormalities was 4.5% (3 of 66) in 
those who received placebo and 3.3% (4 of 120) in those receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. There were no abnormalities in the 10 children whose mothers received the drug during the first 
trimester. In a separate survey, Brumfitt and Pursell also found no congenital abnormalities in 35 children whose mothers had received oral sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim at the time of conception 
or shortly thereafter. BACTRIM: pregnancy: Because sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may interfere with folic acid metabolism, BACTRIM should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Cyclosporine Avoid concurrent use There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration of BACTRIM and cyclosporine in renal 
transplant recipients. Digoxin Monitor serum digoxin levels Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Indomethacin Avoid concurrent use
Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin. Pyrimethamine Avoid concurrent use Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine 
as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if BACTRIM is prescribed. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) Monitor therapeutic response and adjust dose of TCA 
accordingly The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when coadministered with BACTRIM. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Oral Hypoglycemics Monitor blood glucose more frequently Like other 
sulfonamide-containing drugs, BACTRIM potentiates the effect of oral hypoglycemic that are metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone) or CYP2C9 (e.g., glipizide and 
glyburide) or eliminated renally via OCT2 (e.g., metformin). Additional monitoring of blood glucose may be warranted. Amantadine Avoid concurrent use In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium
has been reported after concomitant intake of BACTRIM and amantadine (an OCT2 substrate). Cases of interactions with other OCT2 substrates, memantine and metformin, have also been reported. BACTRIM: 
drug_interactions: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Avoid concurrent use In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been reported after concomitant intake of 
BACTRIM and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. 5,6 Zidovudine Monitor for hematologic toxicity Zidovudine and BACTRIM are known to induce hematological abnormalities. Hence, there is 
potential for an additive myelotoxicity when coadministered. 7 Dofetilide Concurrent administration is contraindicated Elevated plasma concentrations of dofetilide have been reported following 
concurrent administration of trimethoprim and dofetilide. Increased plasma concentrations of dofetilide may cause serious ventricular arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation, including 
torsade de pointes . BACTRIM: drug_interactions: 8,9 Procainamide Closely monitor for clinical and ECG signs of procainamide toxicity and/or procainamide plasma concentration if available Trimethoprim
increases the plasma concentrations of procainamide and its active N-acetyl metabolite (NAPA) when trimethoprim and procainamide are coadministered. The increased procainamide and NAPA plasma 
concentrations that resulted from the pharmacokinetic interaction with trimethoprim are associated with further prolongation of the QTc interval.
