CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 3%) are abdominal pain, acid regurgitation, constipation, diarrhea, 
dyspepsia, musculoskeletal pain, and nausea. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Radius Health, Inc. at 1-855-672-3487 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical 
Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the 
clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: The safety of BINOSTO (alendronate sodium) effervescent tablet 70 mg is 
based on clinical trial data of alendronate sodium 10 mg daily and alendronate sodium 70 mg weekly. Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Daily Dosing The safety of alendronate sodium 10 
mg daily in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was assessed in four clinical trials that enrolled 7453 women aged 44-84 years. Study 1 and Study 2 were identically designed, three-year, 
placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter studies (United States and Multinational n=994); Study 3 was the three year vertebral fracture cohort of the Fracture Intervention Trial [FIT] (n=2027) 
and Study 4 was the four-year clinical fracture cohort of FIT (n=4432). ALENDRONATE: adverse_reactions: Overall, 3620 patients were exposed to placebo and 3432 patients exposed to alendronate. 
Patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were included in these clinical trials. In Study 1 and Study 2 all women received 500 
mg elemental calcium as carbonate. In Study 3 and Study 4 all women with dietary calcium intake less than 1000 mg per day received 500 mg calcium and 250 IU Vitamin D per day. Among patients treated 
with alendronate 10 mg or placebo in Study 1 and Study 2, and all patients in Study 3 and Study 4, the incidence of all-cause mortality was 1.8% in the placebo group and 1.8% in the alendronate group.
The incidence of serious adverse events was 30.7% in the placebo group and 30.9% in the alendronate group.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: indications_and_usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BINOSTO is a bisphosphonate indicated for: Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women ( 1.1 ) Treatment to increase bone 
mass in men with osteoporosis ( 1.2 ) Limitation of use: Optimal duration of use has not been determined. For patients at low-risk for fracture, consider drug discontinuation after 3 to 5 years of use
( 1.3 ) 1.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women BINOSTO effervescent tablet 70 mg is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. For the treatment of 
osteoporosis, alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine (vertebral compression fractures). [See Clinical Studies (14.1) .] 1. 
ALENDRONATE: indications_and_usage: 2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis BINOSTO is indicated for treatment to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis  . 1.3 Important 
Limitations of Use The optimal duration of use has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of BINOSTO for the treatment of osteoporosis are based on clinical data of four years duration. All
patients on bisphosphonate therapy should have the need for continued therapy re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Patients at low-risk for fracture should be considered for drug discontinuation after 3 
to 5 years of use. Patients who discontinue therapy should have their risk for fracture re-evaluated periodically.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: mechanism_of_action: 12.1 Mechanism of Action Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate shows preferential localization to 
sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of active resorption. Alendronate does not 
interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [ 3 H]alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher 
uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [ 3 H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top
of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. ALENDRONATE: mechanism_of_action: Thus, alendronate must 
be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number
of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.

bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. ALENDRONATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of
low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females 
but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and 
lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90, the risk of hip fracture in 
white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold.

ALENDRONATE increases the risk of angioedema. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which cited the ALENDRONATE label indicating that hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria 
and angioedema have been reported.
