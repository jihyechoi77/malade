CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including CNS effects and respiratory depression, are dose dependent, with more severe effects 
occurring with high doses. In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), 
and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. LORAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, 
drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, 
convulsions/seizures, tremor, vertigo, eye function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, 
coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, 
increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, 
alopecia; syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic LORAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: hormone (SIADH), hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic 
manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases
in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS,

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to psychiatric medications, including lorazepam, 
during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at 
https://womensmentalhealth.org/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal 
withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do 
not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All 
pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage 
in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory 
depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor 
neonates exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome ). Data Human Data Published data 
from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: Although early studies 
reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort 
studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings. Animal Data Reproductive 
studies in animals were performed in mice, rats, and two strains of rabbits. Occasional anomalies (reduction of tarsals, tibia, metatarsals, malrotated limbs, gastroschisis, malformed skull, and 
microphthalmia) were seen in drug-treated rabbits without relationship to dosage. Although all of these anomalies were not present in the concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur 
randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg and higher, there was evidence of fetal resorption and increased fetal loss in rabbits which was not seen at lower doses. LORAZEPAM: precautions: 
Nursing Mothers Risk Summary Lorazepam is present in breast milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. The 
effects of lorazepam on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the motherâ€™s clinical need for lorazepam and any potential 
adverse effects on the breastfed infant from lorazepam or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to lorazepam through breast milk should be monitored for 
sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of lorazepam generally were not adequate to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently than younger 
subjects; however, the incidence of sedation and unsteadiness was observed to increase with age (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Age does not appear to have a significant effect on lorazepam kinetics (see 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). LORAZEPAM: precautions: Clinical circumstances, some of which may be more common in the elderly, such as hepatic or renal impairment, should be considered. Greater sensitivity
(e.g., sedation) of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, and lower doses may be sufficient in these patients (see DOSAGE 
AND ADMINISTRATION ).

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Lorazepam tablets are administered orally. For optimal results, dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy 
should be individualized according to patient response. To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available. The usual range is 2 to 6 mg/day given in divided doses, the largest dose 
being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg/day. For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg/day given two times a day or three times a day. For 
insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime. For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg/day in 
divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated. LORAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: The dosage of lorazepam tablets should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid 
adverse effects. When higher dosage is indicated, the evening dose should be increased before the daytime doses. Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Lorazepam Tablets To reduce the risk of 
withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue lorazepam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the 
previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ).

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether LORAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.
2. FDAHandler responded that the available information from the LORAZEPAM label does not indicate that lorazepam increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. The adverse reactions listed 
for lorazepam include various CNS effects, respiratory depression, and other effects such as dizziness, weakness, and unsteadiness, but myocardial infarction is not mentioned as a known adverse

The available information from the LORAZEPAM label does not indicate that lorazepam increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. The adverse reactions listed for lorazepam include various
CNS effects, respiratory depression, and other effects such as dizziness, weakness, and unsteadiness, but myocardial infarction is not mentioned as a known adverse reaction. Therefore, we cannot 
determine from the FDA label whether lorazepam has any effect on the risk of myocardial infarction.
