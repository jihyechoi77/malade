CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category B. A reproductive study has been performed in rabbits at doses up to three to ten times the concentration of silver
sulfadiazine in silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% and has revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to silver sulfadiazine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant 
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly justified, especially in pregnant women approaching or
at term. SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: (See CONTRAINDICATIONS )

CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Several cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in patients receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy. 1,2,3 Leukopenia associated with
silver sulfadiazine administration is primarily characterized by decreased neutrophil count. Maximal white blood cell depression occurs within two to four days of initiation of therapy. Rebound to 
normal leukocyte levels follows onset within two to three days. Recovery is not influenced by continuation of silver sulfadiazine therapy. An increased incidence has been seen in patients treated 
concurrently with cimetidine. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiforme, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial nephritis. Reduction in 
bacterial growth after application of topical antibacterial agents has been reported to permit spontaneous healing of deep partial-thickness burns by preventing conversion of the partial thickness to 
full thickness by sepsis. SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: However, reduction in bacterial colonization has caused delayed separation, in some cases necessitating escharotomy in order to prevent 
contracture.

CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prompt institution of appropriate regimens for care of the burned patient is of prime importance and includes the control of
shock and pain. The burn wounds are then cleansed and debrided; silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is then applied under sterile conditions. The burn areas should be covered with silver sulfadiazine 
cream, USP 1% at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of approximately one sixteenth of an inch. Whenever necessary, the cream should be reapplied to any areas 
from which it has been removed by patient activity. Administration may be accomplished in minimal time because dressings are not required. However, if individual patient requirements make dressings 
necessary, they may be used. Reapply immediately after hydrotherapy. Treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should be continued until satisfactory healing has occurred or until the burn site
is ready for grafting. SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: The drug should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except if a significant 
adverse reaction occurs.

Therefore, my answer must be DO-NOT-KNOW until I receive the necessary information from FDAHandler. If FDAHandler cannot answer the question, then the FDA label data does not specify the answer, and 
my response will remain DO-NOT-KNOW.

        Do one of the following:

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.
            DO NOT REPEAT your original message; ONLY specify the 
            `intended_recipient` via this tool/function-call.
        2. If you are ready to have the critic check your answer,
            do so with the `final_answer` tool/function, as I have requested.
        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
        else to say, you MUST EXIT IMMEDIATELY by stating that you are done
        with the usual code (as in #3).

My final answer is DO-NOT-KNOW because I have not received specific data from the FDA label regarding the relationship between SULFADIAZINE and the risk of myocardial infarction. Without this 
information, I cannot provide a reliable answer to whether SULFADIAZINE increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.
