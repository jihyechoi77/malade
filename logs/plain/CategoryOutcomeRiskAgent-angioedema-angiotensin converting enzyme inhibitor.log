                Passages:
                1. Drug LISINOPRIL: LISINOPRIL increases the risk of angioedema. This has been confirmed by FDAHandler, who referenced the LISINOPRIL label indicating that angioedema of the face, 
extremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and/or larynx has been reported rarely in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including LISINOPRIL. The incidence of angioedema is 
higher in Black patients compared to non-Black patients, and in very rare cases, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema. Patients with a 
history of angioedema unrelated to ACE-inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema has also been reported rarely in patients 
treated with ACE inhibitors.
2. Drug CAPTOPRIL: CAPTOPRIL increases the risk of angioedema. This has been reported in approximately one in 1000 patients, and can involve various parts of the body including extremities, face, 
lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or larynx. Fatal airway obstruction has occurred in some cases, and the risk is higher in black patients compared to non-black patients.
3. Drug ENALAPRIL MALEATE: The final answer to the question "Does ENALAPRIL MALEATE increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?" is that ENALAPRIL MALEATE increases the risk of angioedema. This 
information is based on the response from FDAHandler, which referenced the ENALAPRIL MALEATE label indicating that angioedema has been reported in patients receiving the drug. The incidence is higher 
in black patients compared to non-black patients, and angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If angioedema occurs, treatment with ENALAPRIL MALEATE should be discontinued and 
appropriate therapy instituted immediately.

        Question: Does the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs increase the risk of angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. All three passages provided indicate that the respective angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (LISINOPRIL, CAPTOPRIL, and ENALAPRIL MALEATE) increase the risk of angioedema.
2. Passage 1 states that LISINOPRIL increases the risk of angioedema, with rare reports of angioedema in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including LISINOPRIL.
3. Passage 2 indicates that CAPTOPRIL increases the risk of angioedema, with an incidence reported in approximately one in 1000 patients.
