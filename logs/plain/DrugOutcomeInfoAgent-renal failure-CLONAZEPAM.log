CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Seizure Disorders: Clonazepam tablets are useful alone or as an adjunct in the treatment of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (petit mal 
variant), akinetic, and myoclonic seizures. In patients with absence seizures (petit mal) who have failed to respond to succinimides, clonazepam tablets may be useful. Some loss of effect may occur 
during the course of clonazepam treatment (see PRECAUTIONS: Loss of Effect ). Panic Disorder: Clonazepam tablets are indicated for the treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, as 
defined in DSM-V. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of 
the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks. CLONAZEPAM: indications_and_usage: The efficacy of clonazepam tablets was established in two 6- to 9-week trials in panic 
disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-IIIR category of panic disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Trials ). Panic disorder (DSM-V) is characterized by recurrent unexpected
panic attacks, i.e. CLONAZEPAM: indications_and_usage: a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 
minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain
or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) 
fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes. CLONAZEPAM: indications_and_usage: The effectiveness of clonazepam tablets 
in long-term use, that is, for more than 9 weeks, has not been systematically studied in controlled clinical trials. The physician who elects to use clonazepam tablets for extended periods should 
periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).         
SOURCE:CLONAZEPAM label


CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: pediatric_use: Pediatric Use: Because of the possibility that adverse effects on physical or mental development could become apparent only after many years, a benefit-risk 
consideration of the long-term use of clonazepam tablets is important in pediatric patients being treated for seizure disorder (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Safety and 
effectiveness in pediatric patients with panic disorder below the age of 18 have not been established.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage 
and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. Effect of Clonazepam on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs: 
Clonazepam does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine or phenobarbital. Clonazepam has the potential to influence concentrations of phenytoin. Monitoring of phenytoin concentration
is recommended when clonazepam is co-administrated with phenytoin. The effect of clonazepam on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated. Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of
Clonazepam: Literature reports suggest that ranitidine, an agent that decreases stomach acidity, does not greatly alter clonazepam pharmacokinetics. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: In a study in which the 2 
mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam
was 10% lower and the C max of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone. The selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of 
clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in 
plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, 
notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated 
concentrations and effects. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Pharmacodynamic Interactions: The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, 
barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the tricyclic 
antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with clonazepam. Mutagenesis 
The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Impairment of Fertility In a two-generation fertility study in which 
clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning. The lowest dose tested is 
approximately 5 and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a body surface area (mg/m 2 ) basis. 
Pregnancy: Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as clonazepam tablets, during pregnancy. Healthcare 
providers are encouraged to recommend that pregnant women taking clonazepam tablets enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or online at http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ .

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: abuse: Abuse: Clonazepam tablets are a benzodiazepine and a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even 
once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care 
provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in 
controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical 
dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction. CLONAZEPAM: abuse: 
Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, 
and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by 
individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders (see WARNINGS: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction ). The following adverse reactions have occurred with 
benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired 
concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo. CLONAZEPAM: abuse: The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine 
abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially 
benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol) .

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: Thus, caution should be exercised when administering clonazepam to these patients (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). In children, clearance values of 0.42 ± 0.32 
mL/min/kg (ages 2 to 18 years) and 0.88 ± 0.4 mL/min/kg (ages 7 to 12 years) were reported; these values decreased with increasing body weight. Ketogenic diet in children does not affect clonazepam 
concentrations. Clinical Trials: Panic Disorder: The effectiveness of clonazepam tablets in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of adult 
outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (DSM-IIIR) with or without agoraphobia. CLONAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: In these studies, clonazepam tablets were shown to be significantly
more effective than placebo in treating panic disorder on change from baseline in panic attack frequency, the Clinician’s Global Impression Severity of Illness Score and the Clinician’s Global 
Impression Improvement Score. Study 1 was a 9-week, fixed-dose study involving clonazepam tablets doses of 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in four phases: a 1-week 
placebo lead-in, a 3-week upward titration, a 6-week fixed dose, and a 7-week discontinuance phase. A significant difference from placebo was observed consistently only for the 1 mg/day group. The 
difference between the 1 mg dose group and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 1 panic attack per week. CLONAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: At 
endpoint, 74% of patients receiving clonazepam 1 mg/day were free of full panic attacks, compared to 56% of placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a 6-week, flexible-dose study involving clonazepam 
tablets in a dose range of 0.5 to 4 mg/day or placebo. This study was conducted in three phases: a 1-week placebo lead-in, a 6-week optimal-dose, and a 6-week discontinuance phase. The mean clonazepam
dose during the optimal dosing period was 2.3 mg/day. The difference between clonazepam tablets and placebo in reduction from baseline in the number of full panic attacks was approximately 1 panic 
attack per week. At endpoint, 62% of patients receiving clonazepam were free of full panic attacks, compared to 37% of placebo-treated patients. CLONAZEPAM: clinical_pharmacology: Subgroup analyses 
did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of race or gender.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not take more clonazepam tablets than prescribed 
or take clonazepam tablets for longer than prescribed. Clonazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy and can slow your thinking and motor skills. This may get better over time. Do not drive, operate
heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how clonazepam tablets affect you. Clonazepam tablets may cause problems with your coordination, especially when you are walking or 
picking things up. Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking clonazepam tablets until you talk to your healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or 
drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, clonazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Like other antiepileptic medicines, clonazepam tablets may cause 
suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry 
you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting on dangerous 
impulses new or worse irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) acting aggressive, being angry, or violent other unusual changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early 
symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider 
as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other
than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. Do not stop clonazepam tablets without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping 
clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). What are clonazepam tablets? Clonazepam tablets
are a prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat: certain types of seizure disorders (epilepsy) in adults and children panic disorder with or without fear of open spaces 
(agoraphobia) in adults Clonazepam tablets are a federally controlled substance (C-IV) because it contains clonazepam that can be abused or lead to dependence. Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place 
to prevent misuse and abuse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Selling or giving away clonazepam tablets may harm others, and is against the law. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever abused or been 
dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs. It is not known if clonazepam tablets are safe or effective in treating panic disorder in children younger than 18 years old. Who should 
not take clonazepam tablets? Do not take clonazepam tablets if you: are allergic to benzodiazepines have significant liver disease have an eye disease called acute narrow angle glaucoma Ask your 
healthcare provider if you are not sure if you have any of the problems listed above. Before you take clonazepam tablets, tell your healthcare provider if you: have liver or kidney problems have lung 
problems (respiratory disease) have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior have any other medical problems are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. CLONAZEPAM: 
spl_medguide: Taking clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy may cause your baby to have symptoms of sedation (breathing problems, sluggishness, low muscle tone), and/or withdrawal symptoms (jitteriness,
irritability, restlessness, shaking, excessive crying, feeding problems). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you are pregnant during treatment with clonazepam 
tablets. If you become pregnant while taking clonazepam tablets, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can register by 
calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Clonazepam can pass 
into breast milk. Breastfeeding during treatment with clonazepam tablets may cause your baby to have sleepiness, feeding problems, and decreased weight gain.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General: Worsening of Seizures: When used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, clonazepam tablets may increase the 
incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use 
of valproic acid and clonazepam tablets may produce absence status. Loss of Effect: In some studies, up to 30% of patients who initially responded have shown a loss of anticonvulsant activity, often 
within 3 months of administration. In some cases, dosage adjustment may reestablish efficacy. Laboratory Testing During Long-Term Therapy: Periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable 
during long-term therapy with clonazepam tablets. CLONAZEPAM: general_precautions: Psychiatric and Paradoxical Reactions: Paradoxical reactions, such as agitation, irritability, aggression, anxiety, 
anger, nightmares, hallucinations, and psychoses are known to occur when using benzodiazepines (see ADVERSE REACTIONS: Psychiatric ). Should this occur, the use of the drug should be discontinued 
gradually (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ). Paradoxical reactions are more likely to occur in children and in the elderly. Caution in 
Renally Impaired Patients: Metabolites of clonazepam tablets are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients 
with impaired renal function. Hypersalivation: Clonazepam tablets may produce an increase in salivation. This should be considered before giving the drug to patients who have difficulty handling 
secretions. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Respiratory Depression: Clonazepam tablets may cause respiratory depression and should be used with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function 
(e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea). Porphyria: Clonazepam tablets may have a porphyrogenic effect and should be used with care in patients with porphyria. Information for 
Patients: A clonazepam tablets Medication Guide must be given to the patient each time clonazepam tablets are dispensed, as required by law. Patients should be instructed to take clonazepam tablets 
only as prescribed. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Physicians are advised to discuss the following issues with patients for whom they prescribe clonazepam tablets: Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids: 
Inform patients and caregivers that potentially fatal additive effects may occur if clonazepam tablets are used with opioids and not to use such drugs concomitantly unless supervised by a health care 
provider (see WARNINGS: Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction: Inform patients that the use of clonazepam tablets, even at 
recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics),
alcohol, and/or illicit substances . CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these 
signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Withdrawal Reactions: Inform patients that the continued 
use of clonazepam tablets may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may precipitate acute withdrawal 
reactions, which can be life-threatening. Inform patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to 
more than 12 months. Instruct patients that discontinuation or dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND 
DEPENDENCE ) . CLONAZEPAM: general_precautions: General: Worsening of Seizures: When used in patients in whom several different types of seizure disorders coexist, clonazepam tablets may increase the 
incidence or precipitate the onset of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal). This may require the addition of appropriate anticonvulsants or an increase in their dosages. The concomitant use 
of valproic acid and clonazepam tablets may produce absence status. Loss of Effect: In some studies, up to 30% of patients who initially responded have shown a loss of anticonvulsant activity, often 
within 3 months of administration. In some cases, dosage adjustment may reestablish efficacy. Laboratory Testing During Long-Term Therapy: Periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable 
during long-term therapy with clonazepam tablets. CLONAZEPAM: general_precautions: Respiratory Depression: Clonazepam tablets may cause respiratory depression and should be used with caution in 
patients with compromised respiratory function (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea). Porphyria: Clonazepam tablets may have a porphyrogenic effect and should be used with care in
patients with porphyria. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Interference With Cognitive and Motor Performance: Because benzodiazepines have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills, patients 
should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that clonazepam tablets therapy does not affect them adversely. Suicidal Thinking and 
Behavior: Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including clonazepam tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the 
need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. 
Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers.

drug's effect on the risk of renal failure. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this data whether Clonazepam increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. It is important to note that 
the absence of this information in the FDA label does not necessarily mean that there is no effect; it simply indicates that such effects are not documented or confirmed in the context of the FDA 
label data.
