CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Swelling confined to the face, mucous membranes of the mouth, lips and extremities has usually resolved with discontinuation of treatment; some cases required medical 
therapy. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Captopril .) Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These 
patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was 
diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential 
diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization : Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with 
hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, 
but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure : Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and 
treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. 
Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis : Neutropenia (< 1000/mm 3 ) with myeloid hypoplasia has resulted from use of captopril. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: About half of the neutropenic patients developed systemic or 
oral cavity infections or other features of the syndrome of agranulocytosis. The risk of neutropenia is dependent on the clinical status of the patient: In clinical trials in patients with 
hypertension who have normal renal function (serum creatinine less than 1.6 mg/dL and no collagen vascular disease), neutropenia has been seen in one patient out of over 8,600 exposed. In patients 
with some degree of renal failure (serum creatinine at least 1.6 mg/dL) but no collagen vascular disease, the risk of neutropenia in clinical trials was about 1 per 500, a frequency over 15 times that
for uncomplicated hypertension. Daily doses of captopril were relatively high in these patients, particularly in view of their diminished renal function. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: In foreign marketing 
experience in patients with renal failure, use of allopurinol concomitantly with captopril has been associated with neutropenia but this association has not appeared in U.S. reports. In patients with 
collagen vascular diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma) and impaired renal function, neutropenia occurred in 3.7 percent of patients in clinical trials. While none of the over 750
patients in formal clinical trials of heart failure developed neutropenia, it has occurred during the subsequent clinical experience. About half of the reported cases had serum creatinine ≥ 1.6 mg/dL 
and more than 75 percent were in patients also receiving procainamide. In heart failure, it appears that the same risk factors for neutropenia are present. The neutropenia has usually been detected 
within three months after captopril was started. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Bone marrow examinations in patients with neutropenia consistently showed myeloid hypoplasia, frequently accompanied by erythroid 
hypoplasia and decreased numbers of megakaryocytes (e.g., hypoplastic bone marrow and pancytopenia); anemia and thrombocytopenia were sometimes seen. In general, neutrophils returned to normal in 
about two weeks after captopril was discontinued, and serious infections were limited to clinically complex patients. About 13 percent of the cases of neutropenia have ended fatally, but almost all 
fatalities were in patients with serious illness, having collagen vascular disease, renal failure, heart failure or immunosuppressant therapy, or a combination of these complicating factors. 
Evaluation of the hypertensive or heart failure patient should always include assessment of renal function. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: If captopril is used in patients with impaired renal function, white 
blood cell and differential counts should be evaluated prior to starting treatment and at approximately two-week intervals for about three months, then periodically. In patients with collagen vascular
disease or who are exposed to other drugs known to affect the white cells or immune response, particularly when there is impaired renal function, captopril should be used only after an assessment of 
benefit and risk, and then with caution. All patients treated with captopril should be told to report any signs of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever). If infection is suspected, white cell counts 
should be performed without delay. Since discontinuation of captopril and other drugs has generally led to prompt return of the white count to normal, upon confirmation of neutropenia (neutrophil 
count < 1000/mm 3 ) the physician should withdraw captopril and closely follow the patient’s course. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Proteinuria : Total urinary proteins greater than 1 g per day were seen in 
about 0.7 percent of patients receiving captopril. About 90 percent of affected patients had evidence of prior renal disease or received relatively high doses of captopril (in excess of 150 mg/day), 
or both. The nephrotic syndrome occurred in about one-fifth of proteinuric patients. In most cases, proteinuria subsided or cleared within six months whether or not captopril was continued. Parameters
of renal function, such as BUN and creatinine, were seldom altered in the patients with proteinuria. Hypotension : Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in hypertensive patients but is a possible 
consequence of captopril use in salt/volume depleted persons (such as those treated vigorously with diuretics), patients with heart failure or those patients undergoing renal dialysis. (See 
PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Captopril : Reported incidences are based on clinical trials involving approximately 7000 patients. Renal : About one of 100 patients developed
proteinuria (see WARNINGS ). Each of the following has been reported in approximately 1 to 2 of 1000 patients and are of uncertain relationship to drug use: renal insufficiency, renal failure, 
nephrotic syndrome, polyuria, oliguria, and urinary frequency. Hematologic : Neutropenia/agranulocytosis has occurred (see WARNINGS ). Cases of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been 
reported. Dermatologic : Rash, often with pruritus, and sometimes with fever, arthralgia, and eosinophilia, occurred in about 4 to 7 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients, usually 
during the first four weeks of therapy. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: It is usually maculopapular, and rarely urticarial. The rash is usually mild and disappears within a few days of dosage reduction,
short-term treatment with an antihistaminic agent, and/or discontinuing therapy; remission may occur even if captopril is continued. Pruritus, without rash, occurs in about 2 of 100 patients. Between 
7 and 10 percent of patients with skin rash have shown eosinophilia and/or positive ANA titers. A reversible associated pemphigoid-like lesion, and photosensitivity, have also been reported. Flushing 
or pallor has been reported in 2 to 5 of 1000 patients. Cardiovascular : Hypotension may occur; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (Drug Interactions) for discussion of hypotension with captopril therapy. 
Tachycardia, chest pain, and palpitations have each been observed in approximately 1 of 100 patients. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, Raynaud’s syndrome, and 
congestive heart failure have each occurred in 2 to 3 of 1000 patients. Dysgeusia : Approximately 2 to 4 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients developed a diminution or loss of taste 
perception. Taste impairment is reversible and usually self-limited (2 to 3 months) even with continued drug administration. Weight loss may be associated with the loss of taste. Angioedema : 
Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in approximately one in 1000 patients. Angioedema involving the upper airways has caused
fatal airway obstruction. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Cough : Cough has been
reported in 0.5 to 2% of patients treated with captopril in clinical trials (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Captopril: Cough ). The following have been reported in about 0.5 to 2 percent of patients but 
did not appear at increased frequency compared to placebo or other treatments used in controlled trials: gastric irritation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, 
aphthous ulcers, peptic ulcer, dizziness, headache, malaise, fatigue, insomnia, dry mouth, dyspnea, alopecia, paresthesias. Other clinical adverse effects reported since the drug was marketed are 
listed below by body system. In this setting, an incidence or causal relationship cannot be accurately determined. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Body as a Whole : Anaphylactoid reactions (see 
WARNINGS: Captopril: Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). General : asthenia, gynecomastia. Cardiovascular : cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular 
accident/insufficiency, rhythm disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, syncope. Dermatologic : bullous pemphigus, erythema multiforme (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), exfoliative dermatitis. 
Gastrointestinal : pancreatitis, glossitis, dyspepsia. Hematologic : anemia, including aplastic and hemolytic. Hepatobiliary : jaundice, hepatitis, including rare cases of necrosis, cholestasis. 
Metabolic : symptomatic hyponatremia. Musculoskeletal : myalgia, myasthenia. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Nervous/Psychiatric : ataxia, confusion, depression, nervousness, somnolence. Respiratory : 
bronchospasm, eosinophilic pneumonitis, rhinitis. Special Senses : blurred vision. Urogenital : impotence. As with other ACE inhibitors, a syndrome has been reported which may include: fever, myalgia,
arthralgia, interstitial nephritis, vasculitis, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, eosinophilia and an elevated ESR. Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality: See WARNINGS: Captopril: 
Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality . Hydrochlorothiazide : Gastrointestinal System : anorexia, gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea, constipation, jaundice (intrahepatic 
cholestatic jaundice), pancreatitis, and sialadenitis. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Central Nervous System : dizziness, vertigo, paresthesias, headache, and xanthopsia. Hematologic : leukopenia, 
agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and hemolytic anemia. Cardiovascular : orthostatic hypotension. Hypersensitivity : purpura, photosensitivity, rash, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis 
(vasculitis; cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress including pneumonitis, and anaphylactic reactions. Other : hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia, muscle spasm, weakness, 
restlessness, and transient blurred vision. Whenever adverse reactions are moderate or severe, thiazide dosage should be reduced or therapy withdrawn. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Altered Laboratory 
Findings: Serum Electrolytes : Hyperkalemia: small increases in serum potassium, especially in patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS: Captopril ). Hyponatremia : particularly in patients 
receiving a low sodium diet or concomitant diuretics. BUN/Serum Creatinine : Transient elevations of BUN or serum creatinine especially in volume or salt depleted patients or those with renovascular 
hypertension may occur. Rapid reduction of longstanding or markedly elevated blood pressure can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum 
creatinine. Hematologic : A positive ANA has been reported. Liver Function Tests : Elevations of liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have occurred. CAPTOPRIL: 
adverse_reactions: Postmarketing Experience : Non-melanoma Skin Cancer : Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel 
System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1
additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients taking a cumulative dose of ≥ 50,000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per 
year. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharma Holdings, Inc. at 1-844- 874-7464 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Hydrochlorothiazide : Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology 
Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to 
approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro assays using strains TA 98, TA 100, 
TA 1535, TA 1537 and TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium (Ames assay) and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, 
Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophilia sex linked recessive lethal trait gene. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Positive test results were obtained only in the in vitro CHO Sister 
Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide from 43 to 1300 mcg/mL, and in the Aspergillus nidulans 
non-disjunction assay at an unspecified concentration. Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via 
their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. Animal Toxicology Captopril : Chronic oral toxicity studies were conducted in rats (2 years),
dogs (47 weeks; 1 year), mice (2 years), and monkeys (1 year). Significant drug-related toxicity included effects on hematopoiesis, renal toxicity, erosion/ulceration of the stomach, and variation of 
retinal blood vessels. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Reductions in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit values were seen in mice, rats, and monkeys at doses 50 to 150 times the maximum recommended human dose 
(MRHD). Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow suppression occurred in dogs at doses 8 to 30 times MRHD. The reductions in hemoglobin and hematocrit values in rats and mice were only 
significant at 1 year and returned to normal with continued dosing by the end of the study. Marked anemia was seen at all dose levels (8 to 30 times MRHD) in dogs, whereas moderate to marked 
leukopenia was noted only at 15 and 30 times MRHD and thrombocytopenia at 30 times MRHD. The anemia could be reversed upon discontinuation of dosing. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Bone marrow suppression 
occurred to a varying degree, being associated only with dogs that died or were sacrificed in a moribund condition in the 1 year study. However, in the 47-week study at a dose 30 times MRHD, bone 
marrow suppression was found to be reversible upon continued drug administration. Captopril caused hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys at doses 7 to 200 times the MRHD in rats 
and mice, at 20 to 60 times MRHD in monkeys, and at 30 times the MRHD in dogs. Gastric erosions/ulcerations were increased in incidence at 20 and 200 times MRHD in male rats and at 30 and 65 times 
MRHD in dogs and monkeys, respectively. Rabbits developed gastric and intestinal ulcers when given oral doses approximately 30 times MRHD for only five to seven days. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: In the 
two-year rat study, irreversible and progressive variations in the caliber of retinal vessels (focal sacculations and constrictions) occurred at all dose levels (7 to 200 times MRHD) in a dose-related
fashion. The effect was first observed in the 88 th week of dosing, with a progressively increased incidence thereafter, even after cessation of dosing. Pregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D 
(second and third trimesters): See WARNINGS: Captopril: Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality . Pregnancy: Nonteratogenic Effects: Hydrochlorothiazide : Thiazides cross the placental barrier and 
appear in cord blood. The use of thiazides in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against possible hazards to the fetus. These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice, 
thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions which have occurred in the adult.
