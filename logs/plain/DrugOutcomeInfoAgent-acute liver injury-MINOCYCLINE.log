CONTENT: MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has 
also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula 
growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of
animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has 
been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy  5. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all 
antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to 
overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as 
these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical 
history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed 
against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and 
surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic 
failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this
is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and 
acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 
Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central 
nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving 
vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial 
Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate 
pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Bulging fontanels have been associated with 
the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may 
be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should
be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune 
Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like 
syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, 
rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs 
should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been 
reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be 
outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5. MINOCYCLINE: 
warnings_and_cautions: 9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), 
eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some 
cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline class antibiotics are known to cause 
hyperpigmentation. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity 
(teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue 
pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug Resistant 
Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection
should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop during the use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should
be used only as indicated. 5.

MINOCYCLINE has been associated with an increased risk of acute liver injury. This includes reports of serious liver injury, irreversible drug-induced hepatitis, and fulminant hepatic failure, some of
which have been fatal, as confirmed by FDAHandler referencing the MINOCYCLINE label.
