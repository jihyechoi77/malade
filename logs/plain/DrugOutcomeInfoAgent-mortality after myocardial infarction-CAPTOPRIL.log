CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: description: DESCRIPTION Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, USP for oral administration combines two antihypertensive agents: captopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Captopril, 
the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents, is a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I to 
angiotensin II. Hydrochlorothiazide is a benzothiadiazide (thiazide) diuretic-antihypertensive. Captopril, USP is a white to off-white crystalline powder with characteristic sulfide-like odor; it is 
freely soluble in water, ethanol, methanol, chloroform, isopropyl alcohol and methylene chloride and soluble in ethyl acetate. It dissolves in dilute solution of alkali hydroxide. CAPTOPRIL: 
description: Hydrochlorothiazide, USP is a white or almost white, almost odorless crystalline powder. Very slightly soluble in water, sparingly soluble in Ethanol and Methanol, soluble in Acetone. 
Freely soluble in N,N-Dimethylformamide, in n-Butylamine and in diluted solutions of alkali hydroxides. Practically insoluble in Ether, in Chloroform and in diluted mineral acids. Captopril is 
designated chemically as 1-[(2S)-3-Mercapto-2-methylpropionyl]-L-proline; Hydrochlorothiazide is 6-Chloro-3,4-dihydro-2 H -1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-7-sulfonamide 1,1-dioxide. CAPTOPRIL: description: 
Their structural formulas are: Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are available for oral administration in four combinations of captopril with hydrochlorothiazide: 25 mg with 15 mg, 25 mg with 
25 mg, 50 mg with 15 mg, and 50 mg with 25 mg. In addition, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: anhydrous lactose, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium 
stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch (corn) and sodium lauryl sulfate. The 25 mg/25 mg and 50 mg/25 mg tablets also contain FD&C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake. CAPTOPRIL:

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: information_for_patients: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients should be advised to immediately report to their physician any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling 
of face, eyes, lips, tongue, larynx and extremities; difficulty in swallowing or breathing; hoarseness) and to discontinue therapy. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal 
Angioedema .) Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever), which may be a sign of neutropenia, or of progressive edema which might be related to 
proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume. 
Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure; patients should be advised to consult with the physician. CAPTOPRIL: information_for_patients: 
Patients should be advised not to use potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium-containing salt substitutes without consulting their physician. (See PRECAUTIONS: General and Drug
Interactions: Captopril ; ADVERSE REACTIONS: Captopril .) Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of medication unless instructed by the physician. Heart failure patients on 
captopril therapy should be cautioned against rapid increases in physical activity. Patients should be informed that captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be taken one hour before meals 
(see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).         
SOURCE:CAPTOPRIL label


CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE Captopril : Correction of hypotension would be of primary concern. Volume expansion with an intravenous infusion of normal saline is the treatment of choice 
for restoration of blood pressure. While captopril may be removed from the adult circulation by hemodialysis, there is inadequate data concerning the effectiveness of hemodialysis for removing it from
the circulation of neonates or children. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective for removing captopril; there is no information concerning exchange transfusion for removing captopril from the general 
circulation. Hydrochlorothiazide : In addition to the expected diuresis, overdosage of thiazides may produce varying degrees of lethargy which may progress to coma within a few hours, with minimal 
depression of respiration and cardiovascular function and without evidence of serum electrolyte changes or dehydration. The mechanism of thiazide-induced CNS depression is unknown. Gastrointestinal 
irritation and hypermotility may occur. CAPTOPRIL: overdosage: Transitory increase in BUN has been reported, and serum electrolyte changes may occur, especially in patients with impaired renal 
function. In addition to gastric lavage and supportive therapy for stupor or coma, symptomatic treatment of gastrointestinal effects may be needed. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed 
by hemodialysis has not been clearly established. Measures as required to maintain hydration, electrolyte balance, respiration, and cardiovascular and renal function should be instituted.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS & USAGE Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. The blood pressure lowering effects of 
captopril and thiazides are approximately additive. This fixed combination drug may be used as initial therapy or substituted for previously titrated doses of the individual components. When captopril
and hydrochlorothiazide are given together it may not be necessary to administer captopril in divided doses to attain blood pressure control at trough (before the next dose). Also, with such a 
combination, a daily dose of 15 mg of hydrochlorothiazide may be adequate. Treatment may, therefore, be initiated with captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 25 mg/15 mg once daily. CAPTOPRIL: 
indications_and_usage: Subsequent titration should be with additional doses of the components (captopril, hydrochlorothiazide) as single agents or as captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 50 mg/15
mg, 25 mg/25 mg, or 50 mg/25 mg (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). In using captopril and hydrochlorothiazide, consideration should be given to the risk of neutropenia/agranulocytosis (see WARNINGS ). 
Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide may be used for patients with normal renal function, in whom the risk is relatively low. In patients with impaired renal function, particularly those with collagen 
vascular disease, captopril and hydrochlorothiazide should be reserved for hypertensives who have either developed unacceptable side effects on other drugs, or have failed to respond satisfactorily to
other drug combinations. CAPTOPRIL: indications_and_usage: ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: 
Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema ).         
SOURCE:CAPTOPRIL label


CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: general_precautions: General : Captopril : Impaired Renal Function : Some patients with renal disease, particularly those with severe renal artery stenosis, have developed 
increases in BUN and serum creatinine after reduction of blood pressure with captopril. Captopril dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of diuretic may be required. For some of these patients, it 
may not be possible to normalize blood pressure and maintain adequate renal perfusion (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , ADVERSE REACTIONS: Altered Laboratory Findings ). 
Hyperkalemia : Elevations in serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including captopril. CAPTOPRIL: general_precautions: When treated with ACE inhibitors, 
patients at risk for the development of hyperkalemia include those with: renal insufficiency; diabetes mellitus; and those using concomitant potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or 
potassium-containing salt substitutes; or other drugs associated with increases in serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and Drug Interactions: Captopril ; ADVERSE REACTIONS: 
Altered Laboratory Findings .) Cough : Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always 
resolving after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Surgery/Anesthesia : In patients undergoing major surgery or during
anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, captopril will block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. CAPTOPRIL: general_precautions: If hypotension occurs and is 
considered to be due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion. Hemodialysis : Recent clinical observations have shown an association of hypersensitivity-like (anaphylactoid) 
reactions during hemodialysis with high-flux dialysis membranes (e.g., AN69) in patients receiving ACE inhibitors as medication. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different 
type of dialysis membrane or a different class of medication. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure ). Hydrochlorothiazide : Periodic determination of serum 
electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals. All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or 
electrolyte imbalance, namely: hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. CAPTOPRIL: general_precautions: Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the 
patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance may include: dryness of mouth, thirst, weakness, lethargy, drowsiness, 
restlessness, muscle pains or cramps, muscular fatigue, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting. Hypokalemia may develop, especially with 
brisk diuresis, or when severe cirrhosis is present. Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can sensitize or exaggerate the response of the
heart to the toxic effects of digitalis (e.g., increased ventricular irritability). Because captopril reduces the production of aldosterone, concomitant therapy with captopril reduces the 
diuretic-induced hypokalemia.         
SOURCE:CAPTOPRIL label


CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: warnings: ) Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality : ACE inhibitors can cause fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women. Several dozen cases have 
been reported in the world literature. When pregnancy is detected, ACE inhibitors should be discontinued as soon as possible. The use of ACE inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy has been associated with fetal and neonatal injury, including hypotension, neonatal skull hypoplasia, anuria, reversible or irreversible renal failure, and death. Oligohydramnios has also 
been reported, presumably resulting from decreased fetal renal function; oligohydramnios in this setting has been associated with fetal limb contractures, craniofacial deformation, and hypoplastic 
lung development. Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and patent ductus arteriosus have also been reported, although it is not clear whether these occurrences were due to the ACE-inhibitor 
exposure. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: These adverse effects do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. Mothers whose embryos and 
fetuses are exposed to ACE inhibitors only during the first trimester should be so informed. Nonetheless, when patients become pregnant, physicians should make every effort to discontinue the use of 
captopril as soon as possible. Rarely (probably less often than once in every thousand pregnancies), no alternative to ACE inhibitors will be found. In these rare cases, the mothers should be apprised
of the potential hazards to their fetuses, and serial ultrasound examinations should be performed to assess the intraamniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, captopril should be 
discontinued unless it is considered life-saving for the mother. Contraction stress testing (CST), a non-stress test (NST), or biophysical profiling (BPP) may be appropriate, depending upon the week 
of pregnancy. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. Infants with histories
of in utero exposure to ACE inhibitors should be closely observed for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia. If oliguria occurs, attention should be directed toward support of blood pressure and 
renal perfusion. Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal function. While captopril may be removed from the adult 
circulation by hemodialysis, there is inadequate data concerning the effectiveness of hemodialysis for removing it from the circulation of neonates or children. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective 
for removing captopril; there is no information concerning exchange transfusion for removing captopril from the general circulation. When captopril was given to rabbits at doses about 0. CAPTOPRIL: 
warnings: 8 to 70 times (on a mg/kg basis) the maximum recommended human dose, low incidences of craniofacial malformations were seen. No teratogenic effects of captopril were seen in studies of 
pregnant rats and hamsters. On a mg/kg basis, the doses used were up to 150 times (in hamsters) and 625 times (in rats) the maximum recommended human dose. Hepatic Failure : Rarely, ACE Inhibitors 
have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood. 
Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. Hydrochlorothiazide : 
Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in 
patients with impaired renal function. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte 
balance may precipitate hepatic coma. Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic 
lupus erythematosus has been reported. In general, lithium should not be given with diuretics (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Hydrochlorothiazide ).

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Captopril : Reported incidences are based on clinical trials involving approximately 7000 patients. Renal : About one of 100 patients developed
proteinuria (see WARNINGS ). Each of the following has been reported in approximately 1 to 2 of 1000 patients and are of uncertain relationship to drug use: renal insufficiency, renal failure, 
nephrotic syndrome, polyuria, oliguria, and urinary frequency. Hematologic : Neutropenia/agranulocytosis has occurred (see WARNINGS ). Cases of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been 
reported. Dermatologic : Rash, often with pruritus, and sometimes with fever, arthralgia, and eosinophilia, occurred in about 4 to 7 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients, usually 
during the first four weeks of therapy. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: It is usually maculopapular, and rarely urticarial. The rash is usually mild and disappears within a few days of dosage reduction,
short-term treatment with an antihistaminic agent, and/or discontinuing therapy; remission may occur even if captopril is continued. Pruritus, without rash, occurs in about 2 of 100 patients. Between 
7 and 10 percent of patients with skin rash have shown eosinophilia and/or positive ANA titers. A reversible associated pemphigoid-like lesion, and photosensitivity, have also been reported. Flushing 
or pallor has been reported in 2 to 5 of 1000 patients. Cardiovascular : Hypotension may occur; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (Drug Interactions) for discussion of hypotension with captopril therapy. 
Tachycardia, chest pain, and palpitations have each been observed in approximately 1 of 100 patients. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, Raynaud’s syndrome, and 
congestive heart failure have each occurred in 2 to 3 of 1000 patients. Dysgeusia : Approximately 2 to 4 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients developed a diminution or loss of taste 
perception. Taste impairment is reversible and usually self-limited (2 to 3 months) even with continued drug administration. Weight loss may be associated with the loss of taste. Angioedema : 
Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in approximately one in 1000 patients. Angioedema involving the upper airways has caused
fatal airway obstruction. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ).

ANSWER: Captopril is an antihypertensive medication that combines with hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension. It is a specific competitive inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), 
responsible for converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic-antihypertensive. Captopril is available in different combinations with hydrochlorothiazide for 
oral administration. Patients should be advised to report any signs of angioedema or infection and to avoid potassium supplements without consulting their physician. Overdosage of captopril primarily 
requires correction of hypotension, and while it can be removed from the adult circulation by hemodialysis, its effectiveness in neonates or children is not well-established. Captopril is indicated 
for the treatment of hypertension and may be used as initial therapy or substituted for previously titrated doses of the individual components. It should be used with caution in patients with impaired
renal function or those at risk for hyperkalemia. ACE inhibitors like captopril have been associated with fetal and neonatal morbidity and death when administered to pregnant women and should be 
discontinued as soon as pregnancy is detected. Adverse reactions to captopril can include renal issues, hematologic changes, dermatologic reactions, cardiovascular effects, dysgeusia, and angioedema.

that Captopril is an ACE inhibitor used primarily for the treatment of hypertension, often in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic. The label information does not directly address
the specific question of whether Captopril increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction (heart attack). 

ACE inhibitors, as a class, are known to have benefits in patients with heart failure and after myocardial infarction, as they can help improve survival rates and reduce the risk of subsequent heart 
attacks. However, the FDA label data provided does not specify the degree of risk reduction or the impact on mortality post-myocardial infarction for Captopril specifically.

Given that the FDA label data does not specify the answer to the question of whether Captopril increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, my final answer must be 
DO-NOT-KNOW. The degree of reliability of this answer is based on the absence of specific information in the FDA label data regarding the effect of Captopril on mortality post-myocardial infarction.

        Question: Does CAPTOPRIL increase or decrease the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I requested information from FDAHandler about Captopril.
2. FDAHandler provided information about Captopril, indicating it is an ACE inhibitor used for the treatment of hypertension, often in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.
3. The FDA label information provided does not directly address the specific question of whether Captopril increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
4. Given the absence of specific information in the FDA label data regarding the effect of Captopril on mortality post-myocardial infarction, I must answer DO-NOT-KNOW.
        -----
        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data provided by FDAHandler does not directly address the question of whether Captopril increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Therefore, I cannot 
provide a definitive answer based on the specific FDA label information available. The degree of reliability of this answer is based on the absence of specific information in the FDA label data 
regarding the effect of Captopril on mortality post-myocardial infarction.
