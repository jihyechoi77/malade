CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Captopril : Reported incidences are based on clinical trials involving approximately 7000 patients. Renal : About one of 100 patients developed
proteinuria (see WARNINGS ). Each of the following has been reported in approximately 1 to 2 of 1000 patients and are of uncertain relationship to drug use: renal insufficiency, renal failure, 
nephrotic syndrome, polyuria, oliguria, and urinary frequency. Hematologic : Neutropenia/agranulocytosis has occurred (see WARNINGS ). Cases of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been 
reported. Dermatologic : Rash, often with pruritus, and sometimes with fever, arthralgia, and eosinophilia, occurred in about 4 to 7 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients, usually 
during the first four weeks of therapy. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: It is usually maculopapular, and rarely urticarial. The rash is usually mild and disappears within a few days of dosage reduction,
short-term treatment with an antihistaminic agent, and/or discontinuing therapy; remission may occur even if captopril is continued. Pruritus, without rash, occurs in about 2 of 100 patients. Between 
7 and 10 percent of patients with skin rash have shown eosinophilia and/or positive ANA titers. A reversible associated pemphigoid-like lesion, and photosensitivity, have also been reported. Flushing 
or pallor has been reported in 2 to 5 of 1000 patients. Cardiovascular : Hypotension may occur; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (Drug Interactions) for discussion of hypotension with captopril therapy. 
Tachycardia, chest pain, and palpitations have each been observed in approximately 1 of 100 patients. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, Raynaud’s syndrome, and 
congestive heart failure have each occurred in 2 to 3 of 1000 patients. Dysgeusia : Approximately 2 to 4 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients developed a diminution or loss of taste 
perception. Taste impairment is reversible and usually self-limited (2 to 3 months) even with continued drug administration. Weight loss may be associated with the loss of taste. Angioedema : 
Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in approximately one in 1000 patients. Angioedema involving the upper airways has caused
fatal airway obstruction. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Cough : Cough has been
reported in 0.5 to 2% of patients treated with captopril in clinical trials (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Captopril: Cough ). The following have been reported in about 0.5 to 2 percent of patients but 
did not appear at increased frequency compared to placebo or other treatments used in controlled trials: gastric irritation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, 
aphthous ulcers, peptic ulcer, dizziness, headache, malaise, fatigue, insomnia, dry mouth, dyspnea, alopecia, paresthesias. Other clinical adverse effects reported since the drug was marketed are 
listed below by body system. In this setting, an incidence or causal relationship cannot be accurately determined. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Body as a Whole : Anaphylactoid reactions (see 
WARNINGS: Captopril: Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). General : asthenia, gynecomastia. Cardiovascular : cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular 
accident/insufficiency, rhythm disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, syncope. Dermatologic : bullous pemphigus, erythema multiforme (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), exfoliative dermatitis. 
Gastrointestinal : pancreatitis, glossitis, dyspepsia. Hematologic : anemia, including aplastic and hemolytic. Hepatobiliary : jaundice, hepatitis, including rare cases of necrosis, cholestasis. 
Metabolic : symptomatic hyponatremia. Musculoskeletal : myalgia, myasthenia.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: warnings: About half of the neutropenic patients developed systemic or oral cavity infections or other features of the syndrome of agranulocytosis. The risk of neutropenia is 
dependent on the clinical status of the patient: In clinical trials in patients with hypertension who have normal renal function (serum creatinine less than 1.6 mg/dL and no collagen vascular 
disease), neutropenia has been seen in one patient out of over 8,600 exposed. In patients with some degree of renal failure (serum creatinine at least 1.6 mg/dL) but no collagen vascular disease, the 
risk of neutropenia in clinical trials was about 1 per 500, a frequency over 15 times that for uncomplicated hypertension. Daily doses of captopril were relatively high in these patients, particularly
in view of their diminished renal function. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: In foreign marketing experience in patients with renal failure, use of allopurinol concomitantly with captopril has been associated 
with neutropenia but this association has not appeared in U.S. reports. In patients with collagen vascular diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma) and impaired renal function, 
neutropenia occurred in 3.7 percent of patients in clinical trials. While none of the over 750 patients in formal clinical trials of heart failure developed neutropenia, it has occurred during the 
subsequent clinical experience. About half of the reported cases had serum creatinine ≥ 1.6 mg/dL and more than 75 percent were in patients also receiving procainamide. In heart failure, it appears 
that the same risk factors for neutropenia are present. The neutropenia has usually been detected within three months after captopril was started. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Bone marrow examinations in 
patients with neutropenia consistently showed myeloid hypoplasia, frequently accompanied by erythroid hypoplasia and decreased numbers of megakaryocytes (e.g., hypoplastic bone marrow and 
pancytopenia); anemia and thrombocytopenia were sometimes seen. In general, neutrophils returned to normal in about two weeks after captopril was discontinued, and serious infections were limited to 
clinically complex patients. About 13 percent of the cases of neutropenia have ended fatally, but almost all fatalities were in patients with serious illness, having collagen vascular disease, renal 
failure, heart failure or immunosuppressant therapy, or a combination of these complicating factors. Evaluation of the hypertensive or heart failure patient should always include assessment of renal 
function. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: If captopril is used in patients with impaired renal function, white blood cell and differential counts should be evaluated prior to starting treatment and at 
approximately two-week intervals for about three months, then periodically. In patients with collagen vascular disease or who are exposed to other drugs known to affect the white cells or immune 
response, particularly when there is impaired renal function, captopril should be used only after an assessment of benefit and risk, and then with caution. All patients treated with captopril should 
be told to report any signs of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever). If infection is suspected, white cell counts should be performed without delay. Since discontinuation of captopril and other drugs 
has generally led to prompt return of the white count to normal, upon confirmation of neutropenia (neutrophil count < 1000/mm 3 ) the physician should withdraw captopril and closely follow the 
patient’s course. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Proteinuria : Total urinary proteins greater than 1 g per day were seen in about 0.7 percent of patients receiving captopril. About 90 percent of affected 
patients had evidence of prior renal disease or received relatively high doses of captopril (in excess of 150 mg/day), or both. The nephrotic syndrome occurred in about one-fifth of proteinuric 
patients. In most cases, proteinuria subsided or cleared within six months whether or not captopril was continued. Parameters of renal function, such as BUN and creatinine, were seldom altered in the 
patients with proteinuria. Hypotension : Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of captopril use in salt/volume depleted persons (such as those 
treated vigorously with diuretics), patients with heart failure or those patients undergoing renal dialysis. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Positive test results were obtained only in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using 
concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide from 43 to 1300 mcg/mL, and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunction assay at an unspecified concentration. Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the 
fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. 
Animal Toxicology Captopril : Chronic oral toxicity studies were conducted in rats (2 years), dogs (47 weeks; 1 year), mice (2 years), and monkeys (1 year). Significant drug-related toxicity included 
effects on hematopoiesis, renal toxicity, erosion/ulceration of the stomach, and variation of retinal blood vessels. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Reductions in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit values were seen
in mice, rats, and monkeys at doses 50 to 150 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow suppression occurred in dogs at doses 8 to 30 times
MRHD. The reductions in hemoglobin and hematocrit values in rats and mice were only significant at 1 year and returned to normal with continued dosing by the end of the study. Marked anemia was seen 
at all dose levels (8 to 30 times MRHD) in dogs, whereas moderate to marked leukopenia was noted only at 15 and 30 times MRHD and thrombocytopenia at 30 times MRHD. The anemia could be reversed upon 
discontinuation of dosing. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Bone marrow suppression occurred to a varying degree, being associated only with dogs that died or were sacrificed in a moribund condition in the 1 
year study. However, in the 47-week study at a dose 30 times MRHD, bone marrow suppression was found to be reversible upon continued drug administration. Captopril caused hyperplasia of the 
juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys at doses 7 to 200 times the MRHD in rats and mice, at 20 to 60 times MRHD in monkeys, and at 30 times the MRHD in dogs. Gastric erosions/ulcerations were 
increased in incidence at 20 and 200 times MRHD in male rats and at 30 and 65 times MRHD in dogs and monkeys, respectively. Rabbits developed gastric and intestinal ulcers when given oral doses 
approximately 30 times MRHD for only five to seven days. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: In the two-year rat study, irreversible and progressive variations in the caliber of retinal vessels (focal 
sacculations and constrictions) occurred at all dose levels (7 to 200 times MRHD) in a dose-related fashion. The effect was first observed in the 88 th week of dosing, with a progressively increased 
incidence thereafter, even after cessation of dosing. Pregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters): See WARNINGS: Captopril: Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality . 
Pregnancy: Nonteratogenic Effects: Hydrochlorothiazide : Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. The use of thiazides in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be
weighed against possible hazards to the fetus. These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions which have occurred in the adult. CAPTOPRIL: 
precautions: Nursing Mothers Both captopril and hydrochlorothiazide are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from both drugs, a decision 
should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy taking into account the importance of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide to the mother. (See PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use. ) 
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. There is limited experience reported in the literature with the use of captopril in the pediatric population; 
dosage, on a weight basis, was generally reported to be comparable to or less than that used in adults. Infants, especially newborns, may be more susceptible to the adverse hemodynamic effects of 
captopril. Excessive, prolonged and un-predictable decreases in blood pressure and associated complications, including oliguria and seizures, have been reported.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Captopril : Mechanism of Action : The mechanism of action of captopril has not yet been fully elucidated. Its beneficial effects in 
hypertension and heart failure appear to result primarily from suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. However, there is no consistent correlation between renin levels and response to
the drug. Renin, an enzyme synthesized by the kidneys, is released into the circulation where it acts on a plasma globulin substrate to produce angiotensin I, a relatively inactive decapeptide. 
Angiotensin I is then converted by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to angiotensin II, a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor substance. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion from the 
adrenal cortex, thereby contributing to sodium and fluid retention. CAPTOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Captopril prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibition of ACE, a 
peptidyldipeptide carboxy hydrolase. This inhibition has been demonstrated in both healthy human subjects and in animals by showing that the elevation of blood pressure caused by exogenously 
administered angiotensin I was attenuated or abolished by captopril. In animal studies, captopril did not alter the pressor responses to a number of other agents, including angiotensin II and 
norepinephrine, indicating specificity of action. ACE is identical to “bradykininase”, and captopril may also interfere with the degradation of the vasodepressor peptide, bradykinin. Increased 
concentrations of bradykinin or prostaglandin E 2 may also have a role in the therapeutic effect of captopril. CAPTOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma 
angiotensin II and increased plasma renin activity (PRA), the latter resulting from loss of negative feedback on renin release caused by reduction in angiotensin II. The reduction of angiotensin II 
leads to decreased aldosterone secretion, and, as a result, small increases in serum potassium may occur along with sodium and fluid loss. The antihypertensive effects persist for a longer period of 
time than does demonstrable inhibition of circulating ACE. It is not known whether the ACE present in vascular endothelium is inhibited longer than the ACE in circulating blood. Pharmacokinetics: 
After oral administration of therapeutic doses of captopril, rapid absorption occurs with peak blood levels at about one hour. The presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract reduces absorption by 
about 30 to 40 percent; captopril therefore should be given one hour before meals. Based on carbon-14 labeling, average minimal absorption is approximately 75 percent. CAPTOPRIL: 
clinical_pharmacology: In a 24-hour period, over 95 percent of the absorbed dose is eliminated in the urine; 40 to 50 percent is unchanged drug; most of the remainder is the disulfide dimer of 
captopril and captopril-cysteine disulfide. Approximately 25 to 30 percent of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. The apparent elimination half-life for total radioactivity in blood is 
probably less than three hours. An accurate determination of half-life of unchanged captopril is not, at present, possible, but it is probably less than two hours. In patients with renal impairment, 
however, retention of captopril occurs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pharmacodynamics: Administration of captopril results in a reduction of peripheral arterial resistance in hypertensive patients
with either no change, or an increase, in cardiac output. There is an increase in renal blood flow following administration of captopril and glomerular filtration rate is usually unchanged. CAPTOPRIL:
clinical_pharmacology: In patients with heart failure, significantly decreased peripheral (systemic vascular) resistance and blood pressure (afterload), reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 
(preload) and pulmonary vascular resistance, increased cardiac output, and increased exercise tolerance time (ETT) have been demonstrated. Reductions of blood pressure are usually maximal 60 to 90 
minutes after oral administration of an individual dose of captopril. The duration of effect is dose related and is extended in the presence of a thiazide-type diuretic. The full effect of a given 
dose may not be attained for 6 to 8 weeks (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The blood pressure lowering effects of captopril and thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In contrast, captopril and 
beta-blockers have a less than additive effect. Blood pressure is lowered to about the same extent in both standing and supine positions.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: pregnancy: Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors, and they should also be 
told that these consequences do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. These patients should be asked to report pregnancies 
to their physicians as soon as possible.

The question was whether CAPTOPRIL increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, CAPTOPRIL has been reported to cause myocardial infarction
in approximately 2 to 3 out of 1000 patients, which is considered a relatively low incidence. This data comes from clinical trials involving around 7000 patients. However, it is important to note that
the causal relationship between CAPTOPRIL and myocardial infarction is uncertain. Therefore, while there is a reported incidence of myocardial infarction in patients taking CAPTOPRIL, it cannot be 
definitively stated that CAPTOPRIL increases the risk due to the uncertainty of the causal relationship.
