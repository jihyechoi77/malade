                Passages:
                1. Drug DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: The FDA label data does not specify whether DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, I cannot provide a 
definitive answer based on the available information from the FDA.

 DO-NOT-KNOW

Justification: The FDAHandler has indicated that the information regarding the impact of DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE on the risk of myocardial infarction is not available in the FDA label data. Without this 
specific information, it is not possible to determine the relationship between DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE and myocardial infarction risk.
2. Drug TIGECYCLINE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for TIGECYCLINE does not mention an increased or decreased risk of myocardial infarction, so I cannot provide a definitive answer to whether TIGECYCLINE increases or decreases the risk 
of myocardial infarction.
3. Drug MINOCYCLINE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data does not specify whether MINOCYCLINE increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question.

                Does the tetracycline category of drugs increase the risk of
                myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the tetracycline category of drugs increase the risk of myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label data for DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE does not specify any impact on the risk of myocardial infarction.
2. The FDA label for TIGECYCLINE also does not mention an increased or decreased risk of myocardial infarction.
3. Similarly, the FDA label data for MINOCYCLINE does not specify its impact on the risk of myocardial infarction.
4. Since none of the provided passages for the tetracycline drugs (DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE, TIGECYCLINE, MINOCYCLINE) offer information on their effect on myocardial infarction risk, there is no clear 
evidence to suggest that the tetracycline category of drugs has an effect on the risk of myocardial infarction.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the tetracycline category of drugs on the risk of myocardial infarction based on the provided passages.
