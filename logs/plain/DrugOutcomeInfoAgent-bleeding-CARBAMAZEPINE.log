CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: STUDIES IN PATIENTS OF CHINESE ANCESTRY HAVE FOUND A STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE RISK OF DEVELOPING SJS/TEN AND THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502, AN INHERITED 
ALLELIC VARIANT OF THE HLA-B GENE. HLA-B*1502 IS FOUND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY ACROSS BROAD AREAS OF ASIA. PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY IN GENETICALLY AT-RISK POPULATIONS SHOULD BE 
SCREENED FOR THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502 PRIOR TO INITIATING TREATMENT WITH CARBAMAZEPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES. CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: PATIENTS TESTING POSITIVE FOR THE ALLELE SHOULD NOT BE
TREATED WITH CARBAMAZEPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES UNLESS THE BENEFIT CLEARLY OUTWEIGHS THE RISK ( SEE WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS/LABORATORY TESTS ). APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS APLASTIC 
ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF CARBAMAZEPINE. DATA FROM A POPULATION-BASED CASE-CONTROL STUDY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RISK OF DEVELOPING THESE REACTIONS IS 5
to 8 TIMES GREATER THAN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: HOWEVER, THE OVERALL RISK OF THESE REACTIONS IN THE UNTREATED GENERAL POPULATION IS LOW, APPROXIMATELY SIX PATIENTS PER
ONE MILLION POPULATION PER YEAR FOR AGRANULOCYTOSIS AND TWO PATIENTS PER ONE MILLION POPULATION PER YEAR FOR APLASTIC ANEMIA. ALTHOUGH REPORTS OF TRANSIENT OR PERSISTENT DECREASED PLATELET OR WHITE 
BLOOD CELL COUNTS ARE NOT UNCOMMON IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF CARBAMAZEPINE, DATA ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO ESTIMATE ACCURATELY THEIR INCIDENCE OR OUTCOME. HOWEVER, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CASES OF 
LEUKOPENIA HAVE NOT PROGRESSED TO THE MORE SERIOUS CONDITIONS OF APLASTIC ANEMIA OR AGRANULOCYTOSIS. CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: BECAUSE OF THE VERY LOW INCIDENCE OF AGRANULOCYTOSIS AND APLASTIC 
ANEMIA, THE VAST MAJORITY OF MINOR HEMATOLOGIC CHANGES OBSERVED IN MONITORING OF PATIENTS ON CARBAMAZEPINE ARE UNLIKELY TO SIGNAL THE OCCURRENCE OF EITHER ABNORMALITY. NONETHELESS, COMPLETE 
PRETREATMENT HEMATOLOGICAL TESTING SHOULD BE OBTAINED AS A BASELINE. IF A PATIENT IN THE COURSE OF TREATMENT EXHIBITS LOW OR DECREASED WHITE BLOOD CELL OR PLATELET COUNTS, THE PATIENT SHOULD BE 
MONITORED CLOSELY. DISCONTINUATION OF THE DRUG SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IF ANY EVIDENCE OF SIGNIFICANT BONE MARROW DEPRESSION DEVELOPS.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including carbamazepine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and 
behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, 
behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, 
patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products. Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in 
combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive sedative effect. Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or 
automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. 
This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 (see Warnings-Usage in Pregnancy ). 
If necessary, the carbamazepine extended-release capsules can be opened and the contents sprinkled over food, such as a teaspoon of applesauce or other similar food products. Carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules or their contents should not be crushed or chewed. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to 
their doctors the use of any other prescription or non-prescription medication or herbal products. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the availability of a Medication 
Guide, and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide prior to taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. CARBAMAZEPINE: precautions: See FDA approved Medication Guide. Laboratory 
Tests For genetically at-risk patients (see WARNINGS ), high-resolution ‘ HLA-B*1502 typing ’ is recommended. The test is positive if either one or two HLA-B*1502 alleles are detected and negative if 
no HLA-B*1502 alleles are detected. Complete pretreatment blood counts, including platelets and possibly reticulocytes and serum iron, should be obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of 
treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone 
marrow depression develops. Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must be performed during treatment with this drug since liver
damage may occur (see PRECAUTIONS , General and ADVERSE REACTIONS , Liver ). CARBAMAZEPINE: laboratory_tests: Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be discontinued based on clinical 
judgement, if indicated by newly occurring or worsening clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction or hepatic damage, or in the case of active liver disease. Baseline and periodic eye 
examinations, including slit-lamp, funduscopy, and tonometry, are recommended since many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes. Baseline and periodic complete 
urinalysis and BUN determinations are recommended for patients treated with this agent because of observed renal dysfunction. Increases in total cholesterol, LDL and HDL have been observed in some 
patients taking anticonvulsants. Therefore, periodic evaluation of these parameters is also recommended. Monitoring of blood levels (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) has increased the efficacy and safety 
of anticonvulsants. This monitoring may be particularly useful in cases of dramatic increase in seizure frequency and for verification of compliance. CARBAMAZEPINE: precautions: In addition, 
measurement of drug serum levels may aid in determining the cause of toxicity when more than one medication is being used. Thyroid function tests have been reported to show decreased values with 
carbamazepine administered alone. Interference with some pregnancy tests has been reported. Drug Interactions Clinically meaningful drug interactions have occurred with concomitant medications and 
include, but are not limited to the following: Agents Highly Bound to Plasma Protein: Carbamazepine is not highly bound to plasma proteins; therefore, administration of carbamazepine extended-release 
capsules to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound should not cause increased free concentrations of the other drug.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Medication Guide Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules (kar” ba maz’ e peen) Medication Guide available at https://www.apotex.com/products/us/mg.asp Read this 
Medication Guide before you start taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to 
your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. What is the most important information I should know about carbamazepine extended-release capsules? Do not stop taking carbamazepine
extended-release capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping carbamazepine extended-release capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Carbamazepine extended-release 
capsules can cause serious side effects, including: 1. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may cause rare but serious rashes that may lead to death. CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: These serious skin
reactions are more likely to happen within the first four months of carbamazepine extended-release capsules treatment but may occur at later times. These reactions can happen in anyone, but are more 
likely in people of Asian descent. If you are of Asian descent you may need a genetic blood test before you take carbamazepine extended-release capsules to see if you are at a higher risk for serious 
skin reactions with this medicine. Symptoms may include: skin rash hives sores in your mouth blistering or peeling of the skin 2. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules can also cause other types of 
allergic reactions or serious problems that may affect organs and other parts of your body such as your liver or blood cells. You may or may not have a rash when you get these types of reactions. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms: swelling of your face, eyes, lips, or tongue trouble swallowing or breathing frequent fevers or
fevers that do not go away frequent infections or an infection that does not go away unusual bruising or bleeding red or purple spots on your body severe fatigue or weakness unexpected muscle pain 
that does not go away swollen glands that do not go away yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes loss of appetite (anorexia) that does not go away nausea or vomiting that does not go away 
These symptoms may be the first signs of a serious reaction. A healthcare provider should examine you to decide if you should continue taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. 3. Like other 
antiepileptic drugs, carbamazepine extended-release capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Call your healthcare 
provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempt to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse 
anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) new or worse irritability acting aggressive, being angry, or violent acting on dangerous impulses an extreme increase in 
activity and talking (mania) other unusual changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in 
mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried 
about symptoms. Do not stop carbamazepine extended-release capsules without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping carbamazepine extended-release capsules suddenly can cause serious 
problems. CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other
causes. What is carbamazepine extended-release capsule? Carbamazepine extended-release capsule is a medicine used to treat: certain types of seizures (partial, tonic-clonic, mixed) certain types of 
nerve pain (trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia). Carbamazepine extended-release capsule is not a regular pain medicine and should not be used for aches or pains. Who should not take 
carbamazepine extended-release capsules? Do not take carbamazepine extended-release capsules if you: have a history of bone marrow depression are allergic to carbamazepine or any of the ingredients in
carbamazepine extended-release capsules. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in carbamazepine extended-release capsules.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole), cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, dalfopristin, danazol, dantrolene, delavirdine, diltiazem,
erythromycin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, ibuprofen, isoniazid, loratadine, macrolides, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, olanzapine, omeprazole, oxybutynin, protease inhibitors, 
propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, ticlopidine, troleandomycin, valproate, verapamil, zileuton. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Human microsomal epoxide hydrolase has been identified as the enzyme
responsible for the formation of the 10,11-transdiol derivative from carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide. Coadministration of inhibitors of human microsomal epoxide hydrolase may result in increased 
carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide plasma concentrations. Accordingly, the dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be adjusted and/or the plasma levels monitored when used concomitantly with
loxapine, quetiapine, or valproic acid. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these 
CYP3A4 or epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, it is reasonable to expect that a dose reduction for carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Agents that 
Induce Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes : Carbamazepine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the potential exists for interaction between carbamazepine and any agent that induces CYP3A4. Agents that are CYP
inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of carbamazepine extended-release capsules include, for example, the following: Aminophylline, cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, 
felbamate, fosphenytoin, methsuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin( 1 ), primidone, rifampin and theophylline. (1) Phenytoin plasma levels have also been reported to increase and decrease in the presence
of carbamazepine, see below. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on carbamazepine extended-release capsules, and then begins a course of treatment
with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be necessary. Agents with Decreased Levels in the Presence of 
Carbamazepine due to Induction of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: Carbamazepine is a potent inducer of hepatic CYP3A4 and is also known to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and may therefore reduce plasma
concentrations of co-medications mainly metabolized by CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and 3A4, through induction of their metabolism. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: When used concomitantly with carbamazepine
extended-release capsules, monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment of these agents may be necessary: When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be doubled. 
Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. If carbamazepine is later withdrawn, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When carbamazepine is used with tacrolimus, monitoring 
of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are recommended. The use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine should be avoided with temsirolimus. If 
patients must be coadministered carbamazepine with temsirolimus, an adjustment of temsirolimus dosage should be considered. The use of carbamazepine with lapatinib should generally be avoided. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: If carbamazepine is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up. If carbamazepine is discontinued, the 
lapatinib dose should be reduced. Concomitant use of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic 
effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monitor concentrations of valproate when carbamazepine extended-release capsules are introduced 
or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In addition, carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of, for example, the following drugs,
for which monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment may be necessary: Acetaminophen, albendazole, alprazolam, aprepitant, buprenorphine, apixaban( 6 ), bupropion, buspirone, citalopram, 
clobazam, clonazepam, clozapine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone), cyclosporin, dabigatran( 6 ), delavirdine, desipramine, diazepam, dicumarol, dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: felodipine), doxycycline, edoxaban( 6 ), eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, everolimus, felbamate, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, 
levothyroxine, lorazepam, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives( 2 ), oxcarbazepine, paliperidone, phenytoin( 3
), praziquantel, protease inhibitors, quetiapine, risperidone, rivaroxaban( 6 ), sertraline, sirolimus, tadalafil, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, triazolam, trazodone CARBAMAZEPINE: 
drug_interactions: ( 4 ), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin (5) , ziprasidone, and zonisamide. ( 2 ) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with
hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be 
decreased. Breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancies have been reported with carbamazepine. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered. ( 3 ) Phenytoin has also been 
reported to increase in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ( 4 ) 
Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine )
by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values. (5) Warfarin’s anticoagulant effect can be reduced in the presence of carbamazepine. (6) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban (direct acting oral anticoagulants) is expected to result in decreased plasma concentrations of these anticoagulants that may be insufficient to achieve
the intended therapeutic effect. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In general, coadministration of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban should be avoided. Thus, if a 
patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that 
a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary. Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine Carbamazepine extended-release capsules increase the plasma levels of the 
following agents. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules,
it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin( 7 ), and Primidone Carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules can increase the concentrations of clomipramine, phenytoin, and primidone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of these agents in this category, and then
begins treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these drugs. ( 7 )Phenytoin has also been reported to decrease in the presence of 
carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide is an inactive prodrug and is converted to its 
active metabolite in part by CYP3A. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide are reportedly increased by chronic co-administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers. There is a potential for increased cyclophosphamide toxicity when coadministered with carbamazepine. Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Carbamazepine: Delavirdine 
Coadministration of carbamazepine with delavirdine may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Lithium Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects. Thyroid Effects with Other Anticonvulsant Medications Alterations
of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Chloroquine and Mefloquine Anti-malarial drugs, such as 
chloroquine and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of carbamazepine. Thus if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of 
treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose adjustment may be necessary. CNS Depressants The concomitant use of carbamazepine extended-release 
capsules and other CNS depressants can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, hypotension, and syncope.

ANSWER: Carbamazepine has been reported to be associated with hematological abnormalities, including aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The risk of 
developing these reactions is 5 to 8 times greater than in the general population, but the overall risk in the untreated general population is low. Transient or persistent decreased platelet or white 
blood cell counts are not uncommon with the use of carbamazepine, although the vast majority of cases of leukopenia have not progressed to more serious conditions. If a patient exhibits low or 
decreased white blood cell or platelet counts during treatment, close monitoring is advised, and discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression 
develops.

        Question: Does CARBAMAZEPINE increase or decrease the risk of bleeding?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether CARBAMAZEPINE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.
2. FDAHandler responded that Carbamazepine is associated with hematological abnormalities, including aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The risk of 
developing these reactions is 5 to 8 times greater than in the general population, although the overall risk in the untreated general population is low. Transient or persistent decreased platelet or 
white blood cell counts are not uncommon with the use of carbamazepine, which can also contribute to an increased risk of bleeding. Close monitoring is advised if low or decreased white blood cell or 
platelet counts are observed, and discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops.

        Final answer: CARBAMAZEPINE can increase the risk of bleeding due to its association with hematological abnormalities such as aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis, as well as its potential to 
cause decreased platelet or white blood cell counts.

CARBAMAZEPINE can increase the risk of bleeding due to its association with hematological abnormalities such as aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis, as well as its potential to cause decreased 
platelet or white blood cell counts. The risk of developing these reactions is 5 to 8 times greater than in the general population, although the overall risk in the untreated general population is 
low. Close monitoring is advised if low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts are observed, and discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow 
depression develops.
