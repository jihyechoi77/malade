CONTENT: DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with 
antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this 
occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests In venereal diseases when coexistent syphilis is suspected, darkfield examination should be done before treatment 
is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least 4 months. In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic, should be 
performed. All patients with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis. Patients treated with demeclocycline HCl should have a follow-up serologic test for syphilis 
after 3 months. DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may 
require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillins, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class 
drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. The concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has
been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and by iron-containing preparations. Carcinogenesis, 
Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of demeclocycline HCl have not been conducted. DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: However, 
there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the related antibiotics oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors) and minocycline (thyroid tumors). Although mutagenicity 
studies of demeclocycline HCl have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related 
antibiotics (tetracyclines HCl and oxytetracycline) (see WARNINGS and ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY ). Demeclocycline HCl had no effect on fertility when administered in the diet to male 
and female rats at a daily intake of 45 times the human dose. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS ). DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: Result of animal studies 
indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of 
embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Nonteratogenic effects (See WARNINGS ) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing 
Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue 
nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Not for use in patients younger than eight years of age .

has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be 
avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri. (See PRECAUTIONS . MINOCIN: drug_interactions: ) Increased risk of

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral doxycycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects of the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been 
infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Gastrointestinal: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, 
inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, and pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral 
administration of tetracyclines. Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition, reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported. Permanent tooth 
discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development. (See WARNINGS . DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ) Rare instances of 
esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of the drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately 
before going to bed. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, skin hyperpigmentation, maculopapular and erythematous rashes. 
Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Photosensitivity is discussed above. (See WARNINGS .) Renal toxicity: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related. (See 
WARNINGS . DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ) Immune: Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, 
exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction has been reported in the setting of spirochete 
infections treated with doxycycline. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Other: Bulging fontanels in infants and intracranial hypertension in 
adults. (See WARNINGS .) When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. No abnormalities of thyroid function
studies are known to occur.

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: WARNINGS The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause 
permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel
hypoplasia has also been reported. Use doxycycline in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening 
conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly 
all antibacterial agents, including doxycycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to 
overgrowth of C. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause 
increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following
the use of antibacterial drugs. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or 
confirmed, ongoing use of antibacterial drugs not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial 
treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema 
multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. (See ADVERSE 
REACTIONS .) If severe skin reactions occur, doxycycline should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been 
associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women
of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Concomitant use of isotretinoin and 
doxycycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual 
loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients 
should be monitored until they stabilize. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral 
tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are 
found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Evidence of embryotoxicity has also 
been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus. The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with
impaired renal function. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or 
ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.

CONTENT: DOXYCLYCLINE HYCLATE: indications_and_usage: Because many strains of the following groups of microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to doxycycline, culture and susceptibility testing 
are recommended. Doxycycline hyclate tablets are indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms, when bacteriological testing indicates appropriate 
susceptibility to the drug: • Escherichia coli • Enterobacter aerogenes • Shigella species • Acinetobacter species Urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. 1.5 Ophthalmic Infections 
Doxycycline hyclate tablets are indicated for treatment of the following ophthalmic infections: • Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated as 
judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . 1. DOXYCLYCLINE HYCLATE: indications_and_usage: 6 Anthrax Including Inhalational Anthrax (Post-Exposure) 
Doxycycline hyclate tablets are indicated for the treatment of Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis , including inhalational anthrax (post-exposure); to reduce the incidence or progression of disease 
following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis . 1.7 Alternative Treatment for Selected Infections when Penicillin is Contraindicated Doxycycline hyclate tablets are indicted as an alternative 
treatment for the following selected infections when penicillin is contraindicated: • Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum . • Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . • Listeriosis

In severe acne, doxycycline hyclate tablets may be useful adjunctive therapy. 1.9 Prophylaxis of Malaria Doxycycline hyclate tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria due to Plasmodium 
falciparum in short-term travelers (less than 4 months) to areas with chloroquine and/or pyrimethaminesulfadoxine resistant strains . 1. DOXYCLYCLINE HYCLATE: indications_and_usage: 10 Usage To reduce
the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline hyclate tablets and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline hyclate tablets should be used only to treat or 
prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or 
modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLATE HYCLATE: general_precautions: General As with other antibacterial drugs, use of Doxycycline Hyclate Capsules may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi.
If superinfection occurs, Doxycycline Hyclate Capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction 
with antibacterial therapy, when indicated. Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains. Doxycycline does not suppress P. falciparum 
’s sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas. Prescribing Doxycycline Hyclate Capsules in the 
absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant 
bacteria.

agent, including doxycycline, guarantees protection against malaria. to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using personal protective measures that help avoid contact with mosquitoes, especially from 
dusk to dawn (e.g., staying in well-screened areas, using mosquito nets, covering the body with clothing, and using an effective insect repellent). that doxycycline prophylaxis: o should begin 1 to 2 
days before travel to the malarious area, o should be continued daily while in the malarious area and after leaving the malarious area, o should be continued for 4 further weeks to avoid development 
of malaria after returning from an endemic area, o should not exceed 4 months. DOXYCYCLATE HYCLATE: information_for_patients: All patients taking doxycycline should be advised: to avoid excessive 
sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline and to discontinue therapy if phototoxicity (e.g., skin eruption, etc.) occurs. Sunscreen or sunblock should be considered (See 
WARNINGS ). to drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration (See ADVERSE REACTIONS ). that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when 
taken with foods, especially those which contain calcium. However, the absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk (See Drug Interactions ). that the
absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taking bismuth subsalicylate (See Drug Interactions ). that the use of doxycycline might increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy 
appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding. Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels 
achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs  . Instruct patients 
about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding  . 5.2 Tissue Necrosis Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues,
which is an uncommon but serious risk (<0.1%). WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin sodium 
therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported. Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine
whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin sodium 
therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.3 Calciphylaxis Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium uremic 
arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat calciphylaxis as 
appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. 5. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Acute Kidney Injury In patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of kidney disease, 
acute kidney injury may occur with warfarin sodium, possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria  . More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is advised in patients 
with compromised renal function. 5.5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic 
atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by 
the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as “purple toes syndrome. WARFARIN: 
warnings_and_cautions: Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.6 Limb Ischemia, Necrosis, 
and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS Do not use warfarin sodium as initial therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with 
thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). Cases of limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or 
continued. In some patients, sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and/or death. Treatment with warfarin sodium may be considered after the platelet count has normalized. 5.7 Use in 
Pregnant Women with Mechanical Heart Valves Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: While warfarin sodium is contraindicated during
pregnancy, the potential benefits of using warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the 
decision to initiate or continue warfarin sodium should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient’s medical 
situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and 
fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this 
drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus  . 5.
