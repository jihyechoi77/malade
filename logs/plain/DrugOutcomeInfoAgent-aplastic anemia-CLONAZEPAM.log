CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: using a standardized screening tool). Use of clonazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of 
clonazepam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other 
substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, 
evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to 
discontinue clonazepam tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam Tablets
) . CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those 
who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt 
discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can
be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ) . Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome 
with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ). CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Since clonazepam 
tablets produce CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor 
vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam tablets therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: 
Information for Patients ). Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs 
for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood
or behavior. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an
increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as
one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal
thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs
of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the
clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled 
Analysis Indication Placebo Drug Patients Relative Risk: Risk Difference: Patients with with Events Per Incidence of Additional Drug Events Per 1000 Patients Events in Drug Patients with 1000 Patients
Patients/Incidence Events per 1000 in Placebo Patients Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts
or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric 
indications. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Anyone considering prescribing clonazepam tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. 
Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal 
thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, 
their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the 
signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Do not suddenly stop taking clonazepam tablets. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual 
movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an extreme increase in activity
or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these symptoms. Some 
people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months , including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, 
problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears. 
Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not
take more clonazepam tablets than prescribed or take clonazepam tablets for longer than prescribed. Clonazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy and can slow your thinking and motor skills. This 
may get better over time. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how clonazepam tablets affect you. Clonazepam tablets may cause problems with your 
coordination, especially when you are walking or picking things up. Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking clonazepam tablets until you talk to your 
healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, clonazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Like other 
antiepileptic medicines, clonazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these 
symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic 
attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting on dangerous impulses new or worse irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) acting aggressive, being angry, or violent other unusual 
changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. 
Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: 
Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. Do not stop clonazepam tablets
without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause seizures that will not stop (status 
epilepticus). What are clonazepam tablets? Clonazepam tablets are a prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat: certain types of seizure disorders (epilepsy) in adults and 
children panic disorder with or without fear of open spaces (agoraphobia) in adults Clonazepam tablets are a federally controlled substance (C-IV) because it contains clonazepam that can be abused or 
lead to dependence. Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Selling or giving away clonazepam tablets may harm others, and is against the law. 
Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs. It is not known if clonazepam tablets are safe or effective in treating 
panic disorder in children younger than 18 years old. Who should not take clonazepam tablets? Do not take clonazepam tablets if you: are allergic to benzodiazepines have significant liver disease have
an eye disease called acute narrow angle glaucoma Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you have any of the problems listed above. Before you take clonazepam tablets, tell your 
healthcare provider if you: have liver or kidney problems have lung problems (respiratory disease) have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior have any other medical 
problems are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction: Inform patients that the use of clonazepam tablets, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, 
and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances . Inform patients about 
the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse,
Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Withdrawal Reactions: Inform patients that the continued use of clonazepam tablets may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and 
that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Inform 
patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that 
discontinuation or dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Interference With Cognitive and 
Motor Performance: Because benzodiazepines have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, 
until they are reasonably certain that clonazepam tablets therapy does not affect them adversely. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Suicidal Thinking and Behavior: Patients, their caregivers, and 
families should be counseled that AEDs, including clonazepam tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or 
worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers. Pregnancy: Advise pregnant females that use of clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or 
withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and 
PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Encourage patients to enroll in the North American 
Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant while taking clonazepam tablets. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy 
(see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Nursing: Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Instruct breastfeeding patients who take clonazepam 
tablets to monitor their infants for excessive sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ). Concomitant 
Medication: Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Alcohol:
Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking clonazepam tablets.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects 
on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the C max of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to 
when it was given alone. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and 
CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam
metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in 
clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the 
metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated concentrations and effects. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Pharmacodynamic Interactions: The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be
potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted 
with clonazepam. Mutagenesis The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Impairment of Fertility In a two-generation 
fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning. The 
lowest dose tested is approximately 5 and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a body surface area 
(mg/m 2 ) basis. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as clonazepam tablets, during pregnancy. 
Healthcare providers are encouraged to recommend that pregnant women taking clonazepam tablets enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or online at 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation 
and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome , and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to 
benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data). Administration of clonazepam to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted 
in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations, at doses similar to or below therapeutic doses in patients (see Animal Data). Data for other benzodiazepines suggest 
the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses. The background risk of major 
birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: using a standardized screening tool). Use of clonazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of 
clonazepam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other 
substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, 
evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to 
discontinue clonazepam tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam Tablets
) . CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those 
who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt 
discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can
be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ) . Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome 
with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ). CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Since clonazepam 
tablets produce CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor 
vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam tablets therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: 
Information for Patients ). Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs 
for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood
or behavior. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an
increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as
one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal
thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs
of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the
clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled 
Analysis Indication Placebo Drug Patients Relative Risk: Risk Difference: Patients with with Events Per Incidence of Additional Drug Events Per 1000 Patients Events in Drug Patients with 1000 Patients
Patients/Incidence Events per 1000 in Placebo Patients Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts
or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric 
indications. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Anyone considering prescribing clonazepam tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. 
Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal 
thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, 
their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the 
signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Do not suddenly stop taking clonazepam tablets. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual 
movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an extreme increase in activity
or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these symptoms. Some 
people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months , including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, 
problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears. 
Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not
take more clonazepam tablets than prescribed or take clonazepam tablets for longer than prescribed. Clonazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy and can slow your thinking and motor skills. This 
may get better over time. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how clonazepam tablets affect you. Clonazepam tablets may cause problems with your 
coordination, especially when you are walking or picking things up. Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking clonazepam tablets until you talk to your 
healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, clonazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Like other 
antiepileptic medicines, clonazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these 
symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic 
attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting on dangerous impulses new or worse irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) acting aggressive, being angry, or violent other unusual 
changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. 
Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: 
Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. Do not stop clonazepam tablets
without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause seizures that will not stop (status 
epilepticus). What are clonazepam tablets? Clonazepam tablets are a prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat: certain types of seizure disorders (epilepsy) in adults and 
children panic disorder with or without fear of open spaces (agoraphobia) in adults Clonazepam tablets are a federally controlled substance (C-IV) because it contains clonazepam that can be abused or 
lead to dependence. Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Selling or giving away clonazepam tablets may harm others, and is against the law. 
Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs. It is not known if clonazepam tablets are safe or effective in treating 
panic disorder in children younger than 18 years old. Who should not take clonazepam tablets? Do not take clonazepam tablets if you: are allergic to benzodiazepines have significant liver disease have
an eye disease called acute narrow angle glaucoma Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you have any of the problems listed above. Before you take clonazepam tablets, tell your 
healthcare provider if you: have liver or kidney problems have lung problems (respiratory disease) have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior have any other medical 
problems are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction: Inform patients that the use of clonazepam tablets, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, 
and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances . Inform patients about 
the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse,
Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Withdrawal Reactions: Inform patients that the continued use of clonazepam tablets may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and 
that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Inform 
patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that 
discontinuation or dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Interference With Cognitive and 
Motor Performance: Because benzodiazepines have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, 
until they are reasonably certain that clonazepam tablets therapy does not affect them adversely. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Suicidal Thinking and Behavior: Patients, their caregivers, and 
families should be counseled that AEDs, including clonazepam tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or 
worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers. Pregnancy: Advise pregnant females that use of clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or 
withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and 
PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Encourage patients to enroll in the North American 
Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant while taking clonazepam tablets. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy 
(see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Nursing: Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Instruct breastfeeding patients who take clonazepam 
tablets to monitor their infants for excessive sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ). Concomitant 
Medication: Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Alcohol:
Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking clonazepam tablets.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects 
on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the C max of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to 
when it was given alone. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and 
CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam
metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in 
clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the 
metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated concentrations and effects. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Pharmacodynamic Interactions: The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be
potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted 
with clonazepam. Mutagenesis The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Impairment of Fertility In a two-generation 
fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning. The 
lowest dose tested is approximately 5 and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a body surface area 
(mg/m 2 ) basis. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as clonazepam tablets, during pregnancy. 
Healthcare providers are encouraged to recommend that pregnant women taking clonazepam tablets enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or online at 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation 
and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome , and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to 
benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data). Administration of clonazepam to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted 
in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations, at doses similar to or below therapeutic doses in patients (see Animal Data). Data for other benzodiazepines suggest 
the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses. The background risk of major 
birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: using a standardized screening tool). Use of clonazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of 
clonazepam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other 
substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, 
evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to 
discontinue clonazepam tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam Tablets
) . CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those 
who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt 
discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can
be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ) . Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome 
with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ). CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Since clonazepam 
tablets produce CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor 
vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam tablets therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: 
Information for Patients ). Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs 
for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood
or behavior. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an
increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as
one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal
thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs
of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the
clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled 
Analysis Indication Placebo Drug Patients Relative Risk: Risk Difference: Patients with with Events Per Incidence of Additional Drug Events Per 1000 Patients Events in Drug Patients with 1000 Patients
Patients/Incidence Events per 1000 in Placebo Patients Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts
or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric 
indications. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Anyone considering prescribing clonazepam tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. 
Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal 
thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, 
their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the 
signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Do not suddenly stop taking clonazepam tablets. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual 
movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an extreme increase in activity
or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these symptoms. Some 
people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months , including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, 
problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears. 
Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not
take more clonazepam tablets than prescribed or take clonazepam tablets for longer than prescribed. Clonazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy and can slow your thinking and motor skills. This 
may get better over time. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how clonazepam tablets affect you. Clonazepam tablets may cause problems with your 
coordination, especially when you are walking or picking things up. Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking clonazepam tablets until you talk to your 
healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, clonazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Like other 
antiepileptic medicines, clonazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these 
symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic 
attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting on dangerous impulses new or worse irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) acting aggressive, being angry, or violent other unusual 
changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. 
Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: 
Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. Do not stop clonazepam tablets
without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause seizures that will not stop (status 
epilepticus). What are clonazepam tablets? Clonazepam tablets are a prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat: certain types of seizure disorders (epilepsy) in adults and 
children panic disorder with or without fear of open spaces (agoraphobia) in adults Clonazepam tablets are a federally controlled substance (C-IV) because it contains clonazepam that can be abused or 
lead to dependence. Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Selling or giving away clonazepam tablets may harm others, and is against the law. 
Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs. It is not known if clonazepam tablets are safe or effective in treating 
panic disorder in children younger than 18 years old. Who should not take clonazepam tablets? Do not take clonazepam tablets if you: are allergic to benzodiazepines have significant liver disease have
an eye disease called acute narrow angle glaucoma Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you have any of the problems listed above. Before you take clonazepam tablets, tell your 
healthcare provider if you: have liver or kidney problems have lung problems (respiratory disease) have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior have any other medical 
problems are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction: Inform patients that the use of clonazepam tablets, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, 
and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances . Inform patients about 
the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse,
Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Withdrawal Reactions: Inform patients that the continued use of clonazepam tablets may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and 
that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Inform 
patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that 
discontinuation or dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Interference With Cognitive and 
Motor Performance: Because benzodiazepines have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, 
until they are reasonably certain that clonazepam tablets therapy does not affect them adversely. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Suicidal Thinking and Behavior: Patients, their caregivers, and 
families should be counseled that AEDs, including clonazepam tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or 
worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers. Pregnancy: Advise pregnant females that use of clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or 
withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and 
PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Encourage patients to enroll in the North American 
Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant while taking clonazepam tablets. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy 
(see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Nursing: Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Instruct breastfeeding patients who take clonazepam 
tablets to monitor their infants for excessive sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ). Concomitant 
Medication: Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Alcohol:
Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking clonazepam tablets.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects 
on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the C max of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to 
when it was given alone. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and 
CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam
metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in 
clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the 
metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated concentrations and effects. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Pharmacodynamic Interactions: The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be
potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted 
with clonazepam. Mutagenesis The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Impairment of Fertility In a two-generation 
fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning. The 
lowest dose tested is approximately 5 and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a body surface area 
(mg/m 2 ) basis. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as clonazepam tablets, during pregnancy. 
Healthcare providers are encouraged to recommend that pregnant women taking clonazepam tablets enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or online at 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation 
and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome , and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to 
benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data). Administration of clonazepam to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted 
in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations, at doses similar to or below therapeutic doses in patients (see Animal Data). Data for other benzodiazepines suggest 
the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses. The background risk of major 
birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: using a standardized screening tool). Use of clonazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of 
clonazepam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other 
substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, 
evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to 
discontinue clonazepam tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam Tablets
) . CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those 
who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt 
discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can
be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ) . Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome 
with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ). CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Since clonazepam 
tablets produce CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor 
vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam tablets therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: 
Information for Patients ). Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs 
for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood
or behavior. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an
increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as
one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal
thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs
of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the
clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled 
Analysis Indication Placebo Drug Patients Relative Risk: Risk Difference: Patients with with Events Per Incidence of Additional Drug Events Per 1000 Patients Events in Drug Patients with 1000 Patients
Patients/Incidence Events per 1000 in Placebo Patients Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts
or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric 
indications. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Anyone considering prescribing clonazepam tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. 
Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal 
thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, 
their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the 
signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Do not suddenly stop taking clonazepam tablets. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual 
movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an extreme increase in activity
or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these symptoms. Some 
people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months , including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, 
problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears. 
Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not
take more clonazepam tablets than prescribed or take clonazepam tablets for longer than prescribed. Clonazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy and can slow your thinking and motor skills. This 
may get better over time. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how clonazepam tablets affect you. Clonazepam tablets may cause problems with your 
coordination, especially when you are walking or picking things up. Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking clonazepam tablets until you talk to your 
healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, clonazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Like other 
antiepileptic medicines, clonazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these 
symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic 
attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting on dangerous impulses new or worse irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) acting aggressive, being angry, or violent other unusual 
changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. 
Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: 
Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. Do not stop clonazepam tablets
without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause seizures that will not stop (status 
epilepticus). What are clonazepam tablets? Clonazepam tablets are a prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat: certain types of seizure disorders (epilepsy) in adults and 
children panic disorder with or without fear of open spaces (agoraphobia) in adults Clonazepam tablets are a federally controlled substance (C-IV) because it contains clonazepam that can be abused or 
lead to dependence. Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Selling or giving away clonazepam tablets may harm others, and is against the law. 
Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs. It is not known if clonazepam tablets are safe or effective in treating 
panic disorder in children younger than 18 years old. Who should not take clonazepam tablets? Do not take clonazepam tablets if you: are allergic to benzodiazepines have significant liver disease have
an eye disease called acute narrow angle glaucoma Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you have any of the problems listed above. Before you take clonazepam tablets, tell your 
healthcare provider if you: have liver or kidney problems have lung problems (respiratory disease) have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior have any other medical 
problems are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction: Inform patients that the use of clonazepam tablets, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, 
and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances . Inform patients about 
the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse,
Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Withdrawal Reactions: Inform patients that the continued use of clonazepam tablets may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and 
that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Inform 
patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that 
discontinuation or dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Interference With Cognitive and 
Motor Performance: Because benzodiazepines have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, 
until they are reasonably certain that clonazepam tablets therapy does not affect them adversely. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Suicidal Thinking and Behavior: Patients, their caregivers, and 
families should be counseled that AEDs, including clonazepam tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or 
worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers. Pregnancy: Advise pregnant females that use of clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or 
withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and 
PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Encourage patients to enroll in the North American 
Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant while taking clonazepam tablets. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy 
(see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Nursing: Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Instruct breastfeeding patients who take clonazepam 
tablets to monitor their infants for excessive sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ). Concomitant 
Medication: Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Alcohol:
Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking clonazepam tablets.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects 
on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the C max of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to 
when it was given alone. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and 
CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam
metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in 
clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the 
metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated concentrations and effects. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Pharmacodynamic Interactions: The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be
potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted 
with clonazepam. Mutagenesis The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Impairment of Fertility In a two-generation 
fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning. The 
lowest dose tested is approximately 5 and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a body surface area 
(mg/m 2 ) basis. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as clonazepam tablets, during pregnancy. 
Healthcare providers are encouraged to recommend that pregnant women taking clonazepam tablets enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or online at 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation 
and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome , and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to 
benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data). Administration of clonazepam to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted 
in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations, at doses similar to or below therapeutic doses in patients (see Animal Data). Data for other benzodiazepines suggest 
the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses. The background risk of major 
birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: using a standardized screening tool). Use of clonazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of 
clonazepam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other 
substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, 
evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to 
discontinue clonazepam tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam Tablets
) . CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those 
who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt 
discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can
be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ) . Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome 
with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ). CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Since clonazepam 
tablets produce CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor 
vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam tablets therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: 
Information for Patients ). Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs 
for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood
or behavior. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an
increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as
one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal
thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs
of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the
clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled 
Analysis Indication Placebo Drug Patients Relative Risk: Risk Difference: Patients with with Events Per Incidence of Additional Drug Events Per 1000 Patients Events in Drug Patients with 1000 Patients
Patients/Incidence Events per 1000 in Placebo Patients Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts
or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric 
indications. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Anyone considering prescribing clonazepam tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. 
Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal 
thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, 
their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the 
signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Do not suddenly stop taking clonazepam tablets. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual 
movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an extreme increase in activity
or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these symptoms. Some 
people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months , including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, 
problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears. 
Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not
take more clonazepam tablets than prescribed or take clonazepam tablets for longer than prescribed. Clonazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy and can slow your thinking and motor skills. This 
may get better over time. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how clonazepam tablets affect you. Clonazepam tablets may cause problems with your 
coordination, especially when you are walking or picking things up. Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking clonazepam tablets until you talk to your 
healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, clonazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Like other 
antiepileptic medicines, clonazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these 
symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic 
attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting on dangerous impulses new or worse irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) acting aggressive, being angry, or violent other unusual 
changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. 
Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: 
Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. Do not stop clonazepam tablets
without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause seizures that will not stop (status 
epilepticus). What are clonazepam tablets? Clonazepam tablets are a prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat: certain types of seizure disorders (epilepsy) in adults and 
children panic disorder with or without fear of open spaces (agoraphobia) in adults Clonazepam tablets are a federally controlled substance (C-IV) because it contains clonazepam that can be abused or 
lead to dependence. Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Selling or giving away clonazepam tablets may harm others, and is against the law. 
Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs. It is not known if clonazepam tablets are safe or effective in treating 
panic disorder in children younger than 18 years old. Who should not take clonazepam tablets? Do not take clonazepam tablets if you: are allergic to benzodiazepines have significant liver disease have
an eye disease called acute narrow angle glaucoma Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you have any of the problems listed above. Before you take clonazepam tablets, tell your 
healthcare provider if you: have liver or kidney problems have lung problems (respiratory disease) have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior have any other medical 
problems are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction: Inform patients that the use of clonazepam tablets, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, 
and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances . Inform patients about 
the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse,
Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Withdrawal Reactions: Inform patients that the continued use of clonazepam tablets may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and 
that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Inform 
patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that 
discontinuation or dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Interference With Cognitive and 
Motor Performance: Because benzodiazepines have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, 
until they are reasonably certain that clonazepam tablets therapy does not affect them adversely. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Suicidal Thinking and Behavior: Patients, their caregivers, and 
families should be counseled that AEDs, including clonazepam tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or 
worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers. Pregnancy: Advise pregnant females that use of clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or 
withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and 
PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Encourage patients to enroll in the North American 
Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant while taking clonazepam tablets. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy 
(see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Nursing: Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Instruct breastfeeding patients who take clonazepam 
tablets to monitor their infants for excessive sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ). Concomitant 
Medication: Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Alcohol:
Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking clonazepam tablets.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects 
on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the C max of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to 
when it was given alone. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and 
CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam
metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in 
clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the 
metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated concentrations and effects. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Pharmacodynamic Interactions: The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be
potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted 
with clonazepam. Mutagenesis The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Impairment of Fertility In a two-generation 
fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning. The 
lowest dose tested is approximately 5 and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a body surface area 
(mg/m 2 ) basis. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as clonazepam tablets, during pregnancy. 
Healthcare providers are encouraged to recommend that pregnant women taking clonazepam tablets enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or online at 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation 
and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome , and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to 
benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data). Administration of clonazepam to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted 
in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations, at doses similar to or below therapeutic doses in patients (see Animal Data). Data for other benzodiazepines suggest 
the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses. The background risk of major 
birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: using a standardized screening tool). Use of clonazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of 
clonazepam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other 
substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, 
evaluate the patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to 
discontinue clonazepam tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam Tablets
) . CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and those 
who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. Abrupt 
discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can
be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ) . Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome 
with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ). CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Since clonazepam 
tablets produce CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving a motor 
vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam tablets therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: 
Information for Patients ). Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs 
for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood
or behavior. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an
increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as
one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal
thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs
of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the
clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled 
Analysis Indication Placebo Drug Patients Relative Risk: Risk Difference: Patients with with Events Per Incidence of Additional Drug Events Per 1000 Patients Events in Drug Patients with 1000 Patients
Patients/Incidence Events per 1000 in Placebo Patients Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts
or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric 
indications. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Anyone considering prescribing clonazepam tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. 
Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal 
thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, 
their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the 
signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Do not suddenly stop taking clonazepam tablets. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious and life-threatening side effects, including, unusual 
movements, responses, or expressions, seizures, sudden and severe mental or nervous system changes, depression, seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear, an extreme increase in activity
or talking, losing touch with reality, and suicidal thoughts or actions. Call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you get any of these symptoms. Some 
people who suddenly stop benzodiazepines have symptoms that can last for several weeks to more than 12 months , including, anxiety, trouble remembering, learning, or concentrating, depression, 
problems sleeping, feeling like insects are crawling under your skin, weakness, shaking, muscle twitching, burning or prickling feeling in your hands, arms, legs or feet, and ringing in your ears. 
Physical dependence is not the same as drug addiction. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Your healthcare provider can tell you more about the differences between physical dependence and drug addiction. Do not
take more clonazepam tablets than prescribed or take clonazepam tablets for longer than prescribed. Clonazepam tablets can make you sleepy or dizzy and can slow your thinking and motor skills. This 
may get better over time. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how clonazepam tablets affect you. Clonazepam tablets may cause problems with your 
coordination, especially when you are walking or picking things up. Do not drink alcohol or take other drugs that may make you sleepy or dizzy while taking clonazepam tablets until you talk to your 
healthcare provider. When taken with alcohol or drugs that cause sleepiness or dizziness, clonazepam tablets may make your sleepiness or dizziness worse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Like other 
antiepileptic medicines, clonazepam tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these 
symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic 
attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) acting on dangerous impulses new or worse irritability an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) acting aggressive, being angry, or violent other unusual 
changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. 
Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: 
Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. Do not stop clonazepam tablets
without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping clonazepam tablets suddenly can cause seizures that will not stop (status 
epilepticus). What are clonazepam tablets? Clonazepam tablets are a prescription medicine used alone or with other medicines to treat: certain types of seizure disorders (epilepsy) in adults and 
children panic disorder with or without fear of open spaces (agoraphobia) in adults Clonazepam tablets are a federally controlled substance (C-IV) because it contains clonazepam that can be abused or 
lead to dependence. Keep clonazepam tablets in a safe place to prevent misuse and abuse. CLONAZEPAM: spl_medguide: Selling or giving away clonazepam tablets may harm others, and is against the law. 
Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever abused or been dependent on alcohol, prescription medicines, or street drugs. It is not known if clonazepam tablets are safe or effective in treating 
panic disorder in children younger than 18 years old. Who should not take clonazepam tablets? Do not take clonazepam tablets if you: are allergic to benzodiazepines have significant liver disease have
an eye disease called acute narrow angle glaucoma Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you have any of the problems listed above. Before you take clonazepam tablets, tell your 
healthcare provider if you: have liver or kidney problems have lung problems (respiratory disease) have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior have any other medical 
problems are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction: Inform patients that the use of clonazepam tablets, even at recommended dosages, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, 
and addiction, which can lead to overdose and death, especially when used in combination with other medications (e.g., opioid analgesics), alcohol, and/or illicit substances . Inform patients about 
the signs and symptoms of benzodiazepine abuse, misuse, and addiction; to seek medical help if they develop these signs and/or symptoms; and on the proper disposal of unused drug (see WARNINGS: Abuse,
Misuse, and Addiction and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Withdrawal Reactions: Inform patients that the continued use of clonazepam tablets may lead to clinically significant physical dependence and 
that abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Inform 
patients that in some cases, patients taking benzodiazepines have developed a protracted withdrawal syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months. Instruct patients that 
discontinuation or dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets may require a slow taper (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) . Interference With Cognitive and 
Motor Performance: Because benzodiazepines have the potential to impair judgment, thinking or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, 
until they are reasonably certain that clonazepam tablets therapy does not affect them adversely. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Suicidal Thinking and Behavior: Patients, their caregivers, and 
families should be counseled that AEDs, including clonazepam tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or 
worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported 
immediately to healthcare providers. Pregnancy: Advise pregnant females that use of clonazepam tablets late in pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression, lethargy, hypotonia) and/or 
withdrawal symptoms (hyperreflexia, irritability, restlessness, tremors, inconsolable crying, and feeding difficulties) in newborns (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and 
PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are pregnant. CLONAZEPAM: information_for_patients: Encourage patients to enroll in the North American 
Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant while taking clonazepam tablets. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy 
(see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy ). Nursing: Instruct patients to inform their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Instruct breastfeeding patients who take clonazepam 
tablets to monitor their infants for excessive sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ). Concomitant 
Medication: Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Alcohol:
Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking clonazepam tablets.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects 
on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the C max of clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to 
when it was given alone. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and 
CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam
metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in 
clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the 
metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated concentrations and effects. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Pharmacodynamic Interactions: The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be
potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted 
with clonazepam. Mutagenesis The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic potential of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Impairment of Fertility In a two-generation 
fertility study in which clonazepam was given orally to rats at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day, there was a decrease in the number of pregnancies and in the number of offspring surviving until weaning. The 
lowest dose tested is approximately 5 and 24 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a body surface area 
(mg/m 2 ) basis. Pregnancy: Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to AEDs, such as clonazepam tablets, during pregnancy. 
Healthcare providers are encouraged to recommend that pregnant women taking clonazepam tablets enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 or online at 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation 
and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome , and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to 
benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data). Administration of clonazepam to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted 
in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations, at doses similar to or below therapeutic doses in patients (see Animal Data). Data for other benzodiazepines suggest 
the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses. The background risk of major 
birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

The question was whether CLONAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. I attempted to consult FDAHandler for information regarding the effects of CLONAZEPAM on the risk of aplastic 
anemia. However, due to a technical issue, I did not receive any response from FDAHandler. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on FDA label data, and my final answer is DO-NOT-KNOW.
