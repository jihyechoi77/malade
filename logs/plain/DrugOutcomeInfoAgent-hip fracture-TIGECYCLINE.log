CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Tigecycline for injection, like other tetracycline class antibacterial drugs, may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth and 
reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy  . There are no available data on the risk of major birth defects or miscarriage following 
the use of tigecycline for injection during pregnancy. Administration of intravenous tigecycline in pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was associated with reduction in fetal 
weights and an increased incidence of skeletal anomalies (delays in bone ossification) at exposures of 5 and 1 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose in rats and rabbits, 
respectively. TIGECYCLINE: pregnancy: Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if tigecycline for injection is used during the second or third trimester. The estimated background risk of 
major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U. S. general population, 
the estimated background risk in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data The use of tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs, that includes tigecycline 
for injection, during tooth development (second and third trimester of pregnancy) may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth. This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of 
tetracyclines but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Tigecycline for injection may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third 
trimesters of pregnancy. TIGECYCLINE: pregnancy: A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. Animal Data In 
embryo-fetal development studies, tigecycline was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 12 mg/kg/day in rats and 4 mg/kg in rabbits or 5 and 1 times the systemic exposure at 
the recommended clinical dose, respectively. In the rat study, decreased fetal weight and fetal skeletal variations (reduced ossification of the pubic, ischial, and supraoccipital bones and increased 
incidences of rudimentary 14 th rib) were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at 12 mg/kg/day (5 times the recommended clinical dose based on systemic exposure). In rabbits, decreased fetal 
weights were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at 4 mg/kg (equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose). TIGECYCLINE: pregnancy: In preclinical safety studies, 14 
C-labeled tigecycline crossed the placenta and was found in fetal tissues.

        Do one of the following:

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.
            DO NOT REPEAT your original message; ONLY specify the 
            `intended_recipient` via this tool/function-call.
        2. If you are ready to have the critic check your answer,
            do so with the `final_answer` tool/function, as I have requested.
        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
        else to say, you MUST EXIT IMMEDIATELY by stating that you are done
        with the usual code (as in #3).

The question was whether TIGECYCLINE increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. I sent a query to FDAHandler to obtain information on this matter, but I have not received a response that would 
provide the necessary data to answer the question. Without specific information from the FDA label, I cannot provide a reliable answer. Therefore, the final answer is DO-NOT-KNOW.
