                Passages:
                1. Drug DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE has been reported to rarely increase the risk of acute liver injury. This information comes from the FDA label for Doxycycline Hyclate,
which indicates that hepatotoxicity, including acute liver injury, has been reported rarely with its use. The adverse reactions have occurred with both oral and parenteral administration of 
tetracyclines, a category that includes Doxycycline Hyclate.
2. Drug TIGECYCLINE: TIGECYCLINE can increase the risk of acute liver injury. This is supported by the response from FDAHandler, which indicates that hepatic adverse effects, including increases in 
total bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time, and transaminases, have been reported in patients treated with tigecycline. Additionally, isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic
failure have been reported, although it is noted that some of these patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Monitoring for worsening hepatic function is recommended for patients who 
develop abnormal liver function tests during tigecycline therapy.
3. Drug MINOCYCLINE: MINOCYCLINE has been associated with an increased risk of acute liver injury. This includes reports of serious liver injury, irreversible drug-induced hepatitis, and fulminant 
hepatic failure, some of which have been fatal, as confirmed by FDAHandler referencing the MINOCYCLINE label.

                Does the tetracycline category of drugs increase the risk of
                acute liver injury, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the tetracycline category of drugs increase the risk of acute liver injury, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. All three drugs mentioned (Doxycycline Hyclate, Tigecycline, and Minocycline) belong to the tetracycline category.
2. Each drug has been reported to increase the risk of acute liver injury, as indicated by their respective FDA labels and reports.
3. Doxycycline Hyclate has been reported to rarely increase the risk of acute liver injury.
4. Tigecycline has been reported to increase the risk of acute liver injury, with hepatic adverse effects noted in patients treated with the drug.
5. Minocycline has been associated with an increased risk of acute liver injury, including serious liver injury and fatal outcomes.
6. Given that all three drugs in the tetracycline category have been reported to increase the risk of acute liver injury, it can be concluded that the tetracycline category of drugs as a whole 
increases the risk of acute liver injury.
        -----
        Final answer: The tetracycline category of drugs increases the risk of acute liver injury.
