                1. Drug ALENDRONATE SODIUM: Alendronate sodium does not appear to directly increase or decrease the risk of renal failure according to the FDA label. However, it is not recommended for
patients with severely impaired renal function (creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min) due to lack of experience with the drug in such cases. For patients with mild to moderate renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min), no dosage adjustment is necessary.
2. Drug ALENDRONATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ALENDRONATE does not directly address whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. The label does mention that in preclinical studies with rats, there was an 
increased accumulation of alendronate in the presence of renal failure, which suggests that elimination of the drug is reduced in patients with impaired renal function. The label advises caution when 
using alendronate in patients with existing renal impairment and does not recommend its use for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with alendronate in 
renal failure. However, this information does not provide direct evidence regarding the risk of renal failure in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, we cannot determine from the FDA label 
whether alendronate increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.

                Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of
                renal failure, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of renal failure, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that alendronate sodium does not appear to directly increase or decrease the risk of renal failure according to the FDA label.
2. Passage 1 also mentions that alendronate sodium is not recommended for patients with severely impaired renal function, but this is due to a lack of experience with the drug in such cases, not 
because of a known increased risk.
3. Passage 2 states that the FDA label for alendronate does not directly address whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
4. Passage 2 also notes that there is an increased accumulation of alendronate in rats with renal failure, suggesting reduced elimination in patients with impaired renal function. However, this does 
not provide direct evidence regarding the risk of renal failure in patients with normal renal function.
5. Based on the information provided, there is no clear evidence that alendronate or alendronate sodium increases or decreases the risk of renal failure in patients with normal renal function.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the alendronate category of drugs on the risk of renal failure.
