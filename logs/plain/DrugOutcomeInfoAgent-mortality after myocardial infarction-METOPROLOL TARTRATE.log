CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Metoprolol tartrate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. They may be used alone or in 
combination with other antihypertensive agents. Angina Pectoris Metoprolol tartrate tablets, USP are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris. Myocardial Infarction Metoprolol tartrate 
tablets, USP are indicated in the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality when used alone or in 
conjunction with intravenous metoprolol. Oral metoprolol tartrate tablets, USP therapy can be initiated after intravenous metoprolol therapy or, alternatively, oral treatment can begin within 3 to 10 
days of the acute event (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and WARNINGS ).

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: warnings: WARNINGS Heart Failure Beta blockers, like metoprolol, can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock.
If signs or symptoms of heart failure develop, treat the patient according to recommended guidelines. It may be necessary to lower the dose of metoprolol or to discontinue it. Ischemic Heart Disease 
Do not abruptly discontinue metoprolol therapy in patients with coronary artery disease. Severe exacerbation of angina, myocardial infarction and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported in patients
with coronary artery disease following the abrupt discontinuation of therapy with beta-blockers. When discontinuing chronically administered metoprolol, particularly in patients with coronary artery 
disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: warnings: If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary
insufficiency develops, metoprolol administration should be reinstated promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients 
should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician’s advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to 
discontinue metoprolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension. Use During Major Surgery Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior 
to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures. Bradycardia Bradycardia, 
including sinus pause, heart block, and cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of metoprolol. Patients with first-degree atrioventricular block, sinus node dysfunction, or conduction disorders may 
be at increased risk. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: warnings: Monitor heart rate and rhythm in patients receiving metoprolol. If severe bradycardia develops, reduce or stop metoprolol. Exacerbation of 
Bronchospastic Disease Patients with bronchospastic disease, should, in general, not receive beta blockers, including metoprolol. Because of its relative beta 1 selectivity, however, metoprolol may be
used in patients with bronchospastic disease who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, other antihypertensive treatment. Because beta 1 selectivity is not absolute use the lowest possible dose of 
metoprolol and consider administering metoprolol in smaller doses three times daily, instead of larger doses two times daily, to avoid the higher plasma levels associated with the longer dosing 
interval (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Bronchodilators, including beta 2 agonists, should be readily available or administered concomitantly.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Renal Impairment The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree 
from those in normal subjects. Hepatic Impairment Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. The elimination 
half-life of metoprolol is considerably prolonged, depending on severity (up to 7.2 h). Clinical Studies Hypertension In controlled clinical studies, metoprolol has been shown to be an effective 
antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics, at dosages of 100 to 450 mg daily. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: In controlled, comparative, 
clinical studies, metoprolol has been shown to be as effective an antihypertensive agent as propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, to be equally effective in supine and standing 
positions. Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials, metoprolol, administered two or four times daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks 
and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. A controlled, comparative, clinical trial showed that metoprolol was indistinguishable from 
propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Myocardial Infarction In a large (1,395 patients randomized), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, 
metoprolol was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in 
the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of
shock, and/or more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of metoprolol or placebo, given in a 
coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with metoprolol or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After this double-blind period, all patients were given metoprolol and followed 
up to 1 year. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the metoprolol- and placebo-treatment groups. Among 
patients treated with metoprolol, there were comparable reductions in 3-month mortality for those treated early (≤8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the 
incidence of ventricular fibrillation and in chest pain following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with metoprolol and were independent of the interval between onset of symptoms and 
initiation of therapy. In this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both very early (intra-venously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while placebo patients received no 
beta-blocker treatment for this period. The study thus was able to show a benefit from the overall metoprolol regimen but cannot separate the benefit of very early intravenous treatment from the 
benefit of later beta-blocker therapy. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Nonetheless, because the overall regimen showed a clear beneficial effect on survival without evidence of an early adverse
effect on survival, one acceptable dosage regimen is the precise regimen used in the trial. Because the specific benefit of very early treatment remains to be defined however, it is also reasonable to
administer the drug orally to patients at a later time as is recommended for certain other beta-blockers.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Individualized the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken 
with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. Increase the dosage 
at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective 
dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: While once-daily dosing is 
effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period, and larger or more 
frequent daily doses may be required. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the
day. Beta 1 selectivity diminishes as the dose of metoprolol is increased. Angina Pectoris The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be 
taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until 
optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is pronounced slowing of the heart rate. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets 
is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, gradually decrease the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks (see WARNINGS ). 
Myocardial Infarction Early Treatment During the early phase of definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, initiate treatment with metoprolol tartrate tablets as soon as possible after the 
patient's arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient’s hemodynamic condition has stabilized. Begin treatment in this 
early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; give the injections at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous 
administration of metoprolol, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), 
initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose and continue for 48 hours. Thereafter, the maintenance dosage is 100 mg twice daily (see Late 
Treatment below). Start patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose on metoprolol tartrate tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 
minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition allows. In patients with severe intolerance, discontinue metoprolol tartrate tablets (see WARNINGS ). METOPROLOL 
TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: Late Treatment Start patients with contraindications to treatment during the early phase of suspected or definite myocardial infarction, patients who appear not to
tolerate the full early treatment, and patients in whom the physician wishes to delay therapy for any other reason on metoprolol tartrate tablets, 100 mg twice daily, as soon as their clinical 
condition allows. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest 
that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years. Special Populations Pediatric Patients : No pediatric studies have been performed. The safety and efficacy of metoprolol tartrate tablets in 
pediatric patients have not been established. Renal Impairment : No dose adjustment of metoprolol tartrate tablets is required in patients with renal impairment. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: 
dosage_and_administration: Hepatic Impairment : Metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, metoprolol tartrate tablets should be 
initiated at low doses with cautious gradual dose titration according to clinical response. Geriatric Patients (>65 years) : In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their
greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Method of Administration For oral treatment, the tablets should be swallowed 
un-chewed with a glass of water. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should always be taken in standardized relation with meals. If the physician asks the patient to take metoprolol tartrate tablets either 
before breakfast or with breakfast, then the patient should continue taking metoprolol with the same schedule during the course of therapy.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pregnancy: Pregnancy Category C Upon confirming the diagnosis of pregnancy, women should immediately inform the doctor. Metoprolol has been shown to increase 
postimplantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at doses up to 11 times the maximum daily human dose of 450 mg, when based on surface area. Distribution studies in mice confirm exposure 
of the fetus when metoprolol is administered to the pregnant animal. These limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to teratogenicity (see Carcinogenesis,
Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The amount of data on the use of metoprolol in pregnant women is limited. The risk to the 
fetus/mother is unknown. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

METOPROLOL TARTRATE decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. This conclusion is based on a large clinical study cited by the FDA, which showed that metoprolol reduced 3-month 
mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction. Patients in the study received metoprolol both very early (intravenously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while 
the placebo group did not receive any beta-blocker treatment during this time.
