CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or 
below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks 
of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions,
careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may
be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status 
epilepticus. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, 
this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should 
be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis 
(TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the 
first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. PHENYTOIN:
warnings_and_cautions: If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  . Studies in patients of Chinese 
ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited
evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. 
PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in 
carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to 
carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers  . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate 
clinical vigilance and patient management. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) 
dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan 
Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including 
phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with 
other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. 
PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of 
hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium
Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who 
have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity  . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and 
oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in 
the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported 
with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, 
leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be 
immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in 
association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have 
been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, 
and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of 
lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS . PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation 
for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue 
irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as 
“purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The 
syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as 
fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered 
directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each 
injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the 
solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic 
Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum 
levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be 
exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies 
of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit 
hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other 
antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of 
vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and 
to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also 
raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states 
referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels 
should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.         
SOURCE:PHENYTOIN label


CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to 
sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when 
possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin 
at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations 
may increase modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50
mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered
intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the 
slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms . Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. 
Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form 
over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt 
and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those
with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly 
patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required . 2. PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: 7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy 
because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted
as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels 
should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin 
within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: The drug should be injected
slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: adverse_reactions: The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in
pediatric patients  . Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS  have been observed. Anaphylaxis has 
also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe 
cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. PHENYTOIN: adverse_reactions: Severe complications are most 
commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients  . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure  , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and 
gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin  . These have included 
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions 
usually respond to folic acid therapy. PHENYTOIN: adverse_reactions: Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease have been reported . 
Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in 
the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose , alkaline
phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. 
PHENYTOIN: adverse_reactions: Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor 
twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those 
induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use  . A 
predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Sk in and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever 
have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. PHENYTOIN: adverse_reactions: A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more 
serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis  . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. 
Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin  . Sp ec ial Senses: Altered taste sensation including 
metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie’s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and 
mental confusion.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.
2. FDAHandler responded that PHENYTOIN has been associated with hematopoietic complications, some of which have been fatal, including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, 
and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression.
3. Aplastic anemia is a condition where bone marrow does not produce sufficient new cells to replenish blood cells. The mention of pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression in the context 
of PHENYTOIN's side effects suggests an increased risk of aplastic anemia, as pancytopenia can be a manifestation of aplastic anemia.

The question was whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. I consulted FDAHandler, and the response indicated that PHENYTOIN has been associated with hematopoietic 
complications, some of which have been fatal, including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. Aplastic anemia is a 
condition where the bone marrow fails to produce sufficient new cells to replenish blood cells, and pancytopenia can be a manifestation of aplastic anemia. Therefore, the information suggests that 
PHENYTOIN increases the risk of aplastic anemia.
