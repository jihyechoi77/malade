CONTENT: ABELCET: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate patients), 
of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 patients were 
treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with ABELCET ® , 9% 
discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient chills and/or fever 
during infusion of the drug. ABELCET: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14 Increased Serum Creatinine 11

CONTENT: ABELCET: pediatric_use: Pediatric Use: One hundred eleven children (2 were enrolled twice and counted as separate patients), age 16 years and under, of whom 11 were less than 1 year, have 
been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, prospective, single-arm study. In one single-center study, 5 children with hepatosplenic candidiasis were 
effectively treated with 2.5 mg/kg/day of ABELCET ® . No serious unexpected adverse events have been reported.         
SOURCE:ABELCET label


CONTENT: ABELCET: precautions: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ABELCET ® . The 
following in vitro (with and without metabolic activation) and in vivo studies to assess ABELCET ® for mutagenic potential were conducted: bacterial reverse mutation assay, mouse lymphoma forward 
mutation assay, chromosomal aberration assay in CHO cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. ABELCET ® was found to be without mutagenic effects in all assay systems. Studies demonstrated that 
ABELCET ® had no impact on fertility in male and female rats at doses up to 0.32 times the recommended human dose (based on body surface area considerations). Pregnancy: There are no reports of 
pregnant women having been treated with ABELCET ® . Teratogenic Effects. ABELCET: precautions: Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits at doses of ABELCET ® up to 0.64 times the human dose revealed 
no harm to the fetus. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, and adequate and well-controlled studies have not been conducted in pregnant women, ABELCET ® 
should be used during pregnancy only after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether ABELCET ® is excreted in human milk. Because many 
drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants from ABELCET ® , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to 
discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. ABELCET: precautions: Pediatric Use: One hundred eleven children (2 were enrolled twice and counted as separate 
patients), age 16 years and under, of whom 11 were less than 1 year, have been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, prospective, single-arm study. In one 
single-center study, 5 children with hepatosplenic candidiasis were effectively treated with 2.5 mg/kg/day of ABELCET ® . No serious unexpected adverse events have been reported. Geriatric Use: 
Forty-nine elderly patients, age 65 years or over, have been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, prospective, single-arm study. No serious unexpected adverse
events have been reported.

ANSWER: The available information from the ABELCET label does not directly address whether ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. The label provides details about adverse 
reactions observed in patients treated with ABELCET, including the percentage of patients who experienced various adverse events. It is mentioned that 9% of patients discontinued treatment due to 
adverse events, but there is no specific mention of hospitalization risk.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that the ABELCET label does not directly address whether ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. The label provides details about adverse reactions observed
in patients treated with ABELCET, including the percentage of patients who experienced various adverse events. It is mentioned that 9% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events, but 
there is no specific mention of hospitalization risk.

The FDA label for ABELCET does not directly address whether ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. The label provides details about adverse reactions observed in patients treated 
with ABELCET, including the percentage of patients who experienced various adverse events. It is mentioned that 9% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events, but there is no specific 
mention of hospitalization risk. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine the impact of ABELCET on hospitalization risk.
