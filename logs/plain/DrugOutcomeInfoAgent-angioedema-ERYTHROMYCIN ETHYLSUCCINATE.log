CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ery-Ped should only be used to treat bacterial 
infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Ery-Ped is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better 
early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate 
treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ery-Ped or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by 
antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps 
and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: information_for_patients: If this occurs, patients should contact their 
physician as soon as possible.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent side effects of oral erythromycin preparations are gastrointestinal and are dose-related. They include 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and anorexia. Symptoms of hepatitis, hepatic dysfunction and/or abnormal liver function test results may occur. (See WARNINGS section.) Onset of 
pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment. (See WARNINGS .) Erythromycin has been associated with QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including 
ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes. (See WARNINGS .) Allergic reactions ranging from urticaria to anaphylaxis have occurred. Skin reactions ranging from mild eruptions to erythema 
multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported rarely. There have been reports of interstitial nephritis coincident with erythromycin use. ERYTHROMYCIN 
ETHYLSUCCINATE: adverse_reactions: There have been rare reports of pancreatitis and convulsions. There have been isolated reports of reversible hearing loss occurring chiefly in patients with renal 
insufficiency and in patients receiving high doses of erythromycin.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Orally administered erythromycin ethylsuccinate suspension is readily and reliably absorbed under both fasting and 
nonfasting conditions. Erythromycin diffuses readily into most body fluids. Only low concentrations are normally achieved in the spinal fluid, but passage of the drug across the blood-brain barrier 
increases in meningitis. In the presence of normal hepatic function, erythromycin is concentrated in the liver and excreted in the bile; the effect of hepatic dysfunction on excretion of erythromycin 
by the liver into the bile is not known. Less than 5 percent of the orally administered dose of erythromycin is excreted in active form in the urine. Erythromycin crosses the placental barrier, but 
fetal plasma levels are low. The drug is excreted in human milk. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: microbiology: Microbiology Mechanism of Action Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by 
binding 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible organisms. It does not affect nucleic acid synthesis. Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin and clindamycin, lincomycin, and 
chloramphenicol. Resistance Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone but are susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used concomitantly. Interactions With Other 
Antimicrobials Staphylococci resistant to erythromycin may emerge during a course of therapy. Antimicrobial Activity Erythromycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following 
microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: microbiology: Gram-positive Organisms: Corynebacterium 
diphtheriae Corynebacterium minutissimum Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus (resistant organisms may emerge during treatment) Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-negative 
Organisms: Bordetella pertussis Legionella pneumophila Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other Microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis Entamoeba histolytica Mycoplasma pneumoniae Treponema pallidum Ureaplasma 
urealyticum The following in vitro data are available. Erythromycin exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of 0.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: General Prescribing Ery-Ped in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to 
provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally excreted by the liver, caution should be exercised when 
erythromycin is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and WARNINGS sections.) Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of 
myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving erythromycin therapy. There have been reports of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) occurring in infants following erythromycin 
therapy. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: In one cohort of 157 newborns who were given erythromycin for pertussis prophylaxis, seven neonates (5%) developed symptoms of non-bilious 
vomiting or irritability with feeding and were subsequently diagnosed as having IHPS requiring surgical pyloromyotomy . A possible dose-response effect was described with an absolute risk of IHPS of 
5.1% for infants who took erythromycin for 8-14 days and 10% for infants who took erythromycin for 15-21 days. 2 Since erythromycin may be used in the treatment of conditions in infants which are 
associated with significant mortality or morbidity (such as pertussis or neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis infections), the benefit of erythromycin therapy needs to be weighed against the potential risk 
of developing IHPS. Parents should be informed to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: Prolonged or repeated use 
of erythromycin may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria or fungi. If superinfection occurs, erythromycin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. When indicated, 
incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Observational studies in humans have reported cardiovascular malformations after exposure
to drug products containing erythromycin during early pregnancy. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing Ery-Ped in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected 
bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of theophylline should be reduced while the patient is receiving
concomitant erythromycin therapy. There have been published reports suggesting that when oral erythromycin is given concurrently with theophylline there is a decrease in erythromycin serum 
concentrations of approximately 35%. The mechanism by which this interaction occurs is unknown. The decrease in erythromycin concentrations due to co-administration of theophylline could result in 
subtherapeutic concentrations of erythromycin. Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent verapamil, belonging to the calcium channel 
blockers drug class. Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: There have been 
reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly. Increased anticoagulation effects due to interactions of erythromycin with various oral 
anticoagulants may be more pronounced in the elderly. Erythromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of the 3A isoform subfamily of the cytochrome p450 enzyme system (CYP3A). Coadministration of 
erythromycin and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects of the 
concomitant drug. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving 
erythromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A 
isoform are also possible. The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products in post-marketing experience: Ergotamine/dihydroergotamine Post-marketing reports 
indicate that co-administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other 
tissues including the central nervous system. Concomitant administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: 
precautions: Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as triazolam and alprazolam) and Related Benzodiazepines Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may 
increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Erythromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., lovastatin and
simvastatin). Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Sildenafil (Viagra) Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC)
of sildenafil. Reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A 
based interactions of erythromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, vinblastine, and bromocriptine. 
Concomitant administration of erythromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, there have been reports of interactions of 
erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: Erythromycin has been reported to 
significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including 
electrocardiographic QT/QT c interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other ventricular arrhythmias have been observed. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, deaths have been 
reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin. There have been post-marketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin was co-administered with cisapride, 
resulting in QT prolongation, cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes most likely due to the inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by 
erythromycin. Fatalities have been reported.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increases the risk of angioedema.
2. FDAHandler responded that the label for ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE does not specifically mention an increased risk of angioedema. However, it does list allergic reactions ranging from urticaria to
anaphylaxis, which are related to immune system responses that could potentially include angioedema as a side effect.
        -----
        Final answer: The FDA label for ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE does not specifically mention an increased risk of angioedema, but it does list allergic reactions as side effects, which could 
potentially include angioedema. Therefore, while angioedema is not explicitly listed, it may be a possible side effect within the spectrum of allergic reactions to the drug.
