It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop. 
Electrocardiographic Changes: Electrocardiographic changes have been observed in clinical trials of pimozide in Tourette’s Disorder and schizophrenia. These have included prolongation of the QT 
interval, flattening, notching and inversion of the T wave and the appearance of U waves. Sudden, unexpected deaths and grand mal seizure have occurred at doses above 20 mg/day. Neuroleptic Malignant

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: precautions: The concentrations observed in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers are similar to those seen with strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine. The time to achieve steady state 
Pimozide concentrations is expected to be longer (approximately 2 weeks) in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers because of the prolonged half-life. Alternative dosing strategies are recommended in patients who 
are genetically poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ). Interaction with Food Patients should avoid grapefruit juice because it may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4. 
CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, pimozide causes a dose-related increase in pituitary and mammary tumors. 
PIMOZIDE: precautions: When mice were treated for up to 18 months with pimozide, pituitary gland changes developed in females only. These changes were characterized as hyperplasia at doses 
approximating the human dose and adenoma at doses about fifteen times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg per kg basis. The mechanism for the induction of pituitary tumors in mice is not known.
Mammary gland tumors in female mice were also increased, but these tumors are expected in rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs which elevate prolactin levels. Chronic administration of an 
antipsychotic also causes elevated prolactin levels in humans. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of 
potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, 
amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clinical studies
nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis. The available evidence, however, is considered too 
limited to be conclusive at this time. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, animals received up to 50 times the maximum recommended human dose. No increased incidence of overall tumors or 
tumors at any site was observed in either sex. Because of the limited number of animals surviving this study, the meaning of these results is unclear. Pimozide did not have mutagenic activity in the 
Ames test with four bacterial test strains, in the mouse dominant lethal test or in the micronucleus test in rats. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Reproduction studies in animals were not adequate to assess 
all aspects of fertility. Nevertheless, female rats administered pimozide had prolonged estrus cycles, an effect also produced by other antipsychotic drugs. PREGNANCY Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy 
Category C. Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 8 times the maximum human dose did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity. In the rat, however, this multiple of the 
human dose resulted in decreased pregnancies and in the retarded development of fetuses. These effects are thought to be due to an inhibition or delay in implantation which is also observed in rodents
administered other antipsychotic drugs. In the rabbit, maternal toxicity, mortality, decreased weight gain, and embryotoxicity including increased resorptions were dose-related. PIMOZIDE: precautions:
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, pimozide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the potential
risks. Nonteratogenic effects. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have
been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases 
symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Pimozide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus. LABOR & DELIVERY This drug has no recognized use in labor or delivery. PIMOZIDE: precautions: NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether pimozide is excreted in
human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity and unknown cardiovascular effects in the infant, a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. PEDIATRIC USE Although Tourette's Disorder most often has its onset between the ages of 2 
and 15 years, information on the use and efficacy of pimozide in patients less than 12 years of age is limited. A 24-week open label study in 36 children between the ages of 2 and 12 demonstrated that
pimozide has a similar safety profile in this age group as in older patients and there were no safety findings that would preclude its use in this age group. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Because its use and
safety have not been evaluated in other childhood disorders, pimozide is not recommended for use in any condition other than Tourette’s Disorder.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Treatment with pimozide tablets, USP exposes the patient to serious risks. A decision to use pimozide tablets, USP chronically in 
Tourette’s Disorder is one that deserves full consideration by the patient (or patient’s family) as well as by the treating physician. Because the goal of treatment is symptomatic improvement, the 
patient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary 
source of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only 
for use in patients with Tourette’s Disorder whose symptoms are severe and who cannot tolerate, or who do not respond to HALDOL ® (haloperidol). PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Given the 
likelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if 
possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to 
understand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under 12 years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP 
from foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed
that all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected 
deaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the 
heart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.
Also, pimozide, at a dose about 15 times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. 
Similar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the 
drug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.

including increased resorptions were dose-related. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, pimozide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential 
benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the potential risks. Nonteratogenic effects. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal 
and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. PIMOZIDE: pregnancy: There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these 
neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged 
hospitalization. Pimozide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: precautions: The concentrations observed in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers are similar to those seen with strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine. The time to achieve steady state 
Pimozide concentrations is expected to be longer (approximately 2 weeks) in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers because of the prolonged half-life. Alternative dosing strategies are recommended in patients who 
are genetically poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ). Interaction with Food Patients should avoid grapefruit juice because it may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4. 
CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, pimozide causes a dose-related increase in pituitary and mammary tumors. 
PIMOZIDE: precautions: When mice were treated for up to 18 months with pimozide, pituitary gland changes developed in females only. These changes were characterized as hyperplasia at doses 
approximating the human dose and adenoma at doses about fifteen times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg per kg basis. The mechanism for the induction of pituitary tumors in mice is not known.
Mammary gland tumors in female mice were also increased, but these tumors are expected in rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs which elevate prolactin levels. Chronic administration of an 
antipsychotic also causes elevated prolactin levels in humans. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of 
potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, 
amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clinical studies
nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis. The available evidence, however, is considered too 
limited to be conclusive at this time. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, animals received up to 50 times the maximum recommended human dose. No increased incidence of overall tumors or 
tumors at any site was observed in either sex. Because of the limited number of animals surviving this study, the meaning of these results is unclear. Pimozide did not have mutagenic activity in the 
Ames test with four bacterial test strains, in the mouse dominant lethal test or in the micronucleus test in rats. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Reproduction studies in animals were not adequate to assess 
all aspects of fertility. Nevertheless, female rats administered pimozide had prolonged estrus cycles, an effect also produced by other antipsychotic drugs. PREGNANCY Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy 
Category C. Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 8 times the maximum human dose did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity. In the rat, however, this multiple of the 
human dose resulted in decreased pregnancies and in the retarded development of fetuses. These effects are thought to be due to an inhibition or delay in implantation which is also observed in rodents
administered other antipsychotic drugs. In the rabbit, maternal toxicity, mortality, decreased weight gain, and embryotoxicity including increased resorptions were dose-related. PIMOZIDE: precautions:
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, pimozide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the potential
risks. Nonteratogenic effects. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have
been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases 
symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Pimozide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus. LABOR & DELIVERY This drug has no recognized use in labor or delivery. PIMOZIDE: precautions: NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether pimozide is excreted in
human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for tumorigenicity and unknown cardiovascular effects in the infant, a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. PEDIATRIC USE Although Tourette's Disorder most often has its onset between the ages of 2 
and 15 years, information on the use and efficacy of pimozide in patients less than 12 years of age is limited. A 24-week open label study in 36 children between the ages of 2 and 12 demonstrated that
pimozide has a similar safety profile in this age group as in older patients and there were no safety findings that would preclude its use in this age group. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Because its use and
safety have not been evaluated in other childhood disorders, pimozide is not recommended for use in any condition other than Tourette’s Disorder.

The FDAHandler was unable to provide information on whether PIMOZIDE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, responding with DO-NOT-KNOW. This indicates that the FDA
label for PIMOZIDE does not contain information regarding its effect on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the FDA label data whether 
PIMOZIDE has an effect on this risk.
