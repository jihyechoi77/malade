                Passages:
                1. Drug ALENDRONATE SODIUM: The FDA label for Alendronate Sodium does not specify information regarding the risk of aplastic anemia. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from 
this source whether Alendronate Sodium increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. 

 DO-NOT-KNOW

The justification for this answer is that the FDA label for Alendronate Sodium, as provided by FDAHandler, does not contain information about the drug's effect on the risk of aplastic anemia. Without 
specific information from the FDA label, we cannot ascertain the relationship between Alendronate Sodium and the risk of aplastic anemia.
2. Drug ALENDRONATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ALENDRONATE does not contain information regarding an increased risk of aplastic anemia, hence there is no known association between ALENDRONATE and aplastic anemia based on the FDA 
label data.

                Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of
                aplastic anemia, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Both passages provided indicate that the FDA labels for drugs in the alendronate category do not specify information regarding the risk of aplastic anemia.
2. Without specific information from the FDA label, it is not possible to determine from these sources whether drugs in the alendronate category increase or decrease the risk of aplastic anemia.
3. Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no clear effect of the alendronate category of drugs on the risk of aplastic anemia.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the alendronate category of drugs on the risk of aplastic anemia.
