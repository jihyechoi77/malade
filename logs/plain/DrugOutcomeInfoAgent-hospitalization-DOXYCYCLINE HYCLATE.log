CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Dialysis does not alter serum half-life and
thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage.         
SOURCE:DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE label


CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: spl_unclassified_section: To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of doxycycline hyclate tablets, USP and other antibacterial 
drugs, doxycycline hyclate tablets, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.         
SOURCE:DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE label


CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: information_for_patients: Information For Patients Patients taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis should be advised: — that no present-day antimalarial agent, 
including doxycycline, guarantees protection against malaria. — to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by using personal protective measures that help avoid contact with mosquitoes, especially from dusk 
to dawn (e.g., staying in well-screened areas, using mosquito nets, covering the body with clothing, and using an effective insect repellent). — that doxycycline prophylaxis: — should begin 1–2 days 
before travel to the malarious area, — should be continued daily while in the malarious area and after leaving the malarious area, — should be continued for 4 further weeks to avoid development of 
malaria after returning from an endemic area, — should not exceed 4 months. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: information_for_patients: All patients taking doxycycline should be advised: — to avoid excessive 
sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light while receiving doxycycline and to discontinue therapy if phototoxicity (e.g., skin eruption, etc.) occurs. Sunscreen or sunblock should be considered. (See 
WARNINGS .) — to drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .) — that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced 
when taken with foods, especially those which contain calcium. However, the absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk. (See DRUG INTERACTIONS .) — 
that the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced when taking bismuth subsalicylate. (See DRUG INTERACTIONS . DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: information_for_patients: ) — that the use of doxycycline might 
increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including doxycycline should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral 
infections (e.g., the common cold). When doxycycline is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the
medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the 
likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by doxycycline or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, which 
usually ends when the antibacterials are discontinued. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: information_for_patients: Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and 
bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their 
physician as soon as possible.

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: clinical_pharmacology: Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18-22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired
renal function. Hemodialysis does not alter serum half-life. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta and are found in fetal tissues. Population pharmacokinetic 
analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 pediatric patients (2-18 years of age) showed that allometrically -scaled 
clearance (CL) of doxycycline in pediatric patients ≥2 to ≤8 years of age (median  3.58 [2.27-10.82] L/h/70 kg, N =11) did not differ significantly from pediatric patients >8 to 18 years of age (3 .27
[1.11-8.12] L/h/70 kg, N=33). DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: clinical_pharmacology: For pediatric patients weighing ≤45 kg, body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those ≥2 to ≤8 years of age (median  0.071 [0
.041-0.202] L/kg/h, N=10) did not differ significantly from those >8 to 18 years of age (0.081 [0.035-0.126] L/kg/h, N=8). In pediatric patients weighing >45 kg, no clinically significant differences 
in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those ≥2 to ≤8 years (0.050 L/kg/h, N=l) and those >8 to 18 years of age (0.044 [0.014-0.121] L/kg/h, N=25). DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: No clinically significant difference in CL between oral and IV dosing was observed in the small cohort of pediatric patients who received the oral (N=19) or IV (N=21) 
formulation alone. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Doxycycline has bacteriostatic activity against a broad 
range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Resistance Cross resistance with other tetracyclines is common. Antimicrobial Activity Doxycycline has been shown to be active against most isolates 
of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the package insert for doxycycline hyclate tablets, USP. DOXYCYCLINE

The question regarding whether Doxycycline Hyclate increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization is not one that can be answered with the information available from FDA label data. The FDA label 
for a medication typically includes information on the indications for use, dosing, contraindications, warnings, precautions, adverse reactions, and other relevant clinical information. However, it 
does not typically provide direct information on the risk of hospitalization as a general outcome. Hospitalization can be a result of various factors, including the severity of the condition being 
treated, the occurrence of serious adverse reactions, or other medical complications, which may or may not be related to the use of a specific medication like Doxycycline Hyclate.

Therefore, without specific data or studies that correlate the use of Doxycycline Hyclate with hospitalization rates, it is not possible to determine whether this medication increases or decreases the
risk of hospitalization.
