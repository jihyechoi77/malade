CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to 
evaluate carcinogenic potential. In a 2-year study in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg per day, there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or 
malignant neoplasms of any type. The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli
and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-month study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg per day, benign lung tumors (small adenomas) occurred more 
frequently in female mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors, or in the overall incidence of 
tumors or malignant tumors. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: This 21-month study was repeated in CD-1 mice, and no statistically or biologically 
significant differences were observed between treated and control mice of either sex for any type of tumor. All mutagenicity tests performed (a dominant lethal study in mice, chromosome studies in 
somatic cells, a Salmonella/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test, and a nucleus anomaly test in somatic interphase nuclei) were negative. Reproduction toxicity studies in mice, rats and rabbits did 
not indicate teratogenic potential for metoprolol tartrate. Embryotoxicity and/or fetotoxicity in rats and rabbits were noted starting at doses of 50 mg/kg in rats and 25 mg/kg in rabbits, as 
demonstrated by increases in preimplantation loss, decreases in the number of viable fetuses per dose, and/or decreases in neonatal survival. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: 
carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: High doses were associated with some maternal toxicity, and growth delay of the offspring in utero , which was reflected in minimally lower 
weights at birth. The oral NOAELs for embryo-fetal development in mice, rats, and rabbits were considered to be 25, 200, and 12.5 mg/kg. This corresponds to dose levels that are approximately 0.3, 4, 
and 0.5 times, respectively, when based on surface area, the maximum human oral dose (8 mg/kg/day) of metoprolol tartrate. Metoprolol tartrate has been associated with reversible adverse effects on 
spermatogenesis starting at oral dose levels of 3.5 mg/kg in rats (a dose that is only 0.1-times the human dose, when based on surface area), although other studies have shown no effect of metoprolol 
tartrate on reproductive performance in male rats.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may 
be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. Information 
for Patients Advise patients to take metoprolol regularly and continuously, as directed, with or immediately following meals. If a dose should be missed, the patient should take only the next 
scheduled dose (without doubling it). Patients should not discontinue metoprolol without consulting the physician. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: Advise patients (1) to avoid operating automobiles 
and machinery or engaging in other tasks requiring alertness until the patient’s response to therapy with metoprolol has been determined; (2) to contact the physician if any difficulty in breathing 
occurs; (3) to inform the physician or dentist before any type of surgery that he or she is taking metoprolol. Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting Drugs: Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., 
reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Observe patients treated with metoprolol plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence 
of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: In addition, possibly significant hypertension may theoretically 
occur up to 14 days following discontinuation of the concomitant administration with an irreversible MAO inhibitor. Digitalis Glycosides and Beta-blockers: Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers 
slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and PR interval. Calcium Channel Blockers: Concomitant administration
of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. CYP2D6 Inhibitors: 
Potent inhibitors of the CYP2D6 enzyme may increase the plasma concentration of metoprolol which would mimic the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (see Pharmacokinetics section). Increase in
plasma concentrations of metoprolol would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Known clinically significant potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 are 
antidepressants such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, clomipramine, and desipramine; antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and thioridazine; 
antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propafenone; antiretrovirals such as ritonavir; antihistamines such as diphenhydramine; antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or quinidine; antifungals such as 
terbinafine. Hydralazine: Concomitant administration of hydralazine may inhibit presystemic metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: 
drug_interactions: Alpha-adrenergic Agents: Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine may be potentiated by 
beta-blockers including metoprolol. Beta-adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing reflex tachycardia. On the 
contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic blocker. If a patient is 
treated with clonidine and metoprolol concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, stop metoprolol several days before clonidine is withdrawn. Rebound hypertension that can follow 
withdrawal of clonidine may be increased in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting Drugs: 
Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Observe patients treated with metoprolol plus a

metabolizer (see Pharmacokinetics section). Increase in plasma concentrations of metoprolol would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: Ergot Alkaloid: 
Concomitant administration with beta-blockers may enhance the vasoconstrictive action of ergot alkaloids. Dipyridamole: In general, administration of a beta-blocker should be withheld before 
dipyridamole testing, with careful monitoring of heart rate following the dipyridamole injection. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have been conducted 
to evaluate carcinogenic potential. In a 2-year study in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg per day, there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or

This corresponds to dose levels that are approximately 0.3, 4, and 0.5 times, respectively, when based on surface area, the maximum human oral dose (8 mg/kg/day) of metoprolol tartrate. METOPROLOL 
TARTRATE: precautions: Metoprolol tartrate has been associated with reversible adverse effects on spermatogenesis starting at oral dose levels of 3.5 mg/kg in rats (a dose that is only 0.1-times the 
human dose, when based on surface area), although other studies have shown no effect of metoprolol tartrate on reproductive performance in male rats. Pregnancy Category C Upon confirming the diagnosis
of pregnancy, women should immediately inform the doctor. Metoprolol has been shown to increase postimplantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at doses up to 11 times the maximum daily 
human dose of 450 mg, when based on surface area. Distribution studies in mice confirm exposure of the fetus when metoprolol is administered to the pregnant animal. These limited animal studies do not
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to teratogenicity (see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: There are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The amount of data on the use of metoprolol in pregnant women is limited. The risk to the fetus/mother is unknown. Because animal reproduction studies are 
not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in a very small quantity. An infant 
consuming 1 liter of breast milk daily would receive a dose of less than 1 mg of the drug. Fertility The effects of metoprolol on the fertility of human have not been studied. Metoprolol showed 
effects on spermatogenesis in male rats at a therapeutic dose level, but had no effect on rates of conception at higher doses in animal fertility studies (see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment 
of Fertility ). Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical trials of metoprolol in hypertension 
did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether patients over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to metoprolol. Other reported clinical 
experience in elderly hypertensive patients has not identified any difference in response from younger patients. In worldwide clinical trials of metoprolol in myocardial infarction, where 
approximately 478 patients were over 65 years of age (0 over 75 years of age), no age-related differences in safety and effectiveness were found. Other reported clinical experience in myocardial 
infarction has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals taking metoprolol cannot be categorically ruled
out. Therefore, in general, it is recommended that dosing proceed with caution in this population.

an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation for time and place, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, slightly clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on 
neuropsychometrics. Cardiovascular: Intensification of AV block (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura and thrombocytopenic purpura. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: 
adverse_reactions: Hypersensitive Reactions: Fever combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm and respiratory distress. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been 
reported during postapproval use of metoprolol: confusional state, an increase in blood triglycerides and a decrease in High Density Lipoprotein (HDL). Because these reports are from a population of 
uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Individualized the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken 
with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. Increase the dosage 
at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective 
dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: While once-daily dosing is 
effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period, and larger or more 
frequent daily doses may be required. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the
day. Beta 1 selectivity diminishes as the dose of metoprolol is increased. Angina Pectoris The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be 
taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until 
optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is pronounced slowing of the heart rate. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets 
is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, gradually decrease the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks (see WARNINGS ). 
Myocardial Infarction Early Treatment During the early phase of definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, initiate treatment with metoprolol tartrate tablets as soon as possible after the 
patient's arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient’s hemodynamic condition has stabilized. Begin treatment in this 
early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; give the injections at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous 
administration of metoprolol, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Myocardial Infarction In a large (1,395 patients randomized), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, metoprolol was shown to reduce 3-month 
mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in the hospital, once their clinical 
condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of shock, and/or more than minimal 
basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of metoprolol or placebo, given in a coronary care or comparable unit. Oral
maintenance therapy with metoprolol or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After this double-blind period, all patients were given metoprolol and followed up to 1 year. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: 
pharmacokinetics: The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the metoprolol- and placebo-treatment groups. Among patients treated with metoprolol, 
there were comparable reductions in 3-month mortality for those treated early (≤8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the incidence of ventricular 
fibrillation and in chest pain following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with metoprolol and were independent of the interval between onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy. In 
this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both very early (intra-venously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while placebo patients received no beta-blocker treatment for 
this period. The study thus was able to show a benefit from the overall metoprolol regimen but cannot separate the benefit of very early intravenous treatment from the benefit of later beta-blocker 
therapy. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Nonetheless, because the overall regimen showed a clear beneficial effect on survival without evidence of an early adverse effect on survival, one 
acceptable dosage regimen is the precise regimen used in the trial. Because the specific benefit of very early treatment remains to be defined however, it is also reasonable to administer the drug 
orally to patients at a later time as is recommended for certain other beta-blockers.

increase or decrease in the risk of bleeding as an adverse reaction or precaution associated with the drug. However, the label does mention hematologic adverse reactions such as agranulocytosis, 
nonthrombocytopenic purpura, and thrombocytopenic purpura. These conditions can be associated with bleeding disorders, but the label does not explicitly state that METOPROLOL TARTRATE increases the 
risk of bleeding in general.

Given this information, it is not possible to definitively say whether METOPROLOL TARTRATE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding based solely on the FDA label data. Therefore, the answer to 
whether METOPROLOL TARTRATE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding is DO-NOT-KNOW.

        Question: Does METOPROLOL TARTRATE increase or decrease the risk of bleeding?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether METOPROLOL TARTRATE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.
2. FDAHandler responded that the METOPROLOL TARTRATE label does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of bleeding as an adverse reaction or precaution.
3. The label does mention hematologic adverse reactions such as agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura, and thrombocytopenic purpura, which can be associated with bleeding disorders, but does 
not explicitly state that METOPROLOL TARTRATE increases the risk of bleeding in general.

        If any flaws in the reasoning used to produce your
        answer were identified, you must try again.

decreases the risk of bleeding is DO-NOT-KNOW. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that the FDA label for METOPROLOL TARTRATE does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of 
bleeding as an adverse reaction or precaution. While the label does mention hematologic adverse reactions such as agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura, and thrombocytopenic purpura, which can 
be associated with bleeding disorders, it does not explicitly state that METOPROLOL TARTRATE increases the risk of bleeding in general. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, we cannot definitively 
say whether METOPROLOL TARTRATE has an effect on the risk of bleeding.
