CONTENT: ABELCET: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use: Forty-nine elderly patients, age 65 years or over, have been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, prospective,
single-arm study. No serious unexpected adverse events have been reported.         
SOURCE:ABELCET label


CONTENT: ABELCET: pregnancy: Pregnancy: There are no reports of pregnant women having been treated with ABELCET ® . Teratogenic Effects. Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits at doses of ABELCET ® 
up to 0.64 times the human dose revealed no harm to the fetus. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, and adequate and well-controlled studies have not been 
conducted in pregnant women, ABELCET ® should be used during pregnancy only after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

CONTENT: ABELCET: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate patients), 
of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 patients were 
treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with ABELCET ® , 9% 
discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient chills and/or fever 
during infusion of the drug. ABELCET: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14 Increased Serum Creatinine 11

The question was whether ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. I attempted to use the recipient_message tool to contact FDAHandler to inquire about the risk of hip fracture 
associated with ABELCET. However, the tool did not function as expected, and I did not receive any information from FDAHandler. Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable answer based on FDA label data.
