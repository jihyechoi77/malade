rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, 2514
patients were treated with tigecycline for injection. Tigecycline for injection was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of patients compared to 6% for all comparators. Table 1 shows the 
incidence of adverse reactions through test of cure reported in ≥2% of patients in these trials. Table 1. TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions Through Test of Cure

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: In patients treated for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), nausea incidence was 35% for tigecycline for injection and 9% for 
vancomycin/aztreonam; vomiting incidence was 20% for tigecycline for injection and 4% for vancomycin/aztreonam. In patients treated for complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), nausea incidence 
was 25% for tigecycline for injection and 21% for imipenem/cilastatin; vomiting incidence was 20% for tigecycline for injection and 15% for imipenem/cilastatin. TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: In 
patients treated for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), nausea incidence was 24% for tigecycline for injection and 8% for levofloxacin; vomiting incidence was 16% for tigecycline for 
injection and 6% for levofloxacin. Discontinuation from tigecycline for injection was most frequently associated with nausea (1%) and vomiting (1%). For comparators, discontinuation was most 
frequently associated with nausea (<1%). TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: The following adverse reactions were reported (<2%) in patients receiving tigecycline for injection in clinical studies: Body 
as a Whole : injection site inflammation, injection site pain, injection site reaction, septic shock, allergic reaction, chills, injection site edema, injection site phlebitis Cardiovascular System:

SOURCE:TIGECYCLINE label


CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS All-Cause Mortality: A meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials demonstrated an increase in all-cause mortality in 
tigecycline for injection-treated patients compared to controls with a risk difference of 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.2). The cause of this increase has not been established. An increase was also seen in a 
meta-analysis limited to the approved indications [0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2)]. The greatest difference in mortality was seen in tigecycline for injection-treated patients with ventilator-associated 
pneumonia. ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: have been reported with tigecycline for injection and may be life-threatening. Avoid use in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines. ( 5.
TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 3 ) Hepatic Adverse Effects: have been reported with tigecycline for injection. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during tigecycline for injection 
therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline therapy. ( 5.4 ) Pancreatitis: including fatalities, has been reported 
with tigecycline for injection. If pancreatitis is suspected, then consider stopping tigecycline for injection. ( 5.5 ) Monitoring Blood Coagulation Parameters: Hypofibrinogenemia has been reported 
with tigecycline for injection. Monitor blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen, at baseline and regularly during treatment with tigecycline for injection. ( 5. TIGECYCLINE: 
warnings_and_cautions: 6 ) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia: The use of tigecycline for injection during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 
years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia. ( 5.7 ) Inhibition of Bone Growth: The use of tigecycline for injection during the second and third 
trimester of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. ( 5.8 ) Clostridium difficile associated Diarrhea (CDAD): evaluate if diarrhea 
occurs. (5.9 ) 5.1 All-Cause Mortality An increase in all-cause mortality has been observed in a meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials in tigecycline for injection-treated patients versus 
comparator-treated patients.         
SOURCE:TIGECYCLINE label


CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: The adjusted risk difference for mortality stratified by trial weight was 0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2). The cause of this mortality difference has not been 
established. Generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, complications of infection or underlying co-morbidities. Tigecycline for injection should be reserved for use in situations when 
alternative treatments are not suitable  . 5.2 Mortality Imbalance and Lower Cure Rates in Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia A trial of patients with hospital acquired, including ventilator-associated, 
pneumonia failed to demonstrate the efficacy of tigecycline for injection. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: In this trial, patients were randomized to receive tigecycline for injection (100 mg 
initially, then 50 mg every 12 hours) or a comparator. In addition, patients were allowed to receive specified adjunctive therapies. The sub-group of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who 
received tigecycline for injection had lower cure rates (47.9% versus 70.1% for the clinically evaluable population). In this trial, greater mortality was seen in patients with ventilator-associated 
pneumonia who received tigecycline for injection (25/131 [19.1%] versus 15/122 [12.3%] in comparator-treated patients)  . Particularly high mortality was seen among tigecycline for injection-treated 
patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia at baseline (9/18 [50.0%] versus 1/13 [7. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 7%] in comparator-treated patients). 5.3 Anaphylactic 
Reactions Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including tigecycline for injection, and may be life-threatening. Tigecycline for injection is structurally 
similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and should be avoided in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. 5.4 Hepatic Adverse Effects Increases in 
total bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time and transaminases have been seen in patients treated with tigecycline. Isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure have been 
reported in patients being treated with tigecycline. Some of these patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Patients who develop abnormal liver 
function tests during tigecycline therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline therapy. Hepatic dysfunction may occur
after the drug has been discontinued. 5.5 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal cases, has occurred in association with tigecycline treatment. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be 
considered in patients taking tigecycline who develop clinical symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Cases have been reported in patients without known risk 
factors for pancreatitis. Patients usually improve after tigecycline discontinuation. Consideration should be given to the cessation of the treatment with tigecycline in cases suspected of having 
developed pancreatitis  . 5. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 6 Monitoring of Blood Coagulation Parameters Hypofibrinogenemia has been reported in patients treated with tigecycline for injection  .
Obtain baseline blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen, and continue to monitor regularly during treatment with tigecycline for injection. 5.7 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The
use of tigecycline for injection during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). 
This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of tetracyclines, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported.

ANSWER: The available information from the TIGECYCLINE label does not specifically mention angioedema as an adverse reaction. However, anaphylactic reactions, which can include symptoms such as 
angioedema, have been reported with tigecycline for injection and may be life-threatening. Patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines should avoid using tigecycline due to the risk of 
serious allergic reactions.

specifically mention angioedema as an adverse reaction. However, anaphylactic reactions, which can include symptoms such as angioedema, have been reported with tigecycline for injection and may be 
life-threatening. Patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines should avoid using tigecycline due to the risk of serious allergic reactions.

        Question: Does TIGECYCLINE increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether TIGECYCLINE increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.
2. FDAHandler responded that the TIGECYCLINE label does not specifically mention angioedema as an adverse reaction. However, anaphylactic reactions, which can include symptoms such as angioedema, have
been reported with tigecycline for injection and may be life-threatening. Patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines should avoid using tigecycline due to the risk of serious allergic 
reactions.
        -----
        Final answer: The FDA label for TIGECYCLINE does not specifically list angioedema as an adverse reaction, but anaphylactic reactions, which can include angioedema, have been reported. 
Therefore, while a direct causal relationship is not established, there is a potential risk of angioedema, especially in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines.

The FDA label for TIGECYCLINE does not specifically list angioedema as an adverse reaction, but anaphylactic reactions, which can include symptoms such as angioedema, have been reported. Therefore, 
while a direct causal relationship is not established, there is a potential risk of angioedema, especially in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines.
