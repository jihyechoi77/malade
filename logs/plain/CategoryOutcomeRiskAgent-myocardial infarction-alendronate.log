                Passages:
                1. Drug ALENDRONATE SODIUM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ALENDRONATE SODIUM does not specify any information regarding its effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, it is not known whether ALENDRONATE SODIUM increases or 
decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.
2. Drug ALENDRONATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether ALENDRONATE increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. After consulting with FDAHandler, the response was DO-NOT-KNOW, which indicates that the FDA label for 
ALENDRONATE does not specify any information regarding its effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine if ALENDRONATE has any 
effect on the risk of myocardial infarction.
                ---------
                Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of
                myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Both passages provided indicate that there is no specific information on the FDA label for drugs in the alendronate category regarding their effect on the risk of myocardial infarction.
2. Since the FDA label does not specify any information about the effect of alendronate drugs on myocardial infarction risk, we cannot determine if there is an increase, decrease, or no clear effect 
based on this data.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the alendronate category of drugs on the risk of myocardial infarction based on the information provided.
