CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: John’s wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, 
valproate sodium c , valproic acid c a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John’s wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic 
acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by 
phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy 
with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting
Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide 
Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance . Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, 
pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered 
phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Prevention or Management: Patients should be 
monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Warfarin Increased and 
decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is co-administered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, 
rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate,
lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, 
nelfin EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: avir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active 
metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, 
verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of 
phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: 3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate 
Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding 
preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding 
preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to 
measure serum phenytoin concentrations.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: John’s wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, 
valproate sodium c , valproic acid c a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John’s wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic 
acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by 
phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy 
with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting
Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide 
Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance . Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, 
pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered 
phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Prevention or Management: Patients should be 
monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Warfarin Increased and 
decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is co-administered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, 
rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate,
lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, 
nelfin EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: avir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active 
metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, 
verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of 
phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: 3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate 
Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding 
preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding 
preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to 
measure serum phenytoin concentrations.

I cannot provide an answer to the question about the risk of hospitalization associated with extended phenytoin sodium without specific data from the FDA label. Since the FDAHandler has not provided 
an answer, my response must be DO-NOT-KNOW.

The FDA label data does not specify information regarding the general risk of hospitalization associated with the use of extended phenytoin sodium. Hospitalization risk can be influenced by a variety 
of factors, including the underlying condition being treated, the patient's overall health, and the presence of side effects or adverse reactions to the medication. Without specific data, it is not 
possible to determine whether extended phenytoin sodium increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization.
