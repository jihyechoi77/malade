        -----
        
CONTENT: ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: Treatment should begin with the intravenous administration of 5 mg atenolol over 5 minutes followed by another 5 mg intravenous injection 10 minutes 
later. Atenolol injection should be administered under carefully controlled conditions including monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram. Dilutions of atenolol injection in 
Dextrose Injection USP, Sodium Chloride Injection USP, or Sodium Chloride and Dextrose Injection may be used. These admixtures are stable for 48 hours if they are not used immediately. In patients who
tolerate the full intravenous dose (10 mg), atenolol tablets 50 mg should be initiated 10 minutes after the last intravenous dose followed by another 50 mg oral dose 12 hours later. Thereafter, 
atenolol can be given orally either 100 mg once daily or 50 mg twice a day for a further 6 to 9 days or until discharge from the hospital. ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: If bradycardia or 
hypotension requiring treatment or any other untoward effects occur, atenolol should be discontinued (see full prescribing information prior to initiating therapy with atenolol tablets). Data from 
other beta blocker trials suggest that if there is any question concerning the use of IV beta blocker or clinical estimate that there is a contraindication, the IV beta blocker may be eliminated and 
patients fulfilling the safety criteria may be given atenolol tablets 50 mg twice daily or 100 mg once a day for at least seven days (if the IV dosing is excluded). Although the demonstration of 
efficacy of atenolol is based entirely on data from the first seven postinfarction days, data from other beta blocker trials suggest that treatment with beta blockers that are effective in the 
postinfarction setting may be continued for one to three years if there are no contraindications. ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: Atenolol is an additional treatment to standard coronary care 
unit therapy. Elderly Patients or Patients with Renal Impairment Atenolol is excreted by the kidneys; consequently dosage should be adjusted in cases of severe impairment of renal function. In 
general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, 
and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Evaluation of patients with hypertension or myocardial infarction should always include assessment of renal function. Atenolol excretion would be 
expected to decrease with advancing age. No significant accumulation of atenolol occurs until creatinine clearance falls below 35 mL/min/1.73m 2 . Accumulation of atenolol and prolongation of its 
half-life were studied in subjects with creatinine clearance between 5 and 105 mL/min. ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: Peak plasma levels were significantly increased in subjects with creatinine 
clearances below 30 mL/min. The following maximum oral dosages are recommended for elderly, renally-impaired patients and for patients with renal impairment due to other causes: Creatinine Clearance 
(mL/min/1.73m 2 ) Atenolol Elimination Half-Life (h) Maximum Dosage 15-35 16-27 50 mg daily <15 >27 25 mg daily Some renally impaired or elderly patients being treated for hypertension may require a 
lower starting dose of atenolol: 25 mg given as one tablet a day. If this 25 mg dose is used, assessment of efficacy must be made carefully. This should include measurement of blood pressure just 
prior to the next dose ("trough" blood pressure) to ensure that the treatment effect is present for a full 24 hours. ATENOLOL: dosage_and_administration: Although a similar dosage reduction may be 
considered for elderly and/or renally impaired patients being treated for indications other than hypertension, data are not available for these patient populations. Patients on hemodialysis should be 
given 25 mg or 50 mg after each dialysis; this should be done under hospital supervision as marked falls in blood pressure can occur. Cessation of Therapy in Patients with Angina Pectoris If 
withdrawal of atenolol therapy is planned, it should be achieved gradually and patients should be carefully observed and advised to limit physical activity to a minimum.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Atenolol is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk 
of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of 
pharmacologic classes including atenolol. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, 
antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and 
management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood 
Pressure (JNC). ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized 
controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely
responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular 
mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so 
that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations
with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such 
patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients,
and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. 
Atenolol may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis Atenolol is indicated for the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris. 
ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: Acute Myocardial Infarction Atenolol is indicated in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce
cardiovascular mortality. Treatment can be initiated as soon as the patient's clinical condition allows (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and WARNINGS ). In general, there is no 
basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the ISIS-1 trial (blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg systolic, heart rate less than 50 bpm) or have other reasons to avoid beta blockade. 
As noted above, some subgroups (e.g., elderly patients with systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg) seemed less likely to benefit.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with atenolol
plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Calcium channel 
blockers may also have an additive effect when given with atenolol (see WARNINGS ). Disopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide 
has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be 
additive to those seen with beta blockers. ATENOLOL: drug_interactions: Beta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension, which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are 
coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should 
be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped. Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, e.g., indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta 
blockers. Information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited. Data from several studies, i.e., TIMI-II, ISIS-2, currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and 
beta blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting. ATENOLOL: drug_interactions: While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a
more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction. Both 
digitalis glycosides and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: Pharmacodynamics In standard animal or human pharmacological tests, beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity of atenolol has been demonstrated by: (1) reduction in 
resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol induced tachycardia, and (4) 
reduction in reflex orthostatic tachycardia. A significant beta-blocking effect of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise tachycardia, is apparent within one hour following oral administration
of a single dose. This effect is maximal at about 2 to 4 hours, and persists for at least 24 hours. Maximum reduction in exercise tachycardia occurs within 5 minutes of an intravenous dose. ATENOLOL: 
pharmacodynamics: For both orally and intravenously administered drug, the duration of action is dose related and also bears a linear relationship to the logarithm of plasma atenolol concentration. 
The effect on exercise tachycardia of a single 10 mg intravenous dose is largely dissipated by 12 hours, whereas beta-blocking activity of single oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg is still evident beyond
24 hours following administration. However, as has been shown for all beta-blocking agents, the antihypertensive effect does not appear to be related to plasma level. In normal subjects, the beta1 
selectivity of atenolol has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent betab-locking doses of propranolol. ATENOLOL:
pharmacodynamics: In asthmatic patients, a dose of atenolol producing a greater effect on resting heart rate than propranolol resulted in much less increase in airway resistance. In a placebo 
controlled comparison of approximately equipotent oral doses of several beta blockers, atenolol produced a significantly smaller decrease of FEV1 than nonselective beta blockers such as propranolol 
and, unlike those agents, did not inhibit bronchodilation in response to isoproterenol. Consistent with its negative chronotropic effect due to beta blockade of the SA node, atenolol increases sinus 
cycle length and sinus node recovery time. Conduction in the AV node is also prolonged. Atenolol is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity, and increasing the dose well beyond that producing beta 
blockade does not further depress myocardial contractility. Several studies have demonstrated a moderate (approximately 10%) increase in stroke volume at rest and during exercise. ATENOLOL: 
pharmacodynamics: In controlled clinical trials, atenolol, given as a single daily oral dose, was an effective antihypertensive agent providing 24-hour reduction of blood pressure. Atenolol has been 
studied in combination with thiazide-type diuretics, and the blood pressure effects of the combination are approximately additive. Atenolol is also compatible with methyldopa, hydralazine, and 
prazosin, each combination resulting in a larger fall in blood pressure than with the single agents. The dose range of atenolol is narrow and increasing the dose beyond 100 mg once daily is not 
associated with increased antihypertensive effect. The mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents have not been established. ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: Several possible 
mechanisms have been proposed and include: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output, (2) a central 
effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery, and (3) suppression of renin activity. The results from long-term studies have not shown any diminution of the antihypertensive efficacy
of atenolol with prolonged use. By blocking the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines and by decreasing blood pressure, atenolol generally reduces the oxygen requirements of 
the heart at any given level of effort, making it useful for many patients in the long-term management of angina pectoris. On the other hand, atenolol can increase oxygen requirements by increasing 
left ventricular fiber length and end diastolic pressure, particularly in patients with heart failure. ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: In a multicenter clinical trial (ISIS-1) conducted in 16,027 patients
with suspected myocardial infarction, patients presenting within 12 hours (mean = 5 hours) after the onset of pain were randomized to either conventional therapy plus atenolol (n = 8,037), or 
conventional therapy alone (n = 7,990). Patients with a heart rate of < 50 bpm or systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg, or with other contraindications to beta blockade were excluded. Thirty-eight 
percent of each group were treated within 4 hours of onset of pain. The mean time from onset of pain to entry was 5.0 ± 2.7 hours in both groups. ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: Patients in the atenolol 
group were to receive atenolol injection 5 to 10 mg given over 5 minutes plus atenolol tablets 50 mg every 12 hours orally on the first study day (the first oral dose administered about 15 minutes 
after the IV dose) followed by either atenolol tablets 100 mg once daily or atenolol tablets 50 mg twice daily on days 2 to 7. The groups were similar in demographic and medical history 
characteristics and in electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction, bundle branch block, and first degree atrioventricular block at entry. During the treatment period (days 0 to 7), the 
vascular mortality rates were 3.89% in the atenolol group (313 deaths) and 4.57% in the control group (365 deaths). This absolute difference in rates, 0.68%, is statistically significant at the P< 0.
