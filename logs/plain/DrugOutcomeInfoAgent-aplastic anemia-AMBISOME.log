reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with Am B isome administration; on occasion this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the 
reaction developed within a few minutes after the start of infusion and disappeared rapidly when the infusion was stopped. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: The symptoms do not occur with every dose and 
usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse 
events also have been reported in 2% to 10% of Am B isome-treated patients receiving chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, or who had HIV disease in six comparative, clinical trials: Body as a

Post-marketing Experience The following infrequent adverse experiences have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, in addition to those mentioned above: angioedema, erythema, urticaria, 
bronchospasm, cyanosis/hypoventilation, pulmonary edema, agranulocytosis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and rhabdomyolysis. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Clinical Laboratory Values The effect of Am B isome on 
renal and hepatic function and on serum electrolytes was assessed from laboratory values measured repeatedly in Study 94-0-002. The frequency and magnitude of hepatic test abnormalities were similar 
in the Am B isome and amphotericin B groups. Nephrotoxicity was defined as creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in pediatric patients, and creatinine values increasing 
100% or more over pretreatment levels in adult patients, provided the peak creatinine concentration was > 1.2 mg/dL. Hypokalemia was defined as potassium levels ≤ 2.5 mmol/L any time during treatment.
AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Incidence of nephrotoxicity, mean peak serum creatinine concentration, mean change from baseline in serum creatinine, and incidence of hypokalemia in the double-blind, 
randomized study were lower in the Am B isome group as summarized in the following table: Study 94-0-002 Laboratory Evidence of Nephrotoxicity AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/day Total

43 (12.5%) Mycologically-confirmed fungal infections at study entry were cured in 8 of 11 patients in the Am B isome group and 7 of 10 in the amphotericin B group. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Study 
97-0-034, a randomized, double-blind, comparative multi-center trial, evaluated the safety of Am B isome (3 and 5 mg/kg/day) compared with amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day) in the empirical 
treatment of 202 adult and 42 pediatric neutropenic patients. One hundred and sixty-six (166) patients received Am B isome (85 patients received 3 mg/kg/day and 81 received 5 mg/kg/day) and 78 
patients received amphotericin B lipid complex. The study patients were febrile despite having received at least 72 hours of broad spectrum antibacterial therapy. The primary endpoint of this study 
was safety. The study was not designed to draw statistically meaningful conclusions related to comparative efficacy and, in fact, Abelcet is not labeled for this indication. AMBISOME: 
clinical_studies: Two supportive, prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative multi-center studies examined the efficacy of two dosages of Am B isome (1 and 3 mg/kg/day) compared to amphotericin 
B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of neutropenic patients with presumed fungal infections. These patients were undergoing chemotherapy as part of a bone marrow transplant or had 
hematological disease. Study 104-10 enrolled adult patients (n = 134). Study 104-14 enrolled pediatric patients (n = 214). Both studies support the efficacy equivalence of Am B isome and amphotericin 
B as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis in HIV-Infected Patients Study 94-0-013, a randomized, double-blind, 
comparative multi-center trial, evaluated the efficacy of Am B isome at doses (3 and 6 mg/kg/day) compared with amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg/day) for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis
in 266 adult and one pediatric HIV-positive patients (the pediatric patient received amphotericin B deoxycholate). Of the 267 treated patients, 86 received Am B isome 3 mg/kg/day, 94 received 6 
mg/kg/day and 87 received amphotericin B deoxycholate; cryptococcal meningitis was documented by a positive CSF culture at baseline in 73, 85 and 76 patients, respectively. Patients received study 
drug once daily for an induction period of 11 to 21 days. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Following induction, all patients were switched to oral fluconazole at 400 mg/day for adults and 200 mg/day for 
patients less than 13 years of age to complete 10 weeks of protocol-directed therapy. For mycologically evaluable patients, defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study 
drug, had a positive baseline CSF culture, and had at least one follow-up culture, success was evaluated at week 2 (i.e., 14 ± 4 days), and was defined as CSF culture conversion. Success rates at 2 
weeks for Am B isome and amphotericin B deoxycholate are summarized in the following table: Success Rates at 2 Weeks (CSF Culture Conversion) Study 94-0-013 AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day AmBisome 6 mg/kg/day

followed for 6 months or more after treatment, the overall success rate among immunocompetent patients was 96.5% and the overall success rate among immunocompromised patients was 11.8% due to relapse 
in the majority of patients. While case reports have suggested there may be a role for long-term therapy to prevent relapses in HIV coinfected patients (Lopez-Dupla, et al. AMBISOME: clinical_studies:
J Antimicrob Chemother 1993; 32: 657-659), there are no data to date documenting the efficacy or safety of repeat courses of Am B isome or of maintenance therapy with this drug among immunocompromised
patients.

renal and hepatic function and on serum electrolytes was assessed from laboratory values measured repeatedly in Study 94-0-002. The frequency and magnitude of hepatic test abnormalities were similar 
in the Am B isome and amphotericin B groups. Nephrotoxicity was defined as creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in pediatric patients, and creatinine values increasing 
100% or more over pretreatment levels in adult patients, provided the peak creatinine concentration was > 1.2 mg/dL. Hypokalemia was defined as potassium levels ≤ 2.5 mmol/L any time during treatment.
AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Incidence of nephrotoxicity, mean peak serum creatinine concentration, mean change from baseline in serum creatinine, and incidence of hypokalemia in the double-blind, 
randomized study were lower in the Am B isome group as summarized in the following table: Study 94-0-002 Laboratory Evidence of Nephrotoxicity AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/day Total

97-0-034, a randomized, double-blind, comparative multi-center trial, evaluated the safety of Am B isome (3 and 5 mg/kg/day) compared with amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day) in the empirical 
treatment of 202 adult and 42 pediatric neutropenic patients. One hundred and sixty-six (166) patients received Am B isome (85 patients received 3 mg/kg/day and 81 received 5 mg/kg/day) and 78 
patients received amphotericin B lipid complex. The study patients were febrile despite having received at least 72 hours of broad spectrum antibacterial therapy. The primary endpoint of this study 
was safety. The study was not designed to draw statistically meaningful conclusions related to comparative efficacy and, in fact, Abelcet is not labeled for this indication. AMBISOME: 
clinical_studies: Two supportive, prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative multi-center studies examined the efficacy of two dosages of Am B isome (1 and 3 mg/kg/day) compared to amphotericin 
B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of neutropenic patients with presumed fungal infections. These patients were undergoing chemotherapy as part of a bone marrow transplant or had 
hematological disease. Study 104-10 enrolled adult patients (n = 134). Study 104-14 enrolled pediatric patients (n = 214). Both studies support the efficacy equivalence of Am B isome and amphotericin 
B as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis in HIV-Infected Patients Study 94-0-013, a randomized, double-blind, 
comparative multi-center trial, evaluated the efficacy of Am B isome at doses (3 and 6 mg/kg/day) compared with amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg/day) for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis
in 266 adult and one pediatric HIV-positive patients (the pediatric patient received amphotericin B deoxycholate). Of the 267 treated patients, 86 received Am B isome 3 mg/kg/day, 94 received 6 
mg/kg/day and 87 received amphotericin B deoxycholate; cryptococcal meningitis was documented by a positive CSF culture at baseline in 73, 85 and 76 patients, respectively. Patients received study 
drug once daily for an induction period of 11 to 21 days. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Following induction, all patients were switched to oral fluconazole at 400 mg/day for adults and 200 mg/day for 
patients less than 13 years of age to complete 10 weeks of protocol-directed therapy. For mycologically evaluable patients, defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study 
drug, had a positive baseline CSF culture, and had at least one follow-up culture, success was evaluated at week 2 (i.e., 14 ± 4 days), and was defined as CSF culture conversion. Success rates at 2 
weeks for Am B isome and amphotericin B deoxycholate are summarized in the following table: Success Rates at 2 Weeks (CSF Culture Conversion) Study 94-0-013 AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day AmBisome 6 mg/kg/day

B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of neutropenic patients with presumed fungal infections. These patients were undergoing chemotherapy as part of a bone marrow transplant or had 
hematological disease. Study 104-10 enrolled adult patients (n = 134). Study 104-14 enrolled pediatric patients (n = 214). Both studies support the efficacy equivalence of Am B isome and amphotericin

reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with Am B isome administration; on occasion this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the 
reaction developed within a few minutes after the start of infusion and disappeared rapidly when the infusion was stopped. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: The symptoms do not occur with every dose and 
usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse

bronchospasm, cyanosis/hypoventilation, pulmonary edema, agranulocytosis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and rhabdomyolysis. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Clinical Laboratory Values The effect of Am B isome on 
renal and hepatic function and on serum electrolytes was assessed from laboratory values measured repeatedly in Study 94-0-002. The frequency and magnitude of hepatic test abnormalities were similar 
in the Am B isome and amphotericin B groups. Nephrotoxicity was defined as creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in pediatric patients, and creatinine values increasing 
100% or more over pretreatment levels in adult patients, provided the peak creatinine concentration was > 1.2 mg/dL. Hypokalemia was defined as potassium levels ≤ 2.5 mmol/L any time during treatment.
AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Incidence of nephrotoxicity, mean peak serum creatinine concentration, mean change from baseline in serum creatinine, and incidence of hypokalemia in the double-blind, 
randomized study were lower in the Am B isome group as summarized in the following table: Study 94-0-002 Laboratory Evidence of Nephrotoxicity AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/day Total

reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with Am B isome administration; on occasion this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the 
reaction developed within a few minutes after the start of infusion and disappeared rapidly when the infusion was stopped. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: The symptoms do not occur with every dose and 
usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse 
events also have been reported in 2% to 10% of Am B isome-treated patients receiving chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, or who had HIV disease in six comparative, clinical trials: Body as a

Post-marketing Experience The following infrequent adverse experiences have been reported in post-marketing surveillance, in addition to those mentioned above: angioedema, erythema, urticaria, 
bronchospasm, cyanosis/hypoventilation, pulmonary edema, agranulocytosis, hemorrhagic cystitis, and rhabdomyolysis. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Clinical Laboratory Values The effect of Am B isome on 
renal and hepatic function and on serum electrolytes was assessed from laboratory values measured repeatedly in Study 94-0-002. The frequency and magnitude of hepatic test abnormalities were similar 
in the Am B isome and amphotericin B groups. Nephrotoxicity was defined as creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in pediatric patients, and creatinine values increasing 
100% or more over pretreatment levels in adult patients, provided the peak creatinine concentration was > 1.2 mg/dL. Hypokalemia was defined as potassium levels ≤ 2.5 mmol/L any time during treatment.
AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Incidence of nephrotoxicity, mean peak serum creatinine concentration, mean change from baseline in serum creatinine, and incidence of hypokalemia in the double-blind, 
randomized study were lower in the Am B isome group as summarized in the following table: Study 94-0-002 Laboratory Evidence of Nephrotoxicity AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/day Total

97-0-034, a randomized, double-blind, comparative multi-center trial, evaluated the safety of Am B isome (3 and 5 mg/kg/day) compared with amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day) in the empirical 
treatment of 202 adult and 42 pediatric neutropenic patients. One hundred and sixty-six (166) patients received Am B isome (85 patients received 3 mg/kg/day and 81 received 5 mg/kg/day) and 78 
patients received amphotericin B lipid complex. The study patients were febrile despite having received at least 72 hours of broad spectrum antibacterial therapy. The primary endpoint of this study 
was safety. The study was not designed to draw statistically meaningful conclusions related to comparative efficacy and, in fact, Abelcet is not labeled for this indication. AMBISOME: 
clinical_studies: Two supportive, prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative multi-center studies examined the efficacy of two dosages of Am B isome (1 and 3 mg/kg/day) compared to amphotericin 
B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of neutropenic patients with presumed fungal infections. These patients were undergoing chemotherapy as part of a bone marrow transplant or had 
hematological disease. Study 104-10 enrolled adult patients (n = 134). Study 104-14 enrolled pediatric patients (n = 214). Both studies support the efficacy equivalence of Am B isome and amphotericin 
B as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis in HIV-Infected Patients Study 94-0-013, a randomized, double-blind,

        Question: Does AMBISOME increase or decrease the risk of aplastic anemia?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I attempted to use the recipient_message tool to ask FDAHandler whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.
2. However, there was an error in the process, and I did not receive a response from FDAHandler.

        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. I attempted to consult FDAHandler for information regarding the effects of AMBISOME on the risk of aplastic 
anemia. However, due to an error in the process, I did not receive any information from FDAHandler. Therefore, I cannot provide a knowledgeable answer to this question based on FDA label data.
