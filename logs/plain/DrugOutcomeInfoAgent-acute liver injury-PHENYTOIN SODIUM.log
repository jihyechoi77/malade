CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant 
medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction 
with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have 
been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such 
as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 
Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or 
lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued 
if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin 
hypersensitivity  . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., 
trimethadione) in these same patients. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or 
immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. 
These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and 
eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately 
discontinued and not re-administered. 5. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association 
with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a 
number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and 
Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph 
node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS . PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation 
for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue 
irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as 
“purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The 
syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as 
fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be 
administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile 
saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity
of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or
Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin 
serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should 
be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Increased 
frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail 
and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with 
other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased 
levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before 
delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 
Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce 
confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute 
toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion  
Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus  Serious Dermatologic Reactions  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity  Hypersensitivity  
Hepatic Injury  Hematopoietic Complications  Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome)  Exacerbation of Porphyria  Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn  Hyperglycemia  The following 
adverse reactions associated with the use of Phenytoin Sodium Injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population
of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the 
intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
adverse_reactions: The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients 
. Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS  have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. 
There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and 
fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Severe complications are most commonly encountered in
elderly or critically ill patients  . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure  , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. 
Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin  . These have included thrombocytopenia, 
leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to 
folic acid therapy. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease have been reported . Laboratory Test 
Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of 
clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose , alkaline phosphatase, 
and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. PHENYTOIN 
SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor 
twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those 
induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use  . A 
predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Sk in and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever 
have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pharmacokinetics: Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after 
intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug 
is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific 
Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). 
PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pharmacokinetics: Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required . S e x /Race: Gender and race have no 
significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has 
been reported. P regnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the
level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. 
PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pharmacokinetics: Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes  .
