CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Dialysis does not alter serum half-life and
thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdosage.         
SOURCE:DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE label


CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degree. They are concentrated by the liver in 
the bile, and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form. Doxycycline is virtually completely absorbed after oral administration. Following a 200 mg dose,
normal adult volunteers averaged peak serum levels of 2.6 mcg/mL of doxycycline at 2 hours, decreasing to 1.45 mcg/mL at 24 hours. Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40%/72 hours in 
individuals with normal function (creatinine clearance about 75 mL/min.). This percentage excretion may fall as low as 1-5%/72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine 
clearance below 10 mL/min.). DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: clinical_pharmacology: Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18-22 hours) in individuals with normal 
and severely impaired renal function. Hemodialysis does not alter serum half-life. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta and are found in fetal tissues. Population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 pediatric patients (2-18 years of age) showed that allometrically
-scaled clearance (CL) of doxycycline in pediatric patients ≥2 to ≤8 years of age (median  3.58 [2.27-10.82] L/h/70 kg, N =11) did not differ significantly from pediatric patients >8 to 18 years of 
age (3 .27 [1.11-8.12] L/h/70 kg, N=33). DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: clinical_pharmacology: For pediatric patients weighing ≤45 kg, body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those ≥2 to ≤8 years of age 
(median  0.071 [0 .041-0.202] L/kg/h, N=10) did not differ significantly from those >8 to 18 years of age (0.081 [0.035-0.126] L/kg/h, N=8). In pediatric patients weighing >45 kg, no clinically 
significant differences in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those ≥2 to ≤8 years (0.050 L/kg/h, N=l) and those >8 to 18 years of age (0.044 [0.014-0.121] L/kg/h, N=25). 
DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: clinical_pharmacology: No clinically significant difference in CL between oral and IV dosing was observed in the small cohort of pediatric patients who received the oral (N=19) or
IV (N=21) formulation alone. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Doxycycline has bacteriostatic activity against 
a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Resistance Cross resistance with other tetracyclines is common. Antimicrobial Activity Doxycycline has been shown to be active against most 
isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the package insert for doxycycline hyclate tablets, USP.

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .) If severe skin reactions occur, doxycycline should be discontinued 
immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline. Clinical 
manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at 
greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause 
pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt 
ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize. All tetracyclines form a 
stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown 
to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing 
fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Evidence of embryotoxicity has also been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline 
is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines 
may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated 
sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with 
tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.

ANSWER: Doxycycline Hyclate does not appear to increase the risk of renal failure. In fact, studies indicate that there is no significant difference in the serum half-life of doxycycline in 
individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function. Additionally, the antianabolic action of the tetracyclines, which includes doxycycline, may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN), but this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler responded that DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE does not appear to increase the risk of renal failure. Studies indicate that there is no significant difference in the serum half-life of doxycycline 
in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function. Additionally, the antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), but this does not occur 
with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.
3. The information is sourced from the DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE label.
        -----
        Final answer: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE does not appear to increase the risk of renal failure. In patients with impaired renal function, the use of doxycycline does not result in an increased blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN), which suggests that it does not adversely affect renal function.

DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE does not appear to increase the risk of renal failure. According to the information provided by FDAHandler, which is sourced from the DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE label, studies indicate 
that there is no significant difference in the serum half-life of doxycycline in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function. Additionally, while the antianabolic action of the 
tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, it suggests that doxycycline does
not adversely affect renal function.
