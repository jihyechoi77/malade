CONTENT: DOXEPIN HCL: boxed_warning: Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behaviour (suicidality) in children, 
adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of doxepin or any other antidepressant in a child, 
adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults 
beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with 
increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual 
changes in behavior. DOXEPIN HCL: boxed_warning: Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Doxepin is not approved for use in 
pediatric patients. DOXEPIN HCL: boxed_warning: (See WARNINGS: CLINICAL WORSENING AND SUICIDE RISK, PRECAUTIONS: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS, and PRECAUTIONS: PEDIATRIC USE)

or Actions Read the Medication Guide that comes with you or your family member’s antidepressant medicine. This Medication Guide is only about the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions with 
antidepressant medicines. Talk to your, or your family member’s, healthcare provider about: all risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines all treatment choices for depression or 
other serious mental illness What is the most important information I should know about antidepressant medicines, depression and other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions? 1. 
Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. 2. Depression and other serious mental 
illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. DOXEPIN HCL: spl_medguide: Some people may have a particularly high risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include
people who have (or have a family history of) bipolar illness (also called manic-depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions. 3. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and 
actions in myself or a family member? Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine 
is started or when the dose is changed. Call the healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with the healthcare 
provider as scheduled. Call the healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms. DOXEPIN HCL: spl_medguide: Call a healthcare provider right away if you or
your family member has any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempts to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse 
anxiety feeling very agitated or restless panic attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) new or worse irritability acting aggressive, being angry, or violent acting on dangerous impulses an extreme

CONTENT: DOXEPIN HCL: warnings: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the 
emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant 
remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long-standing 
concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of
short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and 
young adults (ages 18-24) with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. DOXEPIN HCL: warnings: Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with 
antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled 
trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4400 
patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 
antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs 
studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. DOXEPIN HCL: warnings: The risk differences (drug vs placebo), 
however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1000 patients treated) are provided 
in Table 1. Table 1 Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Cases of Suicidality per 1000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 14 additional cases 18-24 5 additional cases 
Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 1 fewer case ≥65 6 fewer cases No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to 
reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. DOXEPIN HCL: warnings: However, there is 
substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression. All patients being treated with 
antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months
of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, 
impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as 
for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. DOXEPIN HCL: warnings: Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the 
emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic
regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to 
worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. DOXEPIN HCL: warnings: Families and caregivers of 
patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the 
emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health 
care providers Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for doxepin should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good 
patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally 
believed (though not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at 
risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. DOXEPIN HCL: warnings: However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, 
patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family 
history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that doxepin is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. Angle-Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs
following use of many antidepressant drugs including doxepin may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Usage in 
Geriatrics: The use of doxepin on a once-a-day dosage regimen in geriatric patients should be adjusted carefully based on the patient’s condition (see PRECAUTIONS−GERIATRIC USE). Usage in Pregnancy: 
Reproduction studies have been performed in rats, rabbits, monkeys and dogs and there was no evidence of harm to the animal fetus. DOXEPIN HCL: warnings: The relevance to humans is not known. Since 
there is no experience in pregnant women who have received this drug, safety in pregnancy has not been established. There has been a report of apnea and drowsiness occurring in a nursing infant whose 
mother was taking doxepin. Usage in Children: The use of doxepin in children under 12 years of age is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established.

CONTENT: DOXEPIN HCL: precautions: Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks 
associated with treatment with doxepin and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about “Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious Mental Illness, and 
Suicidal Thoughts or Actions” is available for doxepin. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should 
assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete 
text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking doxepin. 
DOXEPIN HCL: precautions: Patients should be advised that taking doxepin hydrochloride capsules can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of 
angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle-closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is 
not a risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they
are susceptible. DOXEPIN HCL: precautions: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, 
panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and 
suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such 
symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or 
were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and
possibly changes in the medication. DOXEPIN HCL: precautions: Drug Interactions: Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6: The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 
(debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7%–10% of Caucasians are so-called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 
isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given 
usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA). In addition, 
certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. DOXEPIN HCL: precautions: An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become 
abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) 
and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may 
pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. DOXEPIN HCL: precautions: Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of 
TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from 
fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary). Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 
2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased
dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6. 
DOXEPIN HCL: precautions: Doxepin is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 (with CYP1A2 & CYP3A4 as minor pathways). Inhibitors or substrates of CYP2D6 (i.e., quinidine, selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors [SSRIs]) may increase the plasma concentration of doxepin when administered concomitantly. The extent of interaction depends on the variability of effect on CYP2D6. The clinical 
significance of this interaction with doxepin has not been systematically evaluated. MAO Inhibitors: Serious side effects and even death have been reported following the concomitant use of certain 
drugs with MAO inhibitors. Therefore, MAO inhibitors should be discontinued at least two weeks prior to the cautious initiation of therapy with doxepin. The exact length of time may vary and is 
dependent upon the particular MAO inhibitor being used, the length of time it has been administered, and the dosage involved. DOXEPIN HCL: precautions: Cimetidine: Cimetidine has been reported to 
produce clinically significant fluctuations in steady-state serum concentrations of various tricyclic antidepressants. Serious anticholinergic symptoms (i.e., severe dry mouth, urinary retention and 
blurred vision) have been associated with elevations in the serum levels of tricyclic antidepressant when cimetidine therapy is initiated. Additionally, higher than expected tricyclic antidepressant 
levels have been observed when they are begun in patients already taking cimetidine. In patients who have been reported to be well controlled on tricyclic antidepressants receiving concurrent 
cimetidine therapy, discontinuation of cimetidine has been reported to decrease established steady-state serum tricyclic antidepressant levels and compromise their therapeutic effects. Alcohol: It 
should be borne in mind that alcohol ingestion may increase the danger inherent in any intentional or unintentional doxepin overdosage. This is especially important in patients who may use alcohol 
excessively. DOXEPIN HCL: precautions: Tolazamide: A case of severe hypoglycemia has been reported in a type II diabetic patient maintained on tolazamide (1 gm/day) 11 days after the addition of 
doxepin (75 mg/day). Drowsiness: Since drowsiness may occur with the use of this drug, patients should be warned of the possibility and cautioned against driving a car or operating dangerous machinery
while taking the drug. Patients should also be cautioned that their response to alcohol may be potentiated. Sedating drugs may cause confusion and oversedation in the elderly; elderly patients 
generally should be started on low doses of doxepin and observed closely. (See PRECAUTIONS−GERIATRIC USE.) Suicide: Since suicide is an inherent risk in any depressed patient and may remain so until 
significant improvement has occurred, patients should be closely supervised during the early course of therapy. Prescriptions should be written for the smallest feasible amount. DOXEPIN HCL: 
precautions: Psychosis: Should increased symptoms of psychosis or shift to manic symptomatology occur, it may be necessary to reduce dosage or add a major tranquilizer to the dosage regimen. Pediatric
Use-Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established (see BOX WARNING and WARNINGS—Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk). Anyone considering the use of doxepin in a child 
or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need. Geriatric Use: A determination has not been made whether controlled clinical studies of doxepin included sufficient numbers of 
subjects aged 65 and over to define a difference in response from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger 
patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or 
cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. DOXEPIN HCL: precautions: The extent of renal excretion of doxepin has not been determined. Because elderly patients are more likely
to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selections. Sedating drugs may cause confusion and oversedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses
of doxepin and observed closely. (See WARNINGS.

CONTENT: DOXEPIN HCL: adverse_reactions: NOTE: Some of the adverse reactions noted below have not been specifically reported with doxepin use. However, due to the close pharmacological similarities 
among the tricyclics, the reactions should be considered when prescribing doxepin hydrochloride. Anticholinergic Effects: Dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention have been 
reported. If they do not subside with continued therapy, or become severe, it may be necessary to reduce the dosage. Central Nervous System Effects: Drowsiness is the most commonly noticed side 
effect. This tends to disappear as therapy is continued. Other infrequently reported CNS side effects are confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, numbness, paresthesias, ataxia, extrapyramidal 
symptoms, seizures, tardive dyskinesia, and tremor. Cardiovascular: Cardiovascular effects including hypotension, hypertension, and tachycardia have been reported occasionally. DOXEPIN HCL: 
adverse_reactions: Allergic: Skin rash, edema, photosensitization, and pruritus have occasionally occurred. Hematologic: Eosinophilia has been reported in a few patients. There have been occasional 
reports of bone marrow depression manifesting as agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and purpura. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, indigestion, taste disturbances, diarrhea, anorexia, 
and aphthous stomatitis have been reported. (See ANTICHOLINERGIC EFFECTS.) Endocrine: Raised or lowered libido, testicular swelling, gynecomastia in males, enlargement of breasts and galactorrhea in 
the female, raising or lowering of blood sugar levels, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion have been reported with tricyclic administration. DOXEPIN HCL: adverse_reactions: 
Other: Dizziness, tinnitus, weight gain, sweating, chills, fatigue, weakness, flushing, jaundice, alopecia, headache, exacerbation of asthma, angle closure glaucoma, mydriasis and hyperpyrexia (in 
association with chlorpromazine) have been occasionally observed as adverse effects. Withdrawal Symptoms: The possibility of development of withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt cessation of treatment after
prolonged doxepin administration should be borne in mind. These are not indicative of addiction and gradual withdrawal of medication should not cause these symptoms. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE 
REACTIONS, contact Ajanta Pharma USA Inc. at 1-855-664-7744 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether DOXEPIN HCL increases the risk of aplastic anemia.
2. FDAHandler responded that the label for DOXEPIN HCL mentions hematologic adverse reactions, including bone marrow depression manifesting as agranulocytosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and

        -----
        Final answer: The FDA label for DOXEPIN HCL does not specifically list aplastic anemia as a known risk or side effect. While hematologic adverse reactions are mentioned, including bone marrow 
depression, aplastic anemia is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated based on the FDA label whether DOXEPIN HCL increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.

The FDA label for DOXEPIN HCL does not specifically list aplastic anemia as a known risk or side effect. While hematologic adverse reactions are mentioned, including bone marrow depression, aplastic 
anemia is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be definitively stated based on the FDA label whether DOXEPIN HCL increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.
