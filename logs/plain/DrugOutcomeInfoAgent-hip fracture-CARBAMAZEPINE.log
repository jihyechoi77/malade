        -----
        
CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: When used concomitantly with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment of these agents may be necessary: 
When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be doubled. Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. If carbamazepine is later withdrawn, the 
aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When carbamazepine is used with tacrolimus, monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are recommended. The use of 
concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine should be avoided with temsirolimus. If patients must be coadministered carbamazepine with temsirolimus, an adjustment of temsirolimus dosage 
should be considered. The use of carbamazepine with lapatinib should generally be avoided. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: If carbamazepine is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose
of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up. If carbamazepine is discontinued, the lapatinib dose should be reduced. Concomitant use of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in plasma concentrations 
of nefazodone and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monitor 
concentrations of valproate when carbamazepine extended-release capsules are introduced or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In addition, carbamazepine 
causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of, for example, the following drugs, for which monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment may be necessary: Acetaminophen, albendazole, 
alprazolam, aprepitant, buprenorphine, apixaban( 6 ), bupropion, buspirone, citalopram, clobazam, clonazepam, clozapine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone), cyclosporin, dabigatran( 6 
), delavirdine, desipramine, diazepam, dicumarol, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: felodipine), doxycycline, edoxaban( 6 ), eslicarbazepine, 
ethosuximide, everolimus, felbamate, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, levothyroxine, lorazepam, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, olanzapine,
oral and other hormonal contraceptives( 2 ), oxcarbazepine, paliperidone, phenytoin( 3 ), praziquantel, protease inhibitors, quetiapine, risperidone, rivaroxaban( 6 ), sertraline, sirolimus, 
tadalafil, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, triazolam, trazodone CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ( 4 ), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), 
valproate, warfarin (5) , ziprasidone, and zonisamide. ( 2 ) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may 
render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be decreased. Breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancies have been reported with carbamazepine. 
Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered. ( 3 ) Phenytoin has also been reported to increase in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels
following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ( 4 ) Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, 
carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine ) by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values. (5) Warfarinâ€™s anticoagulant 
effect can be reduced in the presence of carbamazepine. (6) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban (direct acting oral anticoagulants) is expected to 
result in decreased plasma concentrations of these anticoagulants that may be insufficient to achieve the intended therapeutic effect. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In general, coadministration of
carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban should be avoided. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a 
course of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary. Agents with Increased Levels in the 
Presence of Carbamazepine Carbamazepine extended-release capsules increase the plasma levels of the following agents. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in 
this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin( 7 ), and Primidone Carbamazepine extended-release capsules can increase the concentrations of clomipramine, phenytoin, and primidone. If 
a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of these agents in this category, and then begins treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it may be necessary to decrease the dose
of these drugs. ( 7 )Phenytoin has also been reported to decrease in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised.
Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide is an inactive prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite in part by CYP3A. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic 
activity of cyclophosphamide are reportedly increased by chronic co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers. There is a potential for increased cyclophosphamide toxicity when coadministered with 
carbamazepine. Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Carbamazepine: Delavirdine Coadministration of carbamazepine with delavirdine may lead to loss of virologic response and possible 
resistance to delavirdine or to the class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Lithium Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the 
risk of neurotoxic side effects. Thyroid Effects with Other Anticonvulsant Medications Alterations of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. Suicidal Behavior and Ideation 
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including carbamazepine extended-release capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated 
with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 
placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 
95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated
incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case
of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to 
allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted
for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. 
The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action 
and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table
1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 - Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 
Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 
Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: 9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in 
clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone 
considering prescribing carbamazepine extended-release capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other 
illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge 
during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Hyponatremia, 
Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion, and Water Intoxication Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In many cases, this 
hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with carbamazepine treatment may be dose-related. Elderly 
patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty 
concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Consider discontinuing carbamazepine extended-release capsules in patients with symptomatic 
hyponatremia. Usage in Pregnancy Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: Genitourinary System : Urinary frequency, acute urinary retention, oliguria with elevated blood pressure, azotemia, renal failure, and impotence. 
Albuminuria, glycosuria, elevated BUN, and microscopic deposits in the urine have also been reported. There have been rare reports of impaired male fertility and/or abnormal spermatogenesis. 
Testicular atrophy occurred in rats receiving carbamazepine orally from 4 to 52 weeks at dosage levels of 50 to 400 mg/kg/day. Additionally, rats receiving carbamazepine in the diet for 2 years at 
dosage levels of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg/day had a dose-related incidence of testicular atrophy and aspermatogenesis. In dogs, it produced a brownish discoloration, presumably a metabolite, in the 
urinary bladder at dosage levels of 50 mg/kg/day and higher. Relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: Nervous System : Dizziness, drowsiness, disturbances of
coordination, confusion, headache, fatigue, blurred vision, visual hallucinations, transient diplopia, oculomotor disturbances, nystagmus, speech disturbances, abnormal involuntary movements, 
peripheral neuritis and paresthesias, depression with agitation, talkativeness, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. There have been reports of associated paralysis and other symptoms of cerebral arterial 
insufficiency, but the exact relationship of these reactions to the drug has not been established. Isolated cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with concomitant use of 
psychotropic drugs. Digestive System : Nausea, vomiting, gastric distress and abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, and dryness of the mouth and pharynx, including glossitis and 
stomatitis. Eyes: Scattered punctate cortical lens opacities, as well as conjunctivitis, have been reported. CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: Although a direct causal relationship has not been 
established, many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes. Musculoskeletal System: Bone loss, aching joints and muscles, and leg cramps. Metabolism : Fever and chills, 
decreased levels of plasma calcium leading to osteoporosis, and hyperammonemia have been reported. Other: Isolated cases of a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome have been reported. There have been 
occasional reports of elevated levels of cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in patients taking anticonvulsants. A case of aseptic meningitis, accompanied by myoclonus and peripheral 
eosinophilia, has been reported in a patient taking carbamazepine in combination with other medications. The patient was successfully dechallenged, and the meningitis reappeared upon rechallenge with 
carbamazepine.

incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case
of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to 
allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted
for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. 
The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action 
and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table
1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 - Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 
Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 
Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: 9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in 
clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone 
considering prescribing carbamazepine extended-release capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other 
illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge 
during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Hyponatremia, 
Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion, and Water Intoxication Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In many cases, this 
hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with carbamazepine treatment may be dose-related. Elderly 
patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty 
concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can lead to falls. Consider discontinuing carbamazepine extended-release capsules in patients with symptomatic 
hyponatremia. Usage in Pregnancy Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: WARNINGS Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk 
in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not 
drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 Allele 
Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of
an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in 
allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity. Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, 
Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, 
averaging 2 to 4%, but higher in some groups. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: HLA-B*1502 is present in <1% of the population in Japan and Korea. HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian 
origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans). Prior to initiating carbamazepine extended-release capsules therapy, testing for HLA-B*1502 should be performed in 
patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA-B*1502 may be present. In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, 
keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. 
Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Tested patients who are found to
be negative for the allele are thought to have a low risk of SJS/TEN (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS/Laboratory Tests ). Over 90% of carbamazepine treated patients who will experience SJS/TEN have this 
reaction within the first few months of treatment. This information may be taken into consideration in determining the need for screening of genetically at-risk patients currently on carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules. The HLA-B*1502 allele has not been found to predict risk of less severe adverse cutaneous reactions from carbamazepine, such as maculopapular eruption [MPE] or to predict 
Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of 
Chinese ancestry taking other anti-epileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 
positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable. Patients should be made aware that carbamazepine extended-release capsules contain carbamazepine and should not be used 
in combination with any other medications containing carbamazepine. Hypersensitivity Reactions and HLA-A*3101 Allele Retrospective case-control studies in patients of European, Korean, and Japanese 
ancestry have found a moderate association between the risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions and the presence of HLA-A*3101, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-A gene, in patients using 
carbamazepine. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: These hypersensitivity reactions include SJS/TEN, maculopapular eruptions, and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (see DRESS/Multiorgan 
hypersensitivity below). HLA-A*3101 is expected to be carried by more than 15% of patients of Japanese, Native American, Southern Indian (e.g., Tamil Nadu) and some Arabic ancestry; up to about 10% in
patients of Han Chinese, Korean, European, Latin American and other Indian ancestry; and up to about 5% in African-Americans and patients of Thai, Taiwanese, and Chinese (Hong Kong) ancestry. The 
risks and benefits of carbamazepine therapy should be weighed before considering carbamazepine in patients known to be positive for HLA-A*3101. General Information on HLA Genotyping and 
Hypersensitivity Application of HLA genotyping as a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. CARBAMAZEPINE: 
warnings: Many HLA-B*1502-positive and HLA-A*3101-positive patients treated with carbamazepine will not develop SJS/TEN or other hypersensitivity reactions, and these reactions can still occur 
infrequently in HLA-B*1502-negative and HLA-A*3101-negative patients of any ethnicity. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN and other hypersensitivity 
reactions, such as AED dose, compliance, concomitant medications, co-morbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. Aplastic Anemia and Agranulocytosis Aplastic anemia 
and agranulocytosis have been reported in association with the use of carbamazepine. (See BOXED WARNING .) Patients with a history of adverse hematologic reaction to any drug may be particularly at 
risk of bone marrow depression.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication 
Guide before taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of 
liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Patients should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, they must report any occurrence immediately to
their physicians. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use. CARBAMAZEPINE: 
information_for_patients: Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In the event a skin reaction should 
occur while taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS ). Patients should be advised that anaphylactic reactions and 
angioedema may occur during treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients to immediately report signs and symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the 
face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their healthcare provider. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: 
Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including carbamazepine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert 
for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern 
should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use 
of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products. Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive 
sedative effect. Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of 
antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 (see Warnings-Usage in Pregnancy ). If necessary, the carbamazepine extended-release capsules can
be opened and the contents sprinkled over food, such as a teaspoon of applesauce or other similar food products. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules or their contents should not be crushed or 
chewed. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use of any other prescription or non-prescription 
medication or herbal products. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide, and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide prior 
to taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: See FDA approved Medication Guide.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In controlled clinical trials, carbamazepine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of psychomotor and grand mal seizures,
as well as trigeminal neuralgia. Mechanism of Action Carbamazepine has demonstrated anticonvulsant properties in rats and mice with electrically and chemically induced seizures. It appears to act by 
reducing polysynaptic responses and blocking the post-tetanic potentiation. Carbamazepine greatly reduces or abolishes pain induced by stimulation of the infraorbital nerve in cats and rats. It 
depresses thalamic potential and bulbar and polysynaptic reflexes, including the linguomandibular reflex in cats. Carbamazepine is chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants or other drugs used to 
control the pain of trigeminal neuralgia. The mechanism of action remains unknown. CARBAMAZEPINE: clinical_pharmacology: The principal metabolite of carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide, has 
anticonvulsant activity as demonstrated in several in vivo animal models of seizures. Though clinical activity for the epoxide has been postulated, the significance of its activity with respect to the
safety and efficacy of carbamazepine has not been established. Pharmacokinetics Carbamazepine (CBZ): Taken every 12 hours, carbamazepine extended-release capsules provide steady state plasma levels 
comparable to immediate-release carbamazepine tablets given every 6 hours, when administered at the same total mg daily dose. Following a single 200 mg oral extended-release dose of carbamazepine, 
peak plasma concentration was 1.9 Â± 0.3 mcg/mL and the time to reach the peak was 19 Â± 7 hours. CARBAMAZEPINE: clinical_pharmacology: Following chronic administration (800 mg every 12 hours), the peak
levels were 11.0 Â± 2.5 mcg/mL and the time to reach the peak was 5.9 Â± 1.8 hours. The pharmacokinetics of extended-release carbamazepine is linear over the single dose range of 200 to 800 mg. 
Carbamazepine is 76% bound to plasma proteins. Carbamazepine is primarily metabolized in the liver. Cytochrome P450 3A4 was identified as the major isoform responsible for the formation of 
carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide. Since carbamazepine induces its own metabolism, the half-life is also variable. Following a single extended-release dose of carbamazepine, the average half-life range 
from 35 to 40 hours and 12 to 17 hours on repeated dosing. CARBAMAZEPINE: clinical_pharmacology: The apparent oral clearance following a single dose was 25 Â± 5 mL/min and following multiple dosing was
80 Â± 30 mL/min. After oral administration of 14 C-carbamazepine, 72% of the administered radioactivity was found in the urine and 28% in the feces. This urinary radioactivity was composed largely of 
hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites, with only 3% of unchanged carbamazepine. Carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide (CBZ-E): Carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide is considered to be an active metabolite of 
carbamazepine. Following a single 200 mg oral extended-release dose of carbamazepine, the peak plasma concentration of carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide was 0.11 Â± 0. CARBAMAZEPINE: clinical_pharmacology: 
012 mcg/mL and the time to reach the peak was 36 Â± 6 hours. Following chronic administration of an extended-release dose of carbamazepine (800 mg every 12 hours), the peak levels of carbamazepine-10, 
11-epoxide were 2.2 Â± 0.9 mcg/mL and the time to reach the peak was 14 Â± 8 hours. The plasma half-life of carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide following administration of carbamazepine is 34 Â± 9 hours. 
Following a single oral dose of extended-release carbamazepine (200 to 800 mg) the AUC and C max of carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide were less than 10% of carbamazepine.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients 
was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four 
suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal 
thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the 
analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs
in the data analyzed. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used
for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 
- Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of 
Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.
CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: 9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other 
conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing carbamazepine extended-release capsules or any other AED must 
balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and 
mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these 
symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Hyponatremia, Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion, and Water Intoxication 
Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic 
hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with carbamazepine treatment may be dose-related. Elderly patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing 
hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can 
lead to falls. Consider discontinuing carbamazepine extended-release capsules in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia. Usage in Pregnancy Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including spina 
bifida. There have also been reports that associate carbamazepine with developmental disorders and congenital anomalies (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, and anomalies 
involving various body systems). Developmental delays have been reported. When treating or counseling women of childbearing potential, the prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of 
therapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. 
Retrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. 
Therefore, if therapy is to be continued, monotherapy may be preferable for pregnant women.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: If carbamazepine is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up. If carbamazepine is discontinued, 
the lapatinib dose should be reduced. Concomitant use of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic 
effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monitor concentrations of valproate when carbamazepine extended-release capsules are introduced 
or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In addition, carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of, for example, the following drugs,
for which monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment may be necessary: Acetaminophen, albendazole, alprazolam, aprepitant, buprenorphine, apixaban( 6 ), bupropion, buspirone, citalopram, 
clobazam, clonazepam, clozapine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone), cyclosporin, dabigatran( 6 ), delavirdine, desipramine, diazepam, dicumarol, dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: felodipine), doxycycline, edoxaban( 6 ), eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, everolimus, felbamate, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, 
levothyroxine, lorazepam, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives( 2 ), oxcarbazepine, paliperidone, phenytoin( 3
), praziquantel, protease inhibitors, quetiapine, risperidone, rivaroxaban( 6 ), sertraline, sirolimus, tadalafil, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, triazolam, trazodone CARBAMAZEPINE: 
drug_interactions: ( 4 ), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin (5) , ziprasidone, and zonisamide. ( 2 ) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with
hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be 
decreased. Breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancies have been reported with carbamazepine. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered. ( 3 ) Phenytoin has also been 
reported to increase in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ( 4 ) 
Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine )
by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values. (5) Warfarinâ€™s anticoagulant effect can be reduced in the presence of carbamazepine. (6) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban (direct acting oral anticoagulants) is expected to result in decreased plasma concentrations of these anticoagulants that may be insufficient to achieve
the intended therapeutic effect. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In general, coadministration of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban should be avoided. Thus, if a 
patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that 
a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary. Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine Carbamazepine extended-release capsules increase the plasma levels of the 
following agents. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules,
it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin( 7 ), and Primidone Carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules can increase the concentrations of clomipramine, phenytoin, and primidone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of these agents in this category, and then
begins treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these drugs. ( 7 )Phenytoin has also been reported to decrease in the presence of 
carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide is an inactive prodrug and is converted to its 
active metabolite in part by CYP3A. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide are reportedly increased by chronic co-administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers. There is a potential for increased cyclophosphamide toxicity when coadministered with carbamazepine. Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Carbamazepine: Delavirdine 
Coadministration of carbamazepine with delavirdine may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Lithium Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects. Thyroid Effects with Other Anticonvulsant Medications Alterations
of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: Genitourinary System : Urinary frequency, acute urinary retention, oliguria with elevated blood pressure, azotemia, renal failure, and impotence. 
Albuminuria, glycosuria, elevated BUN, and microscopic deposits in the urine have also been reported. There have been rare reports of impaired male fertility and/or abnormal spermatogenesis. 
Testicular atrophy occurred in rats receiving carbamazepine orally from 4 to 52 weeks at dosage levels of 50 to 400 mg/kg/day. Additionally, rats receiving carbamazepine in the diet for 2 years at 
dosage levels of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg/day had a dose-related incidence of testicular atrophy and aspermatogenesis. In dogs, it produced a brownish discoloration, presumably a metabolite, in the 
urinary bladder at dosage levels of 50 mg/kg/day and higher. Relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: Nervous System : Dizziness, drowsiness, disturbances of
coordination, confusion, headache, fatigue, blurred vision, visual hallucinations, transient diplopia, oculomotor disturbances, nystagmus, speech disturbances, abnormal involuntary movements, 
peripheral neuritis and paresthesias, depression with agitation, talkativeness, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. There have been reports of associated paralysis and other symptoms of cerebral arterial 
insufficiency, but the exact relationship of these reactions to the drug has not been established. Isolated cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with concomitant use of 
psychotropic drugs. Digestive System : Nausea, vomiting, gastric distress and abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, and dryness of the mouth and pharynx, including glossitis and 
stomatitis. Eyes: Scattered punctate cortical lens opacities, as well as conjunctivitis, have been reported. CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: Although a direct causal relationship has not been 
established, many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes. Musculoskeletal System: Bone loss, aching joints and muscles, and leg cramps. Metabolism : Fever and chills, 
decreased levels of plasma calcium leading to osteoporosis, and hyperammonemia have been reported. Other: Isolated cases of a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome have been reported. There have been 
occasional reports of elevated levels of cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in patients taking anticonvulsants. A case of aseptic meningitis, accompanied by myoclonus and peripheral 
eosinophilia, has been reported in a patient taking carbamazepine in combination with other medications. The patient was successfully dechallenged, and the meningitis reappeared upon rechallenge with 
carbamazepine.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: 9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or 
other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing carbamazepine extended-release capsules or any other AED 
must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and 
mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these 
symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Hyponatremia, Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion, and Water Intoxication 
Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic 
hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with carbamazepine treatment may be dose-related. Elderly patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing 
hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can 
lead to falls. Consider discontinuing carbamazepine extended-release capsules in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia. Usage in Pregnancy Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including spina 
bifida. There have also been reports that associate carbamazepine with developmental disorders and congenital anomalies (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, and anomalies 
involving various body systems). Developmental delays have been reported. When treating or counseling women of childbearing potential, the prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of 
therapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. 
Retrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. 
Therefore, if therapy is to be continued, monotherapy may be preferable for pregnant women. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: In humans, transplacental passage of carbamazepine is rapid (30 to 60 minutes), and
the drug is accumulated in the fetal tissues, with higher levels found in liver and kidney than in brain and lung. Carbamazepine has been shown to have adverse effects in reproduction studies in rats 
when given orally in dosages 10 to 25 times the maximum human daily dosage (MHDD) of 1,200 mg on a mg/kg basis or 1.5 to 4 times the MHDD on a mg/m 2 basis. In rat teratology studies, 2 of 135 
offspring showed kinked ribs at 250 mg/kg and 4 of 119 offspring at 650 mg/kg showed other anomalies (cleft palate, 1; talipes, 1; anophthalmos, 2). CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: In reproduction studies in
rats, nursing offspring demonstrated a lack of weight gain and an unkempt appearance at a maternal dosage level of 200 mg/kg. Antiepileptic drugs should not be discontinued abruptly in patients in 
whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life. In individual cases where the 
severity and frequency of the seizure disorder are such that removal of medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation of the drug may be considered prior to and during 
pregnancy, although it cannot be said with any confidence that even minor seizures do not pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus. Tests to detect defects using current accepted procedures 
should be considered a part of routine prenatal care in childbearing women receiving carbamazepine.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: CNS depressants include: alcohol, opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, sedative/hypnotics, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, 
antihistamines, anticholinergics, alpha and beta blockers, general anesthetics, muscle relaxants, and illicit CNS depressants. Consider reducing the dose of CNS depressants or carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules when using these drugs concomitantly. Because of its primary CNS effect, caution should be used when carbamazepine extended-release capsules are taken with other centrally 
acting drugs and alcohol. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium and 
cisatracurium has occurred in patients chronically administered carbamazepine. CARBAMAZEPINE: precautions: Whether or not carbamazepine has the same effect on other nondepolarizing agents is unknown. 
Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of 
Fertility: Administration of carbamazepine to Sprague-Dawley rats for two years in the diet at doses of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg/day (low dose approximately 0.2 times the maximum human daily dose of 
1,200 mg on a mg/m 2 basis), resulted in a dose-related increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors in females and of benign interstitial cell adenomas in the testes of males. Carbamazepine 
must, therefore, be considered to be carcinogenic in Sprague-Dawley rats. Bacterial and mammalian mutagenicity studies using carbamazepine produced negative results. CARBAMAZEPINE: precautions: The 
significance of these findings relative to the use of carbamazepine in humans is, at present, unknown. Usage in Pregnancy (See WARNINGS ) Labor and Delivery The effect of carbamazepine on human labor 
and delivery is unknown. Nursing Mothers Carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite are transferred to breast milk and during lactation. The concentrations of carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite 
are approximately 50% of the maternal plasma concentration. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from carbamazepine, a decision should be made whether to 
discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. CARBAMAZEPINE: pediatric_use: Pediatric Use Substantial evidence of carbamazepine 
effectiveness for use in the management of children with epilepsy (see INDICATIONS for specific seizure types) is derived from clinical investigations performed in adults and from studies in several 
in vitro systems which support the conclusion that (1) the pathogenic mechanisms underlying seizure propagation are essentially identical in adults and children, and (2) the mechanism of action of 
carbamazepine in treating seizures is essentially identical in adults and children. Taken as a whole, this information supports a conclusion that the generally acceptable therapeutic range of total 
carbamazepine in plasma (i.e., 4 to 12 mcg/mL) is the same in children and adults. The evidence assembled was primarily obtained from short-term use of carbamazepine. The safety of carbamazepine in 
children has been systematically studied up to 6 months. No longer term data from clinical trials is available. CARBAMAZEPINE: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use No systematic studies in geriatric patients 
have been conducted.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: If carbamazepine is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up. If carbamazepine is discontinued, 
the lapatinib dose should be reduced. Concomitant use of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic 
effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monitor concentrations of valproate when carbamazepine extended-release capsules are introduced 
or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In addition, carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of, for example, the following drugs,
for which monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment may be necessary: Acetaminophen, albendazole, alprazolam, aprepitant, buprenorphine, apixaban( 6 ), bupropion, buspirone, citalopram, 
clobazam, clonazepam, clozapine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone), cyclosporin, dabigatran( 6 ), delavirdine, desipramine, diazepam, dicumarol, dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: felodipine), doxycycline, edoxaban( 6 ), eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, everolimus, felbamate, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, 
levothyroxine, lorazepam, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives( 2 ), oxcarbazepine, paliperidone, phenytoin( 3
), praziquantel, protease inhibitors, quetiapine, risperidone, rivaroxaban( 6 ), sertraline, sirolimus, tadalafil, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, triazolam, trazodone CARBAMAZEPINE: 
drug_interactions: ( 4 ), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin (5) , ziprasidone, and zonisamide. ( 2 ) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with
hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be 
decreased. Breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancies have been reported with carbamazepine. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered. ( 3 ) Phenytoin has also been 
reported to increase in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ( 4 ) 
Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine )
by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values. (5) Warfarinâ€™s anticoagulant effect can be reduced in the presence of carbamazepine. (6) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban (direct acting oral anticoagulants) is expected to result in decreased plasma concentrations of these anticoagulants that may be insufficient to achieve
the intended therapeutic effect.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: HLA-B*1502 is present in <1% of the population in Japan and Korea. HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian origin (e.g., Caucasians, 
African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans). Prior to initiating carbamazepine extended-release capsules therapy, testing for HLA-B*1502 should be performed in patients with ancestry in 
populations in which HLA-B*1502 may be present. In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, keeping in mind the limitations
of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. Carbamazepine extended-release 
capsules should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Tested patients who are found to be negative for the allele are
thought to have a low risk of SJS/TEN (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS/Laboratory Tests ). Over 90% of carbamazepine treated patients who will experience SJS/TEN have this reaction within the first few 
months of treatment. This information may be taken into consideration in determining the need for screening of genetically at-risk patients currently on carbamazepine extended-release capsules. The 
HLA-B*1502 allele has not been found to predict risk of less severe adverse cutaneous reactions from carbamazepine, such as maculopapular eruption [MPE] or to predict Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia 
and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Chinese ancestry taking other 
anti-epileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 positive patients, when 
alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable. Patients should be made aware that carbamazepine extended-release capsules contain carbamazepine and should not be used in combination with any 
other medications containing carbamazepine. Hypersensitivity Reactions and HLA-A*3101 Allele Retrospective case-control studies in patients of European, Korean, and Japanese ancestry have found a 
moderate association between the risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions and the presence of HLA-A*3101, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-A gene, in patients using carbamazepine. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: These hypersensitivity reactions include SJS/TEN, maculopapular eruptions, and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (see DRESS/Multiorgan hypersensitivity 
below). HLA-A*3101 is expected to be carried by more than 15% of patients of Japanese, Native American, Southern Indian (e.g., Tamil Nadu) and some Arabic ancestry; up to about 10% in patients of Han 
Chinese, Korean, European, Latin American and other Indian ancestry; and up to about 5% in African-Americans and patients of Thai, Taiwanese, and Chinese (Hong Kong) ancestry. The risks and benefits 
of carbamazepine therapy should be weighed before considering carbamazepine in patients known to be positive for HLA-A*3101. General Information on HLA Genotyping and Hypersensitivity Application of 
HLA genotyping as a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Many HLA-B*1502-positive and 
HLA-A*3101-positive patients treated with carbamazepine will not develop SJS/TEN or other hypersensitivity reactions, and these reactions can still occur infrequently in HLA-B*1502-negative and 
HLA-A*3101-negative patients of any ethnicity. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN and other hypersensitivity reactions, such as AED dose, compliance,
concomitant medications, co-morbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. Aplastic Anemia and Agranulocytosis Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported in 
association with the use of carbamazepine. (See BOXED WARNING .) Patients with a history of adverse hematologic reaction to any drug may be particularly at risk of bone marrow depression.

ANSWER: The available information from the CARBAMAZEPINE label does not specifically mention an increased or decreased risk of hip fracture as an adverse reaction or warning associated with its use. 
However, the label does mention that carbamazepine can lead to bone loss and decreased levels of plasma calcium leading to osteoporosis, which could potentially increase the risk of fractures, 
including hip fractures.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether CARBAMAZEPINE has any known association with an increased or decreased risk of hip fracture.
2. FDAHandler responded that the CARBAMAZEPINE label does not specifically mention an increased or decreased risk of hip fracture. However, the label does mention that carbamazepine can lead to bone 
loss and decreased levels of plasma calcium leading to osteoporosis, which could potentially increase the risk of fractures, including hip fractures.
