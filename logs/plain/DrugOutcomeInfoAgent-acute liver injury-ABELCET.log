CONTENT: ABELCET: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate patients), 
of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 patients were 
treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with ABELCET ® , 9% 
discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient chills and/or fever 
during infusion of the drug. ABELCET: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14 Increased Serum Creatinine 11

CONTENT: ABELCET: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use: Forty-nine elderly patients, age 65 years or over, have been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, prospective,
single-arm study. No serious unexpected adverse events have been reported.

CONTENT: ABELCET: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General: As with any amphotericin B-containing product, during the initial dosing of ABELCET ® , the drug should be administered under close clinical 
observation by medically trained personnel. Acute reactions including fever and chills may occur 1 to 2 hours after starting an intravenous infusion of ABELCET ® . These reactions are usually more 
common with the first few doses of ABELCET ® and generally diminish with subsequent doses. Infusion has been rarely associated with hypotension, bronchospasm, arrhythmias, and shock. Laboratory Tests:
Serum creatinine should be monitored frequently during ABELCET ® therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). It is also advisable to regularly monitor liver function, serum electrolytes (particularly magnesium 
and potassium), and complete blood counts. Drug Interactions: No formal clinical studies of drug interactions have been conducted with ABELCET ® . ABELCET: precautions: However, when administered 
concomitantly, the following drugs are known to interact with amphotericin B; therefore, the following drugs may interact with ABELCET ® : Antineoplastic agents: Concurrent use of antineoplastic 
agents and amphotericin B may enhance the potential for renal toxicity, bronchospasm, and hypotension. Antineoplastic agents should be given concomitantly with ABELCET ® with great caution. 
Corticosteroids and corticotropin (ACTH): Concurrent use of corticosteroids and corticotropin (ACTH) with amphotericin B may potentiate hypokalemia which could predispose the patient to cardiac 
dysfunction. If used concomitantly with ABELCET ® , serum electrolytes and cardiac function should be closely monitored. ABELCET: drug_interactions: Cyclosporin A: Data from a prospective study of 
prophylactic ABELCET ® in 22 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation suggested that concurrent initiation of cyclosporin A and ABELCET ® within several days of bone marrow ablation may be 
associated with increased nephrotoxicity. Digitalis glycosides: Concurrent use of amphotericin B may induce hypokalemia and may potentiate digitalis toxicity. When administered concomitantly with 
ABELCET ® , serum potassium levels should be closely monitored. Flucytosine : Concurrent use of flucytosine with amphotericin B-containing preparations may increase the toxicity of flucytosine by 
possibly increasing its cellular uptake and/or impairing its renal excretion. Flucytosine should be given concomitantly with ABELCET ® with caution. Imidazoles (e.g.

CONTENT: ABELCET: warnings: WARNINGS Anaphylaxis has been reported with amphotericin B desoxycholate and other amphotericin B-containing drugs. Anaphylaxis has been reported with ABELCET ® with an 
incidence rate of <0.1%. If severe respiratory distress occurs, the infusion should be immediately discontinued. The patient should not receive further infusions of ABELCET ® .

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if ABELCET increases the risk of acute liver injury.
2. FDAHandler responded that ABELCET has been reported to cause acute liver failure, hepatitis, and jaundice among other gastrointestinal adverse events. However, the causal association between these 
adverse events and ABELCET is uncertain, and it is advisable to monitor liver function during ABELCET therapy.

ABELCET has been reported to cause acute liver failure, hepatitis, and jaundice, which are indicative of acute liver injury. However, the causal relationship between ABELCET and these adverse events 
is uncertain. Therefore, while there is a potential risk of acute liver injury with ABELCET, the degree of risk and the reliability of the association are not definitively established. Regular
