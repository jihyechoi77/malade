                Passages:
                1. Drug PHENYTOIN SODIUM: PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in newborns exposed to the drug in utero, due to a decrease in vitamin K-dependent clotting 
factors. This condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth.
2. Drug PHENYTOIN: Phenytoin may increase the risk of bleeding in newborns who were exposed to the drug in utero. This is associated with a bleeding disorder due to decreased levels of vitamin 
K-dependent clotting factors. The risk can be mitigated by administering vitamin K to the mother before delivery and to the newborn after birth.
3. Drug EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This increased risk is associated with a 
potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder due to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. The risk can be mitigated by administering vitamin K to the mother before delivery and 
to the neonate after birth. This information is sourced from the EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label.

                Does the phenytoin category of drugs increase the risk of
                bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the phenytoin category of drugs increase the risk of bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. All three passages discuss drugs within the phenytoin category and their effect on bleeding risk.
2. Passage 1 states that PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of bleeding due to a decrease in vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, particularly in newborns exposed in utero.
3. Passage 2 mentions that Phenytoin may increase the risk of bleeding in newborns exposed to the drug in utero, associated with decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.
4. Passage 3 indicates that EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of bleeding, also due to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in newborns exposed in utero.
5. All passages consistently report an increased risk of bleeding associated with the use of phenytoin drugs in newborns exposed in utero, which can be mitigated by vitamin K administration.
6. There is no mention of phenytoin decreasing the risk of bleeding or having no effect on bleeding risk.
        -----
        Final answer: The phenytoin category of drugs increases the risk of bleeding.
