CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Renal Impairment The systemic availability and half-life of metoprolol in patients with renal failure do not differ to a clinically significant degree 
from those in normal subjects. Hepatic Impairment Since the drug is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, hepatic impairment may impact the pharmacokinetics of metoprolol. The elimination 
half-life of metoprolol is considerably prolonged, depending on severity (up to 7.2 h). Clinical Studies Hypertension In controlled clinical studies, metoprolol has been shown to be an effective 
antihypertensive agent when used alone or as concomitant therapy with thiazide-type diuretics, at dosages of 100 to 450 mg daily. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: In controlled, comparative, 
clinical studies, metoprolol has been shown to be as effective an antihypertensive agent as propranolol, methyldopa, and thiazide-type diuretics, to be equally effective in supine and standing 
positions. Angina Pectoris In controlled clinical trials, metoprolol, administered two or four times daily, has been shown to be an effective antianginal agent, reducing the number of angina attacks 
and increasing exercise tolerance. The dosage used in these studies ranged from 100 to 400 mg daily. A controlled, comparative, clinical trial showed that metoprolol was indistinguishable from 
propranolol in the treatment of angina pectoris. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Myocardial Infarction In a large (1,395 patients randomized), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, 
metoprolol was shown to reduce 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized and treated as soon as possible after their arrival in 
the hospital, once their clinical condition had stabilized and their hemodynamic status had been carefully evaluated. Subjects were ineligible if they had hypotension, bradycardia, peripheral signs of
shock, and/or more than minimal basal rales as signs of congestive heart failure. Initial treatment consisted of intravenous followed by oral administration of metoprolol or placebo, given in a 
coronary care or comparable unit. Oral maintenance therapy with metoprolol or placebo was then continued for 3 months. After this double-blind period, all patients were given metoprolol and followed 
up to 1 year. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: The median delay from the onset of symptoms to the initiation of therapy was 8 hours in both the metoprolol- and placebo-treatment groups. Among 
patients treated with metoprolol, there were comparable reductions in 3-month mortality for those treated early (â‰¤8 hours) and those in whom treatment was started later. Significant reductions in the 
incidence of ventricular fibrillation and in chest pain following initial intravenous therapy were also observed with metoprolol and were independent of the interval between onset of symptoms and 
initiation of therapy. In this study, patients treated with metoprolol received the drug both very early (intra-venously) and during a subsequent 3-month period, while placebo patients received no 
beta-blocker treatment for this period. The study thus was able to show a benefit from the overall metoprolol regimen but cannot separate the benefit of very early intravenous treatment from the 
benefit of later beta-blocker therapy. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: pharmacokinetics: Nonetheless, because the overall regimen showed a clear beneficial effect on survival without evidence of an early adverse
effect on survival, one acceptable dosage regimen is the precise regimen used in the trial. Because the specific benefit of very early treatment remains to be defined however, it is also reasonable to
administer the drug orally to patients at a later time as is recommended for certain other beta-blockers.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to 
evaluate carcinogenic potential. In a 2-year study in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg per day, there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or 
malignant neoplasms of any type. The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli
and a slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. In a 21-month study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg per day, benign lung tumors (small adenomas) occurred more 
frequently in female mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors, or in the overall incidence of 
tumors or malignant tumors. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: This 21-month study was repeated in CD-1 mice, and no statistically or biologically 
significant differences were observed between treated and control mice of either sex for any type of tumor. All mutagenicity tests performed (a dominant lethal study in mice, chromosome studies in 
somatic cells, a Salmonella/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test, and a nucleus anomaly test in somatic interphase nuclei) were negative. Reproduction toxicity studies in mice, rats and rabbits did 
not indicate teratogenic potential for metoprolol tartrate. Embryotoxicity and/or fetotoxicity in rats and rabbits were noted starting at doses of 50 mg/kg in rats and 25 mg/kg in rabbits, as 
demonstrated by increases in preimplantation loss, decreases in the number of viable fetuses per dose, and/or decreases in neonatal survival. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: 
carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: High doses were associated with some maternal toxicity, and growth delay of the offspring in utero , which was reflected in minimally lower 
weights at birth. The oral NOAELs for embryo-fetal development in mice, rats, and rabbits were considered to be 25, 200, and 12.5 mg/kg. This corresponds to dose levels that are approximately 0.3, 4, 
and 0.5 times, respectively, when based on surface area, the maximum human oral dose (8 mg/kg/day) of metoprolol tartrate. Metoprolol tartrate has been associated with reversible adverse effects on 
spermatogenesis starting at oral dose levels of 3.5 mg/kg in rats (a dose that is only 0.1-times the human dose, when based on surface area), although other studies have shown no effect of metoprolol 
tartrate on reproductive performance in male rats.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Individualized the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken 
with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. Increase the dosage 
at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective 
dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: While once-daily dosing is 
effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period, and larger or more 
frequent daily doses may be required. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the
day. Beta 1 selectivity diminishes as the dose of metoprolol is increased. Angina Pectoris The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be 
taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until 
optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is pronounced slowing of the heart rate. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets 
is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, gradually decrease the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks (see WARNINGS ). 
Myocardial Infarction Early Treatment During the early phase of definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, initiate treatment with metoprolol tartrate tablets as soon as possible after the 
patient's arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patientâ€™s hemodynamic condition has stabilized. Begin treatment in this 
early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; give the injections at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous 
administration of metoprolol, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), 
initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose and continue for 48 hours. Thereafter, the maintenance dosage is 100 mg twice daily (see Late 
Treatment below). Start patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose on metoprolol tartrate tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 
minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition allows. In patients with severe intolerance, discontinue metoprolol tartrate tablets (see WARNINGS ). METOPROLOL 
TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: Late Treatment Start patients with contraindications to treatment during the early phase of suspected or definite myocardial infarction, patients who appear not to
tolerate the full early treatment, and patients in whom the physician wishes to delay therapy for any other reason on metoprolol tartrate tablets, 100 mg twice daily, as soon as their clinical 
condition allows. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest 
that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years. Special Populations Pediatric Patients : No pediatric studies have been performed. The safety and efficacy of metoprolol tartrate tablets in 
pediatric patients have not been established. Renal Impairment : No dose adjustment of metoprolol tartrate tablets is required in patients with renal impairment.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Metoprolol tartrate is a beta 1 -selective (cardioselective) adrenergic receptor blocker. This 
preferential effect is not absolute, however, and at higher plasma concentrations, metoprolol also inhibits beta 2 -adrenoreceptors, chiefly located in the bronchial and vascular musculature. Clinical
pharmacology studies have demonstrated the beta-blocking activity of metoprolol, as shown by (1) reduction in heart rate and cardiac output at rest and upon exercise, (2) reduction of systolic blood 
pressure upon exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia, and (4) reduction of reflex orthostatic tachycardia. Hypertension The mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of 
beta-blocking agents has not been fully elucidated. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: clinical_pharmacology: However, several possible mechanisms have been proposed: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at
peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output; (2) a central effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery; and (3) suppression of renin
activity. Angina Pectoris By blocking catecholamine-induced increases in heart rate, in velocity and extent of myocardial contraction, and in blood pressure, metoprolol reduces the oxygen requirements
of the heart at any given level of effort, thus making it useful in the long-term management of angina pectoris. Myocardial Infarction The precise mechanism of action of metoprolol in patients with 
suspected or definite myocardial infarction is not known. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: clinical_pharmacology: Pharmacodynamics Relative beta 1 selectivity is demonstrated by the following: (1) In healthy 
subjects, metoprolol is unable to reverse the beta 2 -mediated vasodilating effects of epinephrine. This contrasts with the effect of nonselective (beta 1 plus beta 2 ) beta-blockers, which completely
reverse the vasodilating effects of epinephrine. (2) In asthmatic patients, metoprolol reduces FEV 1 and FVC significantly less than a nonselective beta-blocker, propranolol, at equivalent beta 1 
-receptor blocking doses. Metoprolol has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, and membrane-stabilizing activity is detectable only at doses much greater than required for beta-blockade. Animal and 
human experiments indicate that metoprolol slows the sinus rate and decreases AV nodal conduction. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: clinical_pharmacology: Significant beta-blocking effect (as measured by 
reduction of exercise heart rate) occurs within 1 hour after oral administration, and its duration is dose-related. For example, a 50% reduction of the maximum effect after single oral doses of 20, 
50, and 100 mg occurred at 3.3, 5, and 6.4 hours, respectively, in normal subjects. After repeated oral dosages of 100 mg twice daily, a significant reduction in exercise systolic blood pressure was 
evident at 12 hours. When the drug was infused over a 10-minute period, in normal volunteers, maximum beta-blockade was achieved at approximately 20 minutes. Equivalent maximal beta-blocking effect is
achieved with oral and intravenous doses in the ratio of approximately 2.5:1. There is a linear relationship between the log of plasma levels and reduction of exercise heart rate. However, 
antihypertensive activity does not appear to be related to plasma levels.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE Acute Toxicity Several cases of overdosage have been reported, some leading to death. Oral LD 50 â€™s (mg/kg): mice, 1158 to 2460; rats, 3090 to 
4670. Signs and Symptoms Potential signs and symptoms associated with overdosage with metoprolol are bradycardia, hypotension, bronchospasm, myocardial infarction, cardiac failure and death. 
Management There is no specific antidote. In general, patients with acute or recent myocardial infarction may be more hemodynamically unstable than other patients and should be treated accordingly 
(see WARNINGS, Myocardial Infarction ). On the basis of the pharmacologic actions of metoprolol, the following general measures should be employed: Elimination of the Drug: Gastric lavage should be 
performed. Other clinical manifestations of overdose should be managed symptomatically based on modern methods of intensive care. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: overdosage: Hypotension: Administer a 
vasopressor, e.g., levarterenol or dopamine. Bronchospasm: Administer a beta 2 -stimulating agent and/or a theophylline derivative. Cardiac Failure: Administer digitalis glycoside and diuretic. In 
shock resulting from inadequate cardiac contractility, consider administration of dobutamine, isoproterenol or glucagon.

Embryotoxicity and/or fetotoxicity in rats and rabbits were noted starting at doses of 50 mg/kg in rats and 25 mg/kg in rabbits, as demonstrated by increases in preimplantation loss, decreases in the 
number of viable fetuses per dose, and/or decreases in neonatal survival. High doses were associated with some maternal toxicity, and growth delay of the offspring in utero , which was reflected in

has been associated with reversible adverse effects on spermatogenesis starting at oral dose levels of 3.5 mg/kg in rats (a dose that is only 0.1-times the human dose, when based on surface area), 
although other studies have shown no effect of metoprolol tartrate on reproductive performance in male rats. Pregnancy Category C Upon confirming the diagnosis of pregnancy, women should immediately 
inform the doctor. Metoprolol has been shown to increase postimplantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at doses up to 11 times the maximum daily human dose of 450 mg, when based on 
surface area. Distribution studies in mice confirm exposure of the fetus when metoprolol is administered to the pregnant animal. These limited animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful
effects with respect to teratogenicity (see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant 
women. The amount of data on the use of metoprolol in pregnant women is limited. The risk to the fetus/mother is unknown. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human 
response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers Metoprolol is excreted in breast milk in a very small quantity. An infant consuming 1 liter of breast milk 
daily would receive a dose of less than 1 mg of the drug. Fertility The effects of metoprolol on the fertility of human have not been studied. Metoprolol showed effects on spermatogenesis in male rats
at a therapeutic dose level, but had no effect on rates of conception at higher doses in animal fertility studies (see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ). Pediatric Use Safety and 
effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical trials of metoprolol in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of 
elderly patients to determine whether patients over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to metoprolol. Other reported clinical experience in elderly hypertensive patients 
has not identified any difference in response from younger patients. In worldwide clinical trials of metoprolol in myocardial infarction, where approximately 478 patients were over 65 years of age (0 
over 75 years of age), no age-related differences in safety and effectiveness were found. Other reported clinical experience in myocardial infarction has not identified differences in response between
the elderly and younger patients. However, greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals taking metoprolol cannot be categorically ruled out. Therefore, in general, it is recommended that dosing 
proceed with caution in this population.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting Drugs: Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with 
beta-blocking agents or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Observe patients treated with metoprolol plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce 
vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. In addition, possibly significant hypertension may theoretically occur up to 14 days following discontinuation of the concomitant administration with an 
irreversible MAO inhibitor. Digitalis Glycosides and Beta-blockers: Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase 
the risk of bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and PR interval. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Calcium Channel Blockers: Concomitant administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium
channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Potent inhibitors of the CYP2D6 enzyme may 
increase the plasma concentration of metoprolol which would mimic the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (see Pharmacokinetics section). Increase in plasma concentrations of metoprolol would 
decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Known clinically significant potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 are antidepressants such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, 
paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, clomipramine, and desipramine; antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and thioridazine; antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propafenone; 
antiretrovirals such as ritonavir; antihistamines such as diphenhydramine; antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or quinidine; antifungals such as terbinafine. Hydralazine: Concomitant 
administration of hydralazine may inhibit presystemic metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Alpha-adrenergic Agents: 
Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine may be potentiated by beta-blockers including metoprolol. 
Beta-adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing reflex tachycardia. On the contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may 
also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic blocker. If a patient is treated with clonidine and metoprolol 
concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, stop metoprolol several days before clonidine is withdrawn. Rebound hypertension that can follow withdrawal of clonidine may be increased 
in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment.

        Question: Does METOPROLOL TARTRATE increase or decrease the risk of myocardial infarction?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether METOPROLOL TARTRATE increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.
2. FDAHandler responded that METOPROLOL TARTRATE has been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. In a large, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, metoprolol reduced 3-month 
mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction when treated as soon as possible after their arrival in the hospital.
3. The beneficial effects of METOPROLOL TARTRATE were observed with both intravenous and oral administration in the study mentioned in the METOPROLOL TARTRATE label.
        -----
        Final answer: METOPROLOL TARTRATE decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.

METOPROLOL TARTRATE decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. This conclusion is based on a large, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study mentioned in the METOPROLOL TARTRATE label, which 
showed that metoprolol reduced 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction when treated as soon as possible after their arrival in the hospital. The 
beneficial effects were observed with both intravenous and oral administration of metoprolol.
