difference between Am B isome and amphotericin B rates. A negative value is in favor of amphotericin B. A positive value is in favor of Am B isome. The incidence of infusion-related, cardiovascular 
and renal adverse events was lower in patients receiving Am B isome compared to amphotericin B deoxycholate (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section for details); therefore, the risks and benefits (advantages 
and disadvantages) of the different amphotericin B formulations should be taken into consideration when selecting a patient treatment regimen. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Treatment of Patients with 
Aspergillus Species, Candida Species and/or Cryptococcus Species Infections Refractory to Amphotericin B Deoxycholate, or in Patients Where Renal Impairment or Unacceptable Toxicity Precludes the Use 
of Amphotericin B Deoxycholate Am B isome was evaluated in a compassionate use study in hospitalized patients with systemic fungal infections. These patients either had fungal infections refractory to
amphotericin B deoxycholate, were intolerant to the use of amphotericin B deoxycholate, or had pre-existing renal insufficiency. Patient recruitment involved 140 infectious episodes in 133 patients, 
with 53 episodes evaluable for mycological response and 91 episodes evaluable for clinical outcome. Clinical success and mycological eradication occurred in some patients with documented 
aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis Am B isome was studied in patients with visceral leishmaniasis who were infected in the 
Mediterranean basin with documented or presumed Leishmania infantum . Clinical studies have not provided conclusive data regarding efficacy against L. donovani or L. chagasi . Am B isome achieved high
rates of acute parasite clearance in immunocompetent patients when total doses of 12-30 mg/kg were administered. Most of these immunocompetent patients remained relapse-free during follow-up periods 
of 6 months or longer. While acute parasite clearance was achieved in most of the immunocompromised patients who received total doses of 30-40 mg/kg, the majority of these patients were observed to 
relapse in the 6 months following the completion of therapy. Of the 21 immunocompromised patients studied, 17 were coinfected with HIV; approximately half of the HIV-infected patients had AIDS.

amphotericin B deoxycholate, were intolerant to the use of amphotericin B deoxycholate, or had pre-existing renal insufficiency. Patient recruitment involved 140 infectious episodes in 133 patients, 
with 53 episodes evaluable for mycological response and 91 episodes evaluable for clinical outcome. Clinical success and mycological eradication occurred in some patients with documented 
aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis Am B isome was studied in patients with visceral leishmaniasis who were infected in the 
Mediterranean basin with documented or presumed Leishmania infantum . Clinical studies have not provided conclusive data regarding efficacy against L. donovani or L. chagasi . Am B isome achieved high
rates of acute parasite clearance in immunocompetent patients when total doses of 12-30 mg/kg were administered. Most of these immunocompetent patients remained relapse-free during follow-up periods 
of 6 months or longer. While acute parasite clearance was achieved in most of the immunocompromised patients who received total doses of 30-40 mg/kg, the majority of these patients were observed to 
relapse in the 6 months following the completion of therapy. Of the 21 immunocompromised patients studied, 17 were coinfected with HIV; approximately half of the HIV-infected patients had AIDS.

Mediterranean basin with documented or presumed Leishmania infantum . Clinical studies have not provided conclusive data regarding efficacy against L. donovani or L. chagasi . Am B isome achieved high
rates of acute parasite clearance in immunocompetent patients when total doses of 12-30 mg/kg were administered. Most of these immunocompetent patients remained relapse-free during follow-up periods 
of 6 months or longer. While acute parasite clearance was achieved in most of the immunocompromised patients who received total doses of 30-40 mg/kg, the majority of these patients were observed to 
relapse in the 6 months following the completion of therapy. Of the 21 immunocompromised patients studied, 17 were coinfected with HIV; approximately half of the HIV-infected patients had AIDS.

CONTENT: AMBISOME: clinical_studies: The following table presents a comparison of efficacy rates among immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients infected in the Mediterranean basin who had no 
prior treatment or remote prior treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. Efficacy is expressed as both acute parasite clearance at the end of therapy (EOT) and as overall success (clearance with no 
relapse) during the follow-up period (F/U) of greater than 6 months for immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients: AmBisome Efficacy in Visceral Leishmaniasis Immunocompetent Patients No. of

in the majority of patients. While case reports have suggested there may be a role for long-term therapy to prevent relapses in HIV coinfected patients (Lopez-Dupla, et al. AMBISOME: clinical_studies:
J Antimicrob Chemother 1993; 32: 657-659), there are no data to date documenting the efficacy or safety of repeat courses of Am B isome or of maintenance therapy with this drug among immunocompromised

usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I attempted to use the recipient_message tool to ask FDAHandler whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction.
2. However, there seems to be a technical issue preventing me from receiving a response from FDAHandler.

usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse

and renal adverse events was lower in patients receiving Am B isome compared to amphotericin B deoxycholate (see ADVERSE REACTIONS section for details); therefore, the risks and benefits (advantages 
and disadvantages) of the different amphotericin B formulations should be taken into consideration when selecting a patient treatment regimen. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Treatment of Patients with 
Aspergillus Species, Candida Species and/or Cryptococcus Species Infections Refractory to Amphotericin B Deoxycholate, or in Patients Where Renal Impairment or Unacceptable Toxicity Precludes the Use 
of Amphotericin B Deoxycholate Am B isome was evaluated in a compassionate use study in hospitalized patients with systemic fungal infections. These patients either had fungal infections refractory to
amphotericin B deoxycholate, were intolerant to the use of amphotericin B deoxycholate, or had pre-existing renal insufficiency. Patient recruitment involved 140 infectious episodes in 133 patients, 
with 53 episodes evaluable for mycological response and 91 episodes evaluable for clinical outcome. Clinical success and mycological eradication occurred in some patients with documented 
aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Treatment of Visceral Leishmaniasis Am B isome was studied in patients with visceral leishmaniasis who were infected in the 
Mediterranean basin with documented or presumed Leishmania infantum . Clinical studies have not provided conclusive data regarding efficacy against L. donovani or L. chagasi . Am B isome achieved high
rates of acute parasite clearance in immunocompetent patients when total doses of 12-30 mg/kg were administered. Most of these immunocompetent patients remained relapse-free during follow-up periods 
of 6 months or longer. While acute parasite clearance was achieved in most of the immunocompromised patients who received total doses of 30-40 mg/kg, the majority of these patients were observed to 
relapse in the 6 months following the completion of therapy. Of the 21 immunocompromised patients studied, 17 were coinfected with HIV; approximately half of the HIV-infected patients had AIDS.

The question was whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. I attempted to use the recipient_message tool to ask FDAHandler for information regarding the effects of 
AMBISOME on the risk of myocardial infarction. However, due to a technical issue, I did not receive any response from FDAHandler. Without specific data from the FDA, I cannot provide a reliable answer
based on FDA label data. Therefore, I do not have the necessary information to determine the effect of AMBISOME on the risk of myocardial infarction, leading to a DO-NOT-KNOW answer.
