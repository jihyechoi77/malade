                Passages:
                1. Drug PHENYTOIN SODIUM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for PHENYTOIN SODIUM does not explicitly state that it increases or decreases the risk of angioedema. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, we do not know if PHENYTOIN SODIUM has an 
effect on the risk of angioedema.
2. Drug PHENYTOIN: The question was whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases the risk of angioedema. According to the FDA label information provided by FDAHandler, PHENYTOIN does not specifically list
angioedema as a risk. However, the label does mention the risk of serious dermatologic reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), as well as Drug 
Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). These conditions can be severe and potentially life-threatening, involving fever, rash, and other organ system involvement, and require 
immediate evaluation and potential discontinuation of phenytoin if no other etiology can be established. Therefore, while angioedema is not explicitly listed, there is a possibility of severe skin and
hypersensitivity reactions that could be related to angioedema-like symptoms.
3. Drug EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of angioedema. Patients are advised to discontinue the medication and seek immediate medical care if they develop 
signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling. This information is based on the EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label provided by FDAHandler.

                Does the phenytoin category of drugs increase the risk of
                angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the phenytoin category of drugs increase the risk of angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 states that the FDA label for PHENYTOIN SODIUM does not explicitly state whether it increases or decreases the risk of angioedema, indicating a lack of clear evidence.
2. Passage 2 indicates that while PHENYTOIN does not specifically list angioedema as a risk, it does mention the risk of serious dermatologic reactions, which could be related to angioedema-like 
symptoms. This suggests a potential, albeit indirect, risk increase.
3. Passage 3 explicitly states that EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of angioedema, advising patients to discontinue the medication and seek immediate medical care if they develop 
symptoms.
4. Considering the information from all passages, it appears that there is evidence of an increased risk of angioedema with at least one drug in the phenytoin category (EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM), 
while the risk associated with other drugs in the category is not clearly stated or is indirect.
        -----
        Final answer: The phenytoin category of drugs appears to increase the risk of angioedema, at least with one specific drug (EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM), while the effect of other drugs in the 
category is less clear.
