CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension and Angina Most adverse effects have been mild and transient. Central Nervous System: Tiredness and dizziness have 
occurred in about 10 of 100 patients. Depression has been reported in about 5 of 100 patients. Mental confusion and short-term memory loss have been reported. Headache, nightmares, and insomnia have 
also been reported. Cardiovascular: Shortness of breath and bradycardia have occurred in approximately 3 of 100 patients. Cold extremities; arterial insufficiency, usually of the Raynaud type; 
palpitations; congestive heart failure; peripheral edema; and hypotension have been reported in about 1 of 100 patients. Gangrene in patients with pre-existing severe peripheral circulatory disorders 
has also been reported very rarely. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS . METOPROLOL TARTRATE: adverse_reactions: ) Respiratory: Wheezing (bronchospasm) and dyspnea have been reported 
in about 1 of 100 patients (see WARNINGS ). Rhinitis has also been reported. Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea has occurred in about 5 of 100 patients. Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, 
flatulence, and heartburn have been reported in about 1 of 100 patients. Vomiting was a common occurrence. Postmarketing experience reveals very rare reports of hepatitis, jaundice and non-specific 
hepatic dysfunction. Isolated cases of transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactic dehydrogenase elevations have also been reported. Hypersensitive Reactions: Pruritus or rash have occurred in 
about 5 of 100 patients. Very rarely, photosensitivity and worsening of psoriasis has been reported. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: adverse_reactions: Miscellaneous: Peyronie’s disease has been reported in 
fewer than 1 of 100,000 patients. Musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, and tinnitus have also been reported. There have been rare reports of reversible alopecia, agranulocytosis, and dry eyes. 
Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. There have been very rare reports of weight gain, arthritis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis 
(relationship to metoprolol has not been definitely established). The oculomucocutaneous syndrome associated with the beta-blocker practolol has not been reported with metoprolol. Myocardial 
Infarction Central Nervous System: Tiredness has been reported in about 1 of 100 patients. Vertigo, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, headache, dizziness, visual disturbances, confusion, and reduced
libido have also been reported, but a drug relationship is not clear.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Alpha-adrenergic Agents: Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or 
clonidine may be potentiated by beta-blockers including metoprolol. Beta-adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing 
reflex tachycardia. On the contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic 
blocker. If a patient is treated with clonidine and metoprolol concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, stop metoprolol several days before clonidine is withdrawn. Rebound 
hypertension that can follow withdrawal of clonidine may be increased in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: Ergot Alkaloid: Concomitant 
administration with beta-blockers may enhance the vasoconstrictive action of ergot alkaloids. Dipyridamole: In general, administration of a beta-blocker should be withheld before dipyridamole testing,
with careful monitoring of heart rate following the dipyridamole injection. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have been conducted to evaluate 
carcinogenic potential. In a 2-year study in rats at three oral dosage levels of up to 800 mg/kg per day, there was no increase in the development of spontaneously occurring benign or malignant 
neoplasms of any type. The only histologic changes that appeared to be drug related were an increased incidence of generally mild focal accumulation of foamy macrophages in pulmonary alveoli and a 
slight increase in biliary hyperplasia. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: In a 21-month study in Swiss albino mice at three oral dosage levels of up to 750 mg/kg per day, benign lung tumors (small 
adenomas) occurred more frequently in female mice receiving the highest dose than in untreated control animals. There was no increase in malignant or total (benign plus malignant) lung tumors, or in 
the overall incidence of tumors or malignant tumors. This 21-month study was repeated in CD-1 mice, and no statistically or biologically significant differences were observed between treated and 
control mice of either sex for any type of tumor. All mutagenicity tests performed (a dominant lethal study in mice, chromosome studies in somatic cells, a Salmonella/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity 
test, and a nucleus anomaly test in somatic interphase nuclei) were negative. Reproduction toxicity studies in mice, rats and rabbits did not indicate teratogenic potential for metoprolol tartrate. 
METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: Embryotoxicity and/or fetotoxicity in rats and rabbits were noted starting at doses of 50 mg/kg in rats and 25 mg/kg in rabbits, as demonstrated by increases in 
preimplantation loss, decreases in the number of viable fetuses per dose, and/or decreases in neonatal survival. High doses were associated with some maternal toxicity, and growth delay of the 
offspring in utero , which was reflected in minimally lower weights at birth. The oral NOAELs for embryo-fetal development in mice, rats, and rabbits were considered to be 25, 200, and 12.5 mg/kg. 
This corresponds to dose levels that are approximately 0.3, 4, and 0.5 times, respectively, when based on surface area, the maximum human oral dose (8 mg/kg/day) of metoprolol tartrate. METOPROLOL 
TARTRATE: precautions: Metoprolol tartrate has been associated with reversible adverse effects on spermatogenesis starting at oral dose levels of 3.5 mg/kg in rats (a dose that is only 0.1-times the 
human dose, when based on surface area), although other studies have shown no effect of metoprolol tartrate on reproductive performance in male rats. Pregnancy Category C Upon confirming the diagnosis
of pregnancy, women should immediately inform the doctor. Metoprolol has been shown to increase postimplantation loss and decrease neonatal survival in rats at doses up to 11 times the maximum daily 
human dose of 450 mg, when based on surface area. Distribution studies in mice confirm exposure of the fetus when metoprolol is administered to the pregnant animal. These limited animal studies do not
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to teratogenicity (see Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ).

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Individualized the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken 
with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. Increase the dosage 
at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective 
dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: While once-daily dosing is 
effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period, and larger or more 
frequent daily doses may be required. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the
day. Beta 1 selectivity diminishes as the dose of metoprolol is increased. Angina Pectoris The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be 
taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until 
optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is pronounced slowing of the heart rate. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets 
is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, gradually decrease the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks (see WARNINGS ). 
Myocardial Infarction Early Treatment During the early phase of definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, initiate treatment with metoprolol tartrate tablets as soon as possible after the 
patient's arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient’s hemodynamic condition has stabilized. Begin treatment in this 
early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; give the injections at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous 
administration of metoprolol, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: In patients who tolerate the full intravenous dose (15 mg), 
initiate metoprolol tartrate tablets, 50 mg every 6 hours, 15 minutes after the last intravenous dose and continue for 48 hours. Thereafter, the maintenance dosage is 100 mg twice daily (see Late 
Treatment below). Start patients who appear not to tolerate the full intravenous dose on metoprolol tartrate tablets either 25 mg or 50 mg every 6 hours (depending on the degree of intolerance) 15 
minutes after the last intravenous dose or as soon as their clinical condition allows. In patients with severe intolerance, discontinue metoprolol tartrate tablets (see WARNINGS ). METOPROLOL 
TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: Late Treatment Start patients with contraindications to treatment during the early phase of suspected or definite myocardial infarction, patients who appear not to
tolerate the full early treatment, and patients in whom the physician wishes to delay therapy for any other reason on metoprolol tartrate tablets, 100 mg twice daily, as soon as their clinical 
condition allows. Continue therapy for at least 3 months. Although the efficacy of metoprolol beyond 3 months has not been conclusively established, data from studies with other beta-blockers suggest 
that treatment should be continued for 1 to 3 years. Special Populations Pediatric Patients : No pediatric studies have been performed. The safety and efficacy of metoprolol tartrate tablets in 
pediatric patients have not been established. Renal Impairment : No dose adjustment of metoprolol tartrate tablets is required in patients with renal impairment. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: 
dosage_and_administration: Hepatic Impairment : Metoprolol blood levels are likely to increase substantially in patients with hepatic impairment. Therefore, metoprolol tartrate tablets should be 
initiated at low doses with cautious gradual dose titration according to clinical response. Geriatric Patients (>65 years) : In general, use a low initial starting dose in elderly patients given their
greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Method of Administration For oral treatment, the tablets should be swallowed 
un-chewed with a glass of water. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should always be taken in standardized relation with meals. If the physician asks the patient to take metoprolol tartrate tablets either 
before breakfast or with breakfast, then the patient should continue taking metoprolol with the same schedule during the course of therapy.

Miscellaneous: Unstable diabetes and claudication have been reported, but a drug relationship is not clear. Potential Adverse Reactions A variety of adverse reactions not listed above have been 
reported with other beta-adrenergic blocking agents and should be considered potential adverse reactions to metoprolol. Central Nervous System: Reversible mental depression progressing to catatonia; 
an acute reversible syndrome characterized by disorientation for time and place, short-term memory loss, emotional lability, slightly clouded sensorium, and decreased performance on 
neuropsychometrics. Cardiovascular: Intensification of AV block (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura and thrombocytopenic purpura. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: 
adverse_reactions: Hypersensitive Reactions: Fever combined with aching and sore throat, laryngospasm and respiratory distress. Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been 
reported during postapproval use of metoprolol: confusional state, an increase in blood triglycerides and a decrease in High Density Lipoprotein (HDL). Because these reports are from a population of 
uncertain size and are subject to confounding factors, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Risk of Anaphylactic Reactions While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may 
be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction. Information 
for Patients Advise patients to take metoprolol regularly and continuously, as directed, with or immediately following meals. If a dose should be missed, the patient should take only the next 
scheduled dose (without doubling it). Patients should not discontinue metoprolol without consulting the physician. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: Advise patients (1) to avoid operating automobiles 
and machinery or engaging in other tasks requiring alertness until the patient’s response to therapy with metoprolol has been determined; (2) to contact the physician if any difficulty in breathing 
occurs; (3) to inform the physician or dentist before any type of surgery that he or she is taking metoprolol. Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting Drugs: Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., 
reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. Observe patients treated with metoprolol plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence 
of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: precautions: In addition, possibly significant hypertension may theoretically 
occur up to 14 days following discontinuation of the concomitant administration with an irreversible MAO inhibitor. Digitalis Glycosides and Beta-blockers: Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers 
slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Monitor heart rate and PR interval. Calcium Channel Blockers: Concomitant administration
of a beta-adrenergic antagonist with a calcium channel blocker may produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility because of negative chronotropic and inotropic effects. CYP2D6 Inhibitors: 
Potent inhibitors of the CYP2D6 enzyme may increase the plasma concentration of metoprolol which would mimic the pharmacokinetics of CYP2D6 poor metabolizer (see Pharmacokinetics section). Increase in
plasma concentrations of metoprolol would decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol.
