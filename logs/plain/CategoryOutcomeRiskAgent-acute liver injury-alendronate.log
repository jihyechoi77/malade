                1. Drug ALENDRONATE SODIUM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ALENDRONATE SODIUM does not specify whether it increases the risk of acute liver injury. Therefore, based on the available FDA data, we cannot determine if there is an increased or 
decreased risk of acute liver injury associated with the use of ALENDRONATE SODIUM.
2. Drug ALENDRONATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether ALENDRONATE increases or decreases the risk of acute liver injury. I asked FDAHandler for information regarding the risk of acute liver injury associated with ALENDRONATE. 
FDAHandler did not provide any information on this matter. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not known whether ALENDRONATE has an effect on the risk of acute liver injury.
                ---------
                Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of
                acute liver injury, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of acute liver injury, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for ALENDRONATE SODIUM does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of acute liver injury.
2. No information was provided by FDAHandler regarding the risk of acute liver injury associated with ALENDRONATE.
3. Based on the available FDA data, it is not known whether ALENDRONATE SODIUM or ALENDRONATE has an effect on the risk of acute liver injury.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the alendronate category of drugs on the risk of acute liver injury based on the available FDA data.
