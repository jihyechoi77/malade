CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Several cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in patients receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy. 1,2,3 Leukopenia 
associated with silver sulfadiazine administration is primarily characterized by decreased neutrophil count. Maximal white blood cell depression occurs within two to four days of initiation of 
therapy. Rebound to normal leukocyte levels follows onset within two to three days. Recovery is not influenced by continuation of silver sulfadiazine therapy. An increased incidence has been seen in 
patients treated concurrently with cimetidine. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiforme, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial 
nephritis. Reduction in bacterial growth after application of topical antibacterial agents has been reported to permit spontaneous healing of deep partial-thickness burns by preventing conversion of 
the partial thickness to full thickness by sepsis. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: However, reduction in bacterial colonization has caused delayed separation, in some cases necessitating 
escharotomy in order to prevent contracture.

        Question: Does SILVER SULFADIAZINE increase or decrease the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether SILVER SULFADIAZINE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler could not provide an answer based on FDA label data.
        -----
        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question asked was whether SILVER SULFADIAZINE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. I consulted FDAHandler to seek information from FDA label data regarding 
this matter. However, FDAHandler could not provide an answer based on the available FDA label data. Therefore, I do not have the information required to determine the effect of SILVER SULFADIAZINE on 
the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
