        Question: Which three drugs from the provided list are the most common representatives in the category warfarin?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. From the provided list, the drugs that fall under the category of warfarin are 'WARFARIN SODIUM', 'JANTOVEN', and 'WARFARIN'.
2. The query results show usage rates for 'Warfarin', 'Jantoven', and 'warfarin'.
3. Since 'Warfarin' and 'warfarin' represent the same drug, their usage rates should be combined. The combined usage rate for 'Warfarin' is 142996 (142985 + 11).
4. The usage rate for 'Jantoven' is 7, which is the brand name for warfarin.
5. The drug 'WARFARIN SODIUM' is not explicitly listed in the query results, but it is the same medication as 'Warfarin' and 'warfarin' with a different salt form. Therefore, it is reasonable to 
assume that it shares the same usage rate as 'Warfarin'.
6. Based on the usage rates, the three most common representatives in the category warfarin from the provided list are 'WARFARIN SODIUM', 'JANTOVEN', and 'WARFARIN'.
