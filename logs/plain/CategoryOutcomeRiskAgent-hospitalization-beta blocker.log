                Passages:
                1. Drug METOPROLOL TARTRATE: The final answer to the question "Does METOPROLOL TARTRATE increase or decrease the risk of hospitalization?" is that METOPROLOL TARTRATE has been shown to
reduce 3-month mortality by 36% in patients with suspected or definite myocardial infarction, which suggests a decrease in the risk of hospitalization for these patients. However, the precise impact 
on hospitalization risk, especially separate from early intravenous treatment, is not explicitly detailed.
2. Drug LABETALOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question asked whether labetalol increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. The FDA label data does not specify any information regarding labetalol's effect on the risk of 
hospitalization. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the FDA label whether labetalol has an impact on hospitalization risk. Without specific data, we cannot establish a causal relationship
or assess the degree of risk associated with labetalol in the context of hospitalization.
3. Drug ATENOLOL: Atenolol has been shown to decrease the risk of hospitalization specifically in the context of managing hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial 
infarction by reducing cardiovascular mortality, as evidenced by the ISIS-1 clinical trial. This evidence does not necessarily generalize to all uses of Atenolol or to all patient populations.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passage for METOPROLOL TARTRATE indicates that it reduces 3-month mortality in patients with myocardial infarction, which suggests a decrease in the risk of hospitalization for these 
patients, although the precise impact on hospitalization risk is not explicitly detailed.
2. The passage for LABETALOL does not provide any information regarding its effect on the risk of hospitalization, as the FDA label data does not specify this effect.
3. The passage for ATENOLOL indicates that it decreases the risk of hospitalization in the context of managing hemodynamically stable patients with acute myocardial infarction by reducing 
cardiovascular mortality, according to the ISIS-1 clinical trial.
4. Based on the information provided, two out of the three beta blockers (METOPROLOL TARTRATE and ATENOLOL) have evidence suggesting a decrease in the risk of hospitalization in specific contexts, 
while there is no information available for LABETALOL.
5. The evidence for a decrease in hospitalization risk is based on clinical trials and mortality reduction, which is a strong indicator of the drugs' effectiveness in certain patient populations.
6. Since the information for LABETALOL is missing, it cannot be concluded that all beta blockers have the same effect on hospitalization risk.
7. However, the evidence from METOPROLOL TARTRATE and ATENOLOL suggests that, at least for some beta blockers, there is a tendency to decrease the risk of hospitalization in certain contexts.

        Final answer: Based on the available evidence, the beta blocker category of drugs tends to decrease the risk of hospitalization in certain contexts, but the effect is not uniformly established
across all beta blockers due to the lack of information for LABETALOL.
