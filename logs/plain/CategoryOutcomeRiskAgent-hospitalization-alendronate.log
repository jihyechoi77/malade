                1. Drug ALENDRONATE SODIUM: The risk of hospitalization is not directly addressed in the context of ALENDRONATE SODIUM use, but severe esophageal adverse experiences associated with 
its use can occasionally lead to hospitalization.
2. Drug ALENDRONATE: Alendronate can increase the risk of hospitalization due to severe esophageal adverse reactions, particularly when not used according to the proper guidelines. It is important to 
follow dosing instructions to minimize this risk.
                ---------
                Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of
                hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that while the risk of hospitalization is not directly addressed, severe esophageal adverse experiences associated with ALENDRONATE SODIUM use can occasionally lead to 
hospitalization.
2. Passage 2 states that Alendronate can increase the risk of hospitalization due to severe esophageal adverse reactions, especially when not used according to proper guidelines.
3. Both passages suggest that there is a potential for increased risk of hospitalization due to severe esophageal adverse reactions when using drugs in the alendronate category.
        -----
        Final answer: The alendronate category of drugs can increase the risk of hospitalization.
