        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. First, I combined the usage rates of drugs with different names but the same active ingredient, considering different formulations and brand names.
2. The combined usage rates for the drugs with the same active ingredient are as follows: Lorazepam (202,152), Diazepam (39,173), Midazolam (23,410), Clonazepam (29,658), Alprazolam (11,902), Oxazepam

(2).
3. Based on the combined usage rates, the three most common benzodiazepines from the list are Lorazepam, Diazepam, and Clonazepam.
4. I selected the names exactly as they appear on the original list: LORAZEPAM, DIAZEPAM, and CLONAZEPAM.
        -----
        Final answer: The three most common benzodiazepines from the provided list are LORAZEPAM, DIAZEPAM, and CLONAZEPAM.
