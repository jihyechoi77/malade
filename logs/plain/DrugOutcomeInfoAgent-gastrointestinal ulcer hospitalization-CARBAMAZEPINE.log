CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole), cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, dalfopristin, danazol, dantrolene, delavirdine, diltiazem,
erythromycin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, ibuprofen, isoniazid, loratadine, macrolides, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, olanzapine, omeprazole, oxybutynin, protease inhibitors, 
propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, ticlopidine, troleandomycin, valproate, verapamil, zileuton. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Human microsomal epoxide hydrolase has been identified as the enzyme
responsible for the formation of the 10,11-transdiol derivative from carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide. Coadministration of inhibitors of human microsomal epoxide hydrolase may result in increased 
carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide plasma concentrations. Accordingly, the dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be adjusted and/or the plasma levels monitored when used concomitantly with
loxapine, quetiapine, or valproic acid. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these 
CYP3A4 or epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, it is reasonable to expect that a dose reduction for carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Agents that 
Induce Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes : Carbamazepine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the potential exists for interaction between carbamazepine and any agent that induces CYP3A4. Agents that are CYP
inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of carbamazepine extended-release capsules include, for example, the following: Aminophylline, cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, 
felbamate, fosphenytoin, methsuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin( 1 ), primidone, rifampin and theophylline. (1) Phenytoin plasma levels have also been reported to increase and decrease in the presence
of carbamazepine, see below. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on carbamazepine extended-release capsules, and then begins a course of treatment
with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be necessary. Agents with Decreased Levels in the Presence of 
Carbamazepine due to Induction of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: Carbamazepine is a potent inducer of hepatic CYP3A4 and is also known to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and may therefore reduce plasma
concentrations of co-medications mainly metabolized by CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and 3A4, through induction of their metabolism. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: When used concomitantly with carbamazepine
extended-release capsules, monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment of these agents may be necessary: When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be doubled. 
Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. If carbamazepine is later withdrawn, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When carbamazepine is used with tacrolimus, monitoring 
of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are recommended. The use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine should be avoided with temsirolimus. If 
patients must be coadministered carbamazepine with temsirolimus, an adjustment of temsirolimus dosage should be considered. The use of carbamazepine with lapatinib should generally be avoided. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: If carbamazepine is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up. If carbamazepine is discontinued, the 
lapatinib dose should be reduced. Concomitant use of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic 
effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monitor concentrations of valproate when carbamazepine extended-release capsules are introduced 
or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In addition, carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of, for example, the following drugs,
for which monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment may be necessary: Acetaminophen, albendazole, alprazolam, aprepitant, buprenorphine, apixaban( 6 ), bupropion, buspirone, citalopram, 
clobazam, clonazepam, clozapine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone), cyclosporin, dabigatran( 6 ), delavirdine, desipramine, diazepam, dicumarol, dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: felodipine), doxycycline, edoxaban( 6 ), eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, everolimus, felbamate, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, 
levothyroxine, lorazepam, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives( 2 ), oxcarbazepine, paliperidone, phenytoin( 3
), praziquantel, protease inhibitors, quetiapine, risperidone, rivaroxaban( 6 ), sertraline, sirolimus, tadalafil, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, triazolam, trazodone CARBAMAZEPINE: 
drug_interactions: ( 4 ), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin (5) , ziprasidone, and zonisamide. ( 2 ) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with
hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be 
decreased. Breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancies have been reported with carbamazepine. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered. ( 3 ) Phenytoin has also been 
reported to increase in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ( 4 ) 
Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine )
by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values. (5) Warfarin’s anticoagulant effect can be reduced in the presence of carbamazepine. (6) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban (direct acting oral anticoagulants) is expected to result in decreased plasma concentrations of these anticoagulants that may be insufficient to achieve
the intended therapeutic effect. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In general, coadministration of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban should be avoided. Thus, if a 
patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that 
a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary. Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine Carbamazepine extended-release capsules increase the plasma levels of the 
following agents. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules,
it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin( 7 ), and Primidone Carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules can increase the concentrations of clomipramine, phenytoin, and primidone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of these agents in this category, and then
begins treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these drugs. ( 7 )Phenytoin has also been reported to decrease in the presence of 
carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide is an inactive prodrug and is converted to its 
active metabolite in part by CYP3A. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide are reportedly increased by chronic co-administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers. There is a potential for increased cyclophosphamide toxicity when coadministered with carbamazepine. Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Carbamazepine: Delavirdine 
Coadministration of carbamazepine with delavirdine may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Lithium Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects. Thyroid Effects with Other Anticonvulsant Medications Alterations
of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Chloroquine and Mefloquine Anti-malarial drugs, such as 
chloroquine and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of carbamazepine. Thus if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of 
treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose adjustment may be necessary. CNS Depressants The concomitant use of carbamazepine extended-release 
capsules and other CNS depressants can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, hypotension, and syncope.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: general_precautions: General Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made. Carbamazepine should be used with caution in patients with a
mixed seizure disorder that includes atypical absence seizures, since in these patients carbamazepine has been associated with increased frequency of generalized convulsions (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE
). Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance, including second- and third-degree atrioventricular (AV) 
block; cardiac, hepatic, or renal damage; adverse hematologic or hypersensitivity reaction to other drugs including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with 
carbamazepine. AV block, including second- and third-degree block, has been reported following carbamazepine treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG 
abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances. CARBAMAZEPINE: general_precautions: Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of hepatic failure, have 
been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS , Laboratory Tests ). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition, rare instances of vanishing 
bile duct syndrome have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance 
of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as multiorgan hypersensitivity/ DRESS and serious 
dermatologic reactions. As an example, there has been a report of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and in another case an association with fever and eosinophilia.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication 
Guide before taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of 
liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Patients should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, they must report any occurrence immediately to
their physicians. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use. CARBAMAZEPINE: 
information_for_patients: Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In the event a skin reaction should 
occur while taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS ). Patients should be advised that anaphylactic reactions and 
angioedema may occur during treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients to immediately report signs and symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the 
face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their healthcare provider. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: 
Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including carbamazepine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert 
for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern 
should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use 
of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products. Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive 
sedative effect. Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of 
antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 (see Warnings-Usage in Pregnancy ). If necessary, the carbamazepine extended-release capsules can
be opened and the contents sprinkled over food, such as a teaspoon of applesauce or other similar food products. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules or their contents should not be crushed or 
chewed. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use of any other prescription or non-prescription 
medication or herbal products. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide, and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide prior 
to taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: See FDA approved Medication Guide.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients 
was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four 
suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal 
thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the 
analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs
in the data analyzed. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used
for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 
- Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of 
Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.
CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: 9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other 
conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing carbamazepine extended-release capsules or any other AED must 
balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and 
mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these 
symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Hyponatremia, Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion, and Water Intoxication 
Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic 
hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with carbamazepine treatment may be dose-related. Elderly patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing 
hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can 
lead to falls. Consider discontinuing carbamazepine extended-release capsules in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia. Usage in Pregnancy Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including spina 
bifida. There have also been reports that associate carbamazepine with developmental disorders and congenital anomalies (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, and anomalies 
involving various body systems). Developmental delays have been reported. When treating or counseling women of childbearing potential, the prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of 
therapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. 
Retrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. 
Therefore, if therapy is to be continued, monotherapy may be preferable for pregnant women.

CYP3A4 or epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, it is reasonable to expect that a dose reduction for carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Agents that 
Induce Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes : Carbamazepine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the potential exists for interaction between carbamazepine and any agent that induces CYP3A4. Agents that are CYP
inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of carbamazepine extended-release capsules include, for example, the following: Aminophylline, cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, 
felbamate, fosphenytoin, methsuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin( 1 ), primidone, rifampin and theophylline. (1) Phenytoin plasma levels have also been reported to increase and decrease in the presence
of carbamazepine, see below. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on carbamazepine extended-release capsules, and then begins a course of treatment
with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be necessary. Agents with Decreased Levels in the Presence of 
Carbamazepine due to Induction of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: Carbamazepine is a potent inducer of hepatic CYP3A4 and is also known to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and may therefore reduce plasma
concentrations of co-medications mainly metabolized by CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and 3A4, through induction of their metabolism. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: When used concomitantly with carbamazepine
extended-release capsules, monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment of these agents may be necessary: When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be doubled. 
Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. If carbamazepine is later withdrawn, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When carbamazepine is used with tacrolimus, monitoring 
of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are recommended. The use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine should be avoided with temsirolimus. If 
patients must be coadministered carbamazepine with temsirolimus, an adjustment of temsirolimus dosage should be considered. The use of carbamazepine with lapatinib should generally be avoided. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: If carbamazepine is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up. If carbamazepine is discontinued, the 
lapatinib dose should be reduced. Concomitant use of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic 
effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monitor concentrations of valproate when carbamazepine extended-release capsules are introduced 
or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In addition, carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of, for example, the following drugs,
for which monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment may be necessary: Acetaminophen, albendazole, alprazolam, aprepitant, buprenorphine, apixaban( 6 ), bupropion, buspirone, citalopram, 
clobazam, clonazepam, clozapine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone), cyclosporin, dabigatran( 6 ), delavirdine, desipramine, diazepam, dicumarol, dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: felodipine), doxycycline, edoxaban( 6 ), eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, everolimus, felbamate, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, 
levothyroxine, lorazepam, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives( 2 ), oxcarbazepine, paliperidone, phenytoin( 3
), praziquantel, protease inhibitors, quetiapine, risperidone, rivaroxaban( 6 ), sertraline, sirolimus, tadalafil, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, triazolam, trazodone CARBAMAZEPINE: 
drug_interactions: ( 4 ), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin (5) , ziprasidone, and zonisamide. ( 2 ) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with
hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be 
decreased. Breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancies have been reported with carbamazepine. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered. ( 3 ) Phenytoin has also been 
reported to increase in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ( 4 ) 
Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine )
by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values. (5) Warfarin’s anticoagulant effect can be reduced in the presence of carbamazepine. (6) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban (direct acting oral anticoagulants) is expected to result in decreased plasma concentrations of these anticoagulants that may be insufficient to achieve
the intended therapeutic effect. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In general, coadministration of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban should be avoided. Thus, if a 
patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that 
a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary. Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine Carbamazepine extended-release capsules increase the plasma levels of the 
following agents. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules,
it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin( 7 ), and Primidone Carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules can increase the concentrations of clomipramine, phenytoin, and primidone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of these agents in this category, and then
begins treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these drugs. ( 7 )Phenytoin has also been reported to decrease in the presence of 
carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide is an inactive prodrug and is converted to its 
active metabolite in part by CYP3A. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide are reportedly increased by chronic co-administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers. There is a potential for increased cyclophosphamide toxicity when coadministered with carbamazepine. Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Carbamazepine: Delavirdine 
Coadministration of carbamazepine with delavirdine may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Lithium Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects. Thyroid Effects with Other Anticonvulsant Medications Alterations
of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Chloroquine and Mefloquine Anti-malarial drugs, such as 
chloroquine and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of carbamazepine. Thus if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of 
treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose adjustment may be necessary. CNS Depressants The concomitant use of carbamazepine extended-release 
capsules and other CNS depressants can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, hypotension, and syncope.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: general_precautions: General Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made. Carbamazepine should be used with caution in patients with a
mixed seizure disorder that includes atypical absence seizures, since in these patients carbamazepine has been associated with increased frequency of generalized convulsions (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE
). Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance, including second- and third-degree atrioventricular (AV) 
block; cardiac, hepatic, or renal damage; adverse hematologic or hypersensitivity reaction to other drugs including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with 
carbamazepine. AV block, including second- and third-degree block, has been reported following carbamazepine treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG 
abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances. CARBAMAZEPINE: general_precautions: Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of hepatic failure, have 
been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS , Laboratory Tests ). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition, rare instances of vanishing 
bile duct syndrome have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance 
of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as multiorgan hypersensitivity/ DRESS and serious 
dermatologic reactions. As an example, there has been a report of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and in another case an association with fever and eosinophilia.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication 
Guide before taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of 
liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Patients should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, they must report any occurrence immediately to
their physicians. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use. CARBAMAZEPINE: 
information_for_patients: Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In the event a skin reaction should 
occur while taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS ). Patients should be advised that anaphylactic reactions and 
angioedema may occur during treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients to immediately report signs and symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the 
face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their healthcare provider. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: 
Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including carbamazepine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert 
for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern 
should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use 
of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products. Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive 
sedative effect. Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of 
antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 (see Warnings-Usage in Pregnancy ). If necessary, the carbamazepine extended-release capsules can
be opened and the contents sprinkled over food, such as a teaspoon of applesauce or other similar food products. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules or their contents should not be crushed or 
chewed. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use of any other prescription or non-prescription 
medication or herbal products. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide, and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide prior 
to taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: See FDA approved Medication Guide.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients 
was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four 
suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal 
thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the 
analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs
in the data analyzed. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used
for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 
- Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of 
Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.
CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: 9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other 
conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing carbamazepine extended-release capsules or any other AED must 
balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and 
mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these 
symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Hyponatremia, Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion, and Water Intoxication 
Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic 
hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with carbamazepine treatment may be dose-related. Elderly patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing 
hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can 
lead to falls. Consider discontinuing carbamazepine extended-release capsules in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia. Usage in Pregnancy Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including spina 
bifida. There have also been reports that associate carbamazepine with developmental disorders and congenital anomalies (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, and anomalies 
involving various body systems). Developmental delays have been reported. When treating or counseling women of childbearing potential, the prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of 
therapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. 
Retrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. 
Therefore, if therapy is to be continued, monotherapy may be preferable for pregnant women.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: WARNINGS Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk 
in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not 
drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 Allele 
Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of
an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in 
allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity. Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, 
Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, 
averaging 2 to 4%, but higher in some groups. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: HLA-B*1502 is present in <1% of the population in Japan and Korea. HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian 
origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans). Prior to initiating carbamazepine extended-release capsules therapy, testing for HLA-B*1502 should be performed in 
patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA-B*1502 may be present. In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, 
keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. 
Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE Acute Toxicity Lowest known lethal dose: adults, >60 g (39-year-old man). Highest known doses survived: adults, 30 g (31-year-old woman); children, 10 g 
(6-year-old boy); small children, 5 g (3-year-old girl). Oral LD 50 in animals (mg/kg): mice, 1100 to 3750; rats, 3850 to 4025; rabbits, 1500 to 2680; guinea pigs, 920. Signs and Symptoms The first 
signs and symptoms appear after 1 to 3 hours. Neuromuscular disturbances are the most prominent. Cardiovascular disorders are generally milder, and severe cardiac complications occur only when very 
high doses (>60 g) have been ingested. Respiration: Irregular breathing, respiratory depression. Cardiovascular System: Tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension, shock, conduction disorders. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Nervous System and Muscles: Impairment of consciousness ranging in severity to deep coma. Convulsions, especially in small children. Motor restlessness, muscular twitching, 
tremor, athetoid movements, opisthotonos, ataxia, drowsiness, dizziness, mydriasis, nystagmus, adiadochokinesia, ballism, psychomotor disturbances, dysmetria. Initial hyperreflexia, followed by 
hyporeflexia. Gastrointestinal Tract: Nausea, vomiting. Kidneys and Bladder: Anuria or oliguria, urinary retention. Laboratory Findings: Isolated instances of overdosage have included leukocytosis, 
reduced leukocyte count, glycosuria, and acetonuria. ECG may show dysrhythmias. CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Combined Poisoning: When alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, or hydantoins are 
taken at the same time, the signs and symptoms of acute poisoning with carbamazepine may be aggravated or modified. Treatment For the most up to date information on management of carbamazepine 
overdose, please contact the poison center for your area by calling 1-800-222-1222. The prognosis in cases of carbamazepine poisoning is generally favorable. Of 5,645 cases of carbamazepine exposures 
reported to US poison centers in 2002, a total of 8 deaths (0.14% mortality rate) occurred. Over 39% of the cases reported to these poison centers were managed safely at home with conservative care. 
Successful management of large or intentional carbamazepine exposures requires implementation of supportive care, frequent monitoring of serum drug concentrations, as well as aggressive but 
appropriate gastric decontamination. CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Elimination of the Drug: The primary method for gastric decontamination of carbamazepine overdose is use of activated charcoal. For 
substantial recent ingestions, gastric lavage may also be considered. Administration of activated charcoal prior to hospital assessment has the potential to significantly reduce drug absorption. There
is no specific antidote. In overdose, absorption of carbamazepine may be prolonged and delayed. More than one dose of activated charcoal may be beneficial in patients that have evidence of continued 
absorption (e.g., rising serum carbamazepine levels). Measures to Accelerate Elimination: The data on use of dialysis to enhance elimination in carbamazepine is scarce. Dialysis, particularly high 
flux or high efficiency hemodialysis, may be considered in patients with severe carbamazepine poisoning associated with renal failure or in cases of status epilepticus, or where there are rising serum
drug levels and worsening clinical status despite appropriate supportive care and gastric decontamination.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: general_precautions: General Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made. Carbamazepine should be used with caution in patients with a
mixed seizure disorder that includes atypical absence seizures, since in these patients carbamazepine has been associated with increased frequency of generalized convulsions (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE
). Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance, including second- and third-degree atrioventricular (AV) 
block; cardiac, hepatic, or renal damage; adverse hematologic or hypersensitivity reaction to other drugs including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with 
carbamazepine. AV block, including second- and third-degree block, has been reported following carbamazepine treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG 
abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances. CARBAMAZEPINE: general_precautions: Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of hepatic failure, have 
been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS , Laboratory Tests ). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition, rare instances of vanishing 
bile duct syndrome have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance 
of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as multiorgan hypersensitivity/ DRESS and serious 
dermatologic reactions. As an example, there has been a report of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and in another case an association with fever and eosinophilia.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication 
Guide before taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of 
liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Patients should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, they must report any occurrence immediately to
their physicians. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use. CARBAMAZEPINE: 
information_for_patients: Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In the event a skin reaction should 
occur while taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS ). Patients should be advised that anaphylactic reactions and 
angioedema may occur during treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients to immediately report signs and symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the 
face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their healthcare provider. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: 
Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including carbamazepine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert 
for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern 
should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use 
of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products. Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive 
sedative effect. Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: WARNINGS Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk 
in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not 
drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 Allele 
Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of
an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in 
allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity. Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, 
Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, 
averaging 2 to 4%, but higher in some groups. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: HLA-B*1502 is present in <1% of the population in Japan and Korea. HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian 
origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans). Prior to initiating carbamazepine extended-release capsules therapy, testing for HLA-B*1502 should be performed in 
patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA-B*1502 may be present. In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, 
keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. 
Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: WARNINGS Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk 
in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not 
drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 Allele 
Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of
an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in 
allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity. Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, 
Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, 
averaging 2 to 4%, but higher in some groups. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: HLA-B*1502 is present in <1% of the population in Japan and Korea. HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian 
origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans). Prior to initiating carbamazepine extended-release capsules therapy, testing for HLA-B*1502 should be performed in 
patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA-B*1502 may be present. In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, 
keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. 
Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: WARNING SERIOUS DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS AND HLA-B*1502 ALLELE SERIOUS AND SOMETIMES FATAL DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS, INCLUDING TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS (TEN) AND 
STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME (SJS), HAVE BEEN REPORTED DURING TREATMENT WITH CARBAMAZEPINE. THESE REACTIONS ARE ESTIMATED TO OCCUR IN 1 TO 6 PER 10,000 NEW USERS IN COUNTRIES WITH MAINLY CAUCASIAN 
POPULATIONS, BUT THE RISK IN SOME ASIAN COUNTRIES IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 10 TIMES HIGHER. CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: STUDIES IN PATIENTS OF CHINESE ANCESTRY HAVE FOUND A STRONG ASSOCIATION 
BETWEEN THE RISK OF DEVELOPING SJS/TEN AND THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502, AN INHERITED ALLELIC VARIANT OF THE HLA-B GENE. HLA-B*1502 IS FOUND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY ACROSS BROAD 
AREAS OF ASIA. PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY IN GENETICALLY AT-RISK POPULATIONS SHOULD BE SCREENED FOR THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502 PRIOR TO INITIATING TREATMENT WITH CARBAMAZEPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: PATIENTS TESTING POSITIVE FOR THE ALLELE SHOULD NOT BE TREATED WITH CARBAMAZEPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES UNLESS THE BENEFIT CLEARLY OUTWEIGHS THE RISK ( SEE WARNINGS 
AND PRECAUTIONS/LABORATORY TESTS ). APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF CARBAMAZEPINE. DATA FROM A 
POPULATION-BASED CASE-CONTROL STUDY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RISK OF DEVELOPING THESE REACTIONS IS 5 to 8 TIMES GREATER THAN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE Acute Toxicity Lowest known lethal dose: adults, >60 g (39-year-old man). Highest known doses survived: adults, 30 g (31-year-old woman); children, 10 g 
(6-year-old boy); small children, 5 g (3-year-old girl). Oral LD 50 in animals (mg/kg): mice, 1100 to 3750; rats, 3850 to 4025; rabbits, 1500 to 2680; guinea pigs, 920. Signs and Symptoms The first 
signs and symptoms appear after 1 to 3 hours. Neuromuscular disturbances are the most prominent. Cardiovascular disorders are generally milder, and severe cardiac complications occur only when very 
high doses (>60 g) have been ingested. Respiration: Irregular breathing, respiratory depression. Cardiovascular System: Tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension, shock, conduction disorders. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Nervous System and Muscles: Impairment of consciousness ranging in severity to deep coma. Convulsions, especially in small children. Motor restlessness, muscular twitching, 
tremor, athetoid movements, opisthotonos, ataxia, drowsiness, dizziness, mydriasis, nystagmus, adiadochokinesia, ballism, psychomotor disturbances, dysmetria. Initial hyperreflexia, followed by 
hyporeflexia. Gastrointestinal Tract: Nausea, vomiting. Kidneys and Bladder: Anuria or oliguria, urinary retention. Laboratory Findings: Isolated instances of overdosage have included leukocytosis, 
reduced leukocyte count, glycosuria, and acetonuria. ECG may show dysrhythmias. CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Combined Poisoning: When alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, or hydantoins are 
taken at the same time, the signs and symptoms of acute poisoning with carbamazepine may be aggravated or modified. Treatment For the most up to date information on management of carbamazepine 
overdose, please contact the poison center for your area by calling 1-800-222-1222. The prognosis in cases of carbamazepine poisoning is generally favorable. Of 5,645 cases of carbamazepine exposures 
reported to US poison centers in 2002, a total of 8 deaths (0.14% mortality rate) occurred. Over 39% of the cases reported to these poison centers were managed safely at home with conservative care. 
Successful management of large or intentional carbamazepine exposures requires implementation of supportive care, frequent monitoring of serum drug concentrations, as well as aggressive but 
appropriate gastric decontamination. CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Elimination of the Drug: The primary method for gastric decontamination of carbamazepine overdose is use of activated charcoal. For 
substantial recent ingestions, gastric lavage may also be considered. Administration of activated charcoal prior to hospital assessment has the potential to significantly reduce drug absorption. There
is no specific antidote. In overdose, absorption of carbamazepine may be prolonged and delayed. More than one dose of activated charcoal may be beneficial in patients that have evidence of continued 
absorption (e.g., rising serum carbamazepine levels). Measures to Accelerate Elimination: The data on use of dialysis to enhance elimination in carbamazepine is scarce. Dialysis, particularly high 
flux or high efficiency hemodialysis, may be considered in patients with severe carbamazepine poisoning associated with renal failure or in cases of status epilepticus, or where there are rising serum
drug levels and worsening clinical status despite appropriate supportive care and gastric decontamination.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: general_precautions: General Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made. Carbamazepine should be used with caution in patients with a
mixed seizure disorder that includes atypical absence seizures, since in these patients carbamazepine has been associated with increased frequency of generalized convulsions (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE
). Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance, including second- and third-degree atrioventricular (AV) 
block; cardiac, hepatic, or renal damage; adverse hematologic or hypersensitivity reaction to other drugs including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with 
carbamazepine. AV block, including second- and third-degree block, has been reported following carbamazepine treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG 
abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances. CARBAMAZEPINE: general_precautions: Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of hepatic failure, have 
been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS , Laboratory Tests ). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition, rare instances of vanishing 
bile duct syndrome have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance 
of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as multiorgan hypersensitivity/ DRESS and serious 
dermatologic reactions. As an example, there has been a report of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and in another case an association with fever and eosinophilia.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication 
Guide before taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of 
liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Patients should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, they must report any occurrence immediately to
their physicians. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use. CARBAMAZEPINE: 
information_for_patients: Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In the event a skin reaction should 
occur while taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS ). Patients should be advised that anaphylactic reactions and 
angioedema may occur during treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients to immediately report signs and symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the 
face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their healthcare provider. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: 
Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including carbamazepine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert 
for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern 
should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use 
of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products. Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive 
sedative effect. Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks.

(SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk 
in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not 
drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 Allele 
Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of
an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in 
allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity. Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, 
Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, 
averaging 2 to 4%, but higher in some groups. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: HLA-B*1502 is present in <1% of the population in Japan and Korea. HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian 
origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans). Prior to initiating carbamazepine extended-release capsules therapy, testing for HLA-B*1502 should be performed in 
patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA-B*1502 may be present. In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, 
keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. 
Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: WARNING SERIOUS DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS AND HLA-B*1502 ALLELE SERIOUS AND SOMETIMES FATAL DERMATOLOGIC REACTIONS, INCLUDING TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS (TEN) AND 
STEVENS-JOHNSON SYNDROME (SJS), HAVE BEEN REPORTED DURING TREATMENT WITH CARBAMAZEPINE. THESE REACTIONS ARE ESTIMATED TO OCCUR IN 1 TO 6 PER 10,000 NEW USERS IN COUNTRIES WITH MAINLY CAUCASIAN 
POPULATIONS, BUT THE RISK IN SOME ASIAN COUNTRIES IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 10 TIMES HIGHER. CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: STUDIES IN PATIENTS OF CHINESE ANCESTRY HAVE FOUND A STRONG ASSOCIATION 
BETWEEN THE RISK OF DEVELOPING SJS/TEN AND THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502, AN INHERITED ALLELIC VARIANT OF THE HLA-B GENE. HLA-B*1502 IS FOUND ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY ACROSS BROAD 
AREAS OF ASIA. PATIENTS WITH ANCESTRY IN GENETICALLY AT-RISK POPULATIONS SHOULD BE SCREENED FOR THE PRESENCE OF HLA-B*1502 PRIOR TO INITIATING TREATMENT WITH CARBAMAZEPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: boxed_warning: PATIENTS TESTING POSITIVE FOR THE ALLELE SHOULD NOT BE TREATED WITH CARBAMAZEPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE CAPSULES UNLESS THE BENEFIT CLEARLY OUTWEIGHS THE RISK ( SEE WARNINGS 
AND PRECAUTIONS/LABORATORY TESTS ). APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS APLASTIC ANEMIA AND AGRANULOCYTOSIS HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE USE OF CARBAMAZEPINE. DATA FROM A 
POPULATION-BASED CASE-CONTROL STUDY DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RISK OF DEVELOPING THESE REACTIONS IS 5 to 8 TIMES GREATER THAN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE Acute Toxicity Lowest known lethal dose: adults, >60 g (39-year-old man). Highest known doses survived: adults, 30 g (31-year-old woman); children, 10 g 
(6-year-old boy); small children, 5 g (3-year-old girl). Oral LD 50 in animals (mg/kg): mice, 1100 to 3750; rats, 3850 to 4025; rabbits, 1500 to 2680; guinea pigs, 920. Signs and Symptoms The first 
signs and symptoms appear after 1 to 3 hours. Neuromuscular disturbances are the most prominent. Cardiovascular disorders are generally milder, and severe cardiac complications occur only when very 
high doses (>60 g) have been ingested. Respiration: Irregular breathing, respiratory depression. Cardiovascular System: Tachycardia, hypotension or hypertension, shock, conduction disorders. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Nervous System and Muscles: Impairment of consciousness ranging in severity to deep coma. Convulsions, especially in small children. Motor restlessness, muscular twitching, 
tremor, athetoid movements, opisthotonos, ataxia, drowsiness, dizziness, mydriasis, nystagmus, adiadochokinesia, ballism, psychomotor disturbances, dysmetria. Initial hyperreflexia, followed by 
hyporeflexia. Gastrointestinal Tract: Nausea, vomiting. Kidneys and Bladder: Anuria or oliguria, urinary retention. Laboratory Findings: Isolated instances of overdosage have included leukocytosis, 
reduced leukocyte count, glycosuria, and acetonuria. ECG may show dysrhythmias. CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Combined Poisoning: When alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, or hydantoins are 
taken at the same time, the signs and symptoms of acute poisoning with carbamazepine may be aggravated or modified. Treatment For the most up to date information on management of carbamazepine 
overdose, please contact the poison center for your area by calling 1-800-222-1222. The prognosis in cases of carbamazepine poisoning is generally favorable. Of 5,645 cases of carbamazepine exposures 
reported to US poison centers in 2002, a total of 8 deaths (0.14% mortality rate) occurred. Over 39% of the cases reported to these poison centers were managed safely at home with conservative care. 
Successful management of large or intentional carbamazepine exposures requires implementation of supportive care, frequent monitoring of serum drug concentrations, as well as aggressive but 
appropriate gastric decontamination. CARBAMAZEPINE: overdosage: Elimination of the Drug: The primary method for gastric decontamination of carbamazepine overdose is use of activated charcoal. For 
substantial recent ingestions, gastric lavage may also be considered. Administration of activated charcoal prior to hospital assessment has the potential to significantly reduce drug absorption. There
is no specific antidote. In overdose, absorption of carbamazepine may be prolonged and delayed. More than one dose of activated charcoal may be beneficial in patients that have evidence of continued 
absorption (e.g., rising serum carbamazepine levels). Measures to Accelerate Elimination: The data on use of dialysis to enhance elimination in carbamazepine is scarce. Dialysis, particularly high 
flux or high efficiency hemodialysis, may be considered in patients with severe carbamazepine poisoning associated with renal failure or in cases of status epilepticus, or where there are rising serum
drug levels and worsening clinical status despite appropriate supportive care and gastric decontamination.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: general_precautions: General Before initiating therapy, a detailed history and physical examination should be made. Carbamazepine should be used with caution in patients with a
mixed seizure disorder that includes atypical absence seizures, since in these patients carbamazepine has been associated with increased frequency of generalized convulsions (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE
). Therapy should be prescribed only after critical benefit-to-risk appraisal in patients with a history of cardiac conduction disturbance, including second- and third-degree atrioventricular (AV) 
block; cardiac, hepatic, or renal damage; adverse hematologic or hypersensitivity reaction to other drugs including reactions to other anticonvulsants; or interrupted courses of therapy with 
carbamazepine. AV block, including second- and third-degree block, has been reported following carbamazepine treatment. This occurred generally, but not solely, in patients with underlying EKG 
abnormalities or risk factors for conduction disturbances. CARBAMAZEPINE: general_precautions: Hepatic effects, ranging from slight elevations in liver enzymes to rare cases of hepatic failure, have 
been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS , Laboratory Tests ). In some cases, hepatic effects may progress despite discontinuation of the drug. In addition, rare instances of vanishing 
bile duct syndrome have been reported. This syndrome consists of a cholestatic process with a variable clinical course ranging from fulminant to indolent, involving the destruction and disappearance 
of the intrahepatic bile ducts. Some, but not all, cases are associated with features that overlap with other immunoallergenic syndromes such as multiorgan hypersensitivity/ DRESS and serious 
dermatologic reactions. As an example, there has been a report of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome and in another case an association with fever and eosinophilia.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication 
Guide before taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of 
liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Patients should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, they must report any occurrence immediately to
their physicians. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use. CARBAMAZEPINE: 
information_for_patients: Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In the event a skin reaction should 
occur while taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS ). Patients should be advised that anaphylactic reactions and 
angioedema may occur during treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients to immediately report signs and symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the 
face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their healthcare provider. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: 
Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including carbamazepine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert 
for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern 
should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use 
of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products. Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive 
sedative effect. Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks.
