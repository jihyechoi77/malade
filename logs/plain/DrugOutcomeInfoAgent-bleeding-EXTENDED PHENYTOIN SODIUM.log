CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy
Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal 
hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been
reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, 
including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and 
other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy:
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an 
approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital 
hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral 
Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected 
phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary 
in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to
vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans 
according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those 
with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating 
phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 13 
Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations

including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic 
women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN 
SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero 
. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug’s 
inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of 
phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as “delirium,” “psychosis,” or “encephalopathy,” or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or 
cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy 
is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.

        Question: Does EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increase or decrease the risk of bleeding?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.
2. FDAHandler responded that EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of bleeding, specifically in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder 
related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in these newborns. This condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the 
neonate after birth.
3. The source of this information is the EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label.
        -----
        Final answer: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This increased risk is associated with a potentially 
life-threatening bleeding disorder due to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. The risk can be mitigated by administering vitamin K to the mother before delivery and to the 
neonate after birth.

EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This increased risk is associated with a potentially life-threatening bleeding 
disorder due to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. The risk can be mitigated by administering vitamin K to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. This 
information is sourced from the EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label.
