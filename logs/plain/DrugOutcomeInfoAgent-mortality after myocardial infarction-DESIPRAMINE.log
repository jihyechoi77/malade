CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and 
risks associated with treatment with desipramine hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious 
Mental illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for desipramine hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to 
read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any 
questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if 
these occur while taking desipramine hydrochloride. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to 
the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in 
behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be 
advised to observe for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, 
especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and 
behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Patients should be advised that taking desipramine hydrochloride can cause mild
pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle closure glaucoma, when 
diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open- angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible
to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established ( see BOX 
WARNING and WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Therefore, desipramine hydrochloride is not recommended for use in children. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Anyone considering the use of 
desipramine hydrochloride in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need (see also ADVERSE REACTIONS- Cardiovascular ). General It is important that this drug be 
dispensed in the least possible quantities to depressed outpatients, since suicide has been accomplished with this class of drug ( see WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Ordinary prudence
requires that children not have access to this drug or to potent drugs of any kind; if possible, this drug should be dispensed in containers with child-resistant safety closures. Storage of this drug 
in the home must be supervised responsibly. If serious adverse effects occur, dosage should be reduced or treatment should be altered. Desipramine hydrochloride therapy in patients with 
manic-depressive illness may induce a hypomanic state after the depressive phase terminates. The drug may cause exacerbation of psychosis in schizophrenic patients. Both elevation and lowering of 
blood sugar levels have been reported. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Leukocyte and differential counts should be performed in any patient who develops fever and sore throat during therapy; the drug should
be discontinued if there is evidence of pathologic neutrophil depression. Clinical experience in the concurrent administration of ECT and antidepressant drugs is limited. Thus, if such treatment is 
essential, the possibility of increased risk relative to benefits should be considered. This drug should be discontinued as soon as possible prior to elective surgery because of possible 
cardiovascular effects. Hypertensive episodes have been observed during surgery in patients taking desipramine hydrochloride.

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: boxed_warning: Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, 
adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of desipramine hydrochloride tablets or any other 
antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants 
compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are 
themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical 
worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. DESIPRAMINE: boxed_warning: Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. 
Desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients ( See WARNINGS: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk , PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients , and PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use .

depression and other illnesses . DESIPRAMINE: spl_medguide: It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it. Patients and their families or other

ANSWER: Desipramine hydrochloride is an antidepressant drug of the tricyclic type. It is used to treat symptoms of depression and is available in various dosages ranging from 10 mg to 150 mg. Patients
and healthcare providers should be aware of the risk of increased suicidal thoughts and behavior, particularly in children, adolescents, and young adults. It is not approved for pediatric use due to 
the risk of clinical worsening and suicide. Desipramine can cause mild pupillary dilation, which may lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma in susceptible individuals. The drug should be used 
with caution in patients with a history of manic-depressive illness, schizophrenia, and those with altered blood sugar levels. Adverse reactions can include cardiovascular issues such as hypotension, 
hypertension, and arrhythmias, psychiatric effects like confusion and hallucinations, neurologic symptoms such as tremors and seizures, anticholinergic effects like dry mouth and blurred vision, 
allergic reactions, hematologic issues like bone marrow depression, gastrointestinal problems, and endocrine changes like gynecomastia.

The information provided by FDAHandler from the DESIPRAMINE label did not specifically mention the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, it is not 
possible to determine whether DESIPRAMINE increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
