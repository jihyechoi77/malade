CONTENT: ABELCET: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate patients), 
of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 patients were 
treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with ABELCET ® , 9% 
discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient chills and/or fever 
during infusion of the drug. ABELCET: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14 Increased Serum Creatinine 11

CONTENT: ABELCET: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended daily dosage for adults and children is 5 mg/kg given as a single infusion. ABELCET ® should be administered by 
intravenous infusion at a rate of 2.5 mg/kg/h. If the infusion time exceeds 2 hours, mix the contents by shaking the infusion bag every 2 hours. Renal toxicity of ABELCET ® , as measured by serum 
creatinine levels, has been shown to be dose dependent. Decisions about dose adjustments should be made only after taking into account the overall clinical condition of the patient. Preparation of 
Admixture for Infusion: Shake the vial gently until there is no evidence of any yellow sediment at the bottom. Withdraw the appropriate dose of ABELCET ® from the required number of vials into one or 
more sterile syringes using an 18-gauge needle. ABELCET: dosage_and_administration: Remove the needle from each syringe filled with ABELCET ® and replace with the 5-micron filter needle supplied with 
each vial. Each filter needle may be used to filter the contents of up to four 100 mg vials. Insert the filter needle of the syringe into an IV bag containing 5% Dextrose Injection USP, and empty the 
contents of the syringe into the bag. The final infusion concentration should be 1 mg/mL. For pediatric patients and patients with cardiovascular disease the drug may be diluted with 5% Dextrose 
Injection to a final infusion concentration of 2 mg/mL. Before infusion, shake the bag until the contents are thoroughly mixed. Do not use the admixture after dilution with 5% Dextrose Injection if 
there is any evidence of foreign matter. Vials are for single use. Unused material should be discarded. ABELCET: dosage_and_administration: Aseptic technique must be strictly observed throughout 
handling of ABELCET ® , since no bacteriostatic agent or preservative is present. DO NOT DILUTE WITH SALINE SOLUTIONS OR MIX WITH OTHER DRUGS OR ELECTROLYTES as the compatibility of ABELCET ® with 
these materials has not been established. An existing intravenous line should be flushed with 5% Dextrose Injection before infusion of ABELCET ® , or a separate infusion line should be used. DO NOT 
USE AN IN-LINE FILTER. The diluted ready-for-use admixture is stable for up to 48 hours at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F) and an additional 6 hours at room temperature.

CONTENT: ABELCET: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics The assay used to measure amphotericin B in the blood after the administration of ABELCET ® does not distinguish 
amphotericin B that is complexed with the phospholipids of ABELCET ® from amphotericin B that is uncomplexed. The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B after the administration of ABELCET ® are 
nonlinear. Volume of distribution and clearance from blood increase with increasing dose of ABELCET ® , resulting in less than proportional increases in blood concentrations of amphotericin B over a 
dose range of 0.6-5 mg/kg/day. ABELCET: clinical_pharmacology: The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B in whole blood after the administration of ABELCET ® and amphotericin B desoxycholate are:

CONTENT: ABELCET: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions: No formal clinical studies of drug interactions have been conducted with ABELCET ® . However, when administered concomitantly, the following 
drugs are known to interact with amphotericin B; therefore, the following drugs may interact with ABELCET ® : Antineoplastic agents: Concurrent use of antineoplastic agents and amphotericin B may 
enhance the potential for renal toxicity, bronchospasm, and hypotension. Antineoplastic agents should be given concomitantly with ABELCET ® with great caution. Corticosteroids and corticotropin 
(ACTH): Concurrent use of corticosteroids and corticotropin (ACTH) with amphotericin B may potentiate hypokalemia which could predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction. If used concomitantly with 
ABELCET ® , serum electrolytes and cardiac function should be closely monitored. ABELCET: drug_interactions: Cyclosporin A: Data from a prospective study of prophylactic ABELCET ® in 22 patients 
undergoing bone marrow transplantation suggested that concurrent initiation of cyclosporin A and ABELCET ® within several days of bone marrow ablation may be associated with increased nephrotoxicity. 
Digitalis glycosides: Concurrent use of amphotericin B may induce hypokalemia and may potentiate digitalis toxicity. When administered concomitantly with ABELCET ® , serum potassium levels should be 
closely monitored. Flucytosine : Concurrent use of flucytosine with amphotericin B-containing preparations may increase the toxicity of flucytosine by possibly increasing its cellular uptake and/or 
impairing its renal excretion. Flucytosine should be given concomitantly with ABELCET ® with caution. Imidazoles (e.g. ABELCET: drug_interactions: ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, fluconazole, 
etc.): Antagonism between amphotericin B and imidazole derivatives such as miconazole and ketoconazole, which inhibit ergosterol synthesis, has been reported in both in vitro and in vivo animal 
studies. The clinical significance of these findings has not been determined. Leukocyte transfusions: Acute pulmonary toxicity has been reported in patients receiving intravenous amphotericin B and 
leukocyte transfusions. Leukocyte transfusions and ABELCET ® should not be given concurrently. Other nephrotoxic medications : Concurrent use of amphotericin B and agents such as aminoglcosides and 
pentamidine may enhance the potential for drug-induced renal toxicity. Aminoglycosides and pentamidine should be used concomitantly with ABELCET ® only with great caution. ABELCET: drug_interactions: 
Intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended in patients requiring any combination of nephrotoxic medications. Skeletal muscle relaxants: Amphotericin B-induced hypokalemia may enhance the 
curariform effect of skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g., tubocurarine) due to hypokalemia. When administered concomitantly with ABELCET ® , serum potassium levels should be closely monitored. Zidovudine:
Increased myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were observed in dogs when either ABELCET ® (at doses 0.16 or 0.5 times the recommended human dose) or amphotericin B desoxycholate (at 0.5 times the 
recommended human dose) were administered concomitantly with zidovudine for 30 days. If zidovudine is used concomitantly with ABELCET ® , renal and hematologic function should be closely monitored. 
ABELCET: precautions: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: No long-term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ABELCET ® . The following 
in vitro (with and without metabolic activation) and in vivo studies to assess ABELCET ® for mutagenic potential were conducted: bacterial reverse mutation assay, mouse lymphoma forward mutation 
assay, chromosomal aberration assay in CHO cells, and in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. ABELCET ® was found to be without mutagenic effects in all assay systems. Studies demonstrated that ABELCET ® 
had no impact on fertility in male and female rats at doses up to 0.32 times the recommended human dose (based on body surface area considerations). Pregnancy: There are no reports of pregnant women 
having been treated with ABELCET ® . Teratogenic Effects. ABELCET: precautions: Reproductive studies in rats and rabbits at doses of ABELCET ® up to 0.64 times the human dose revealed no harm to the 
fetus. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, and adequate and well-controlled studies have not been conducted in pregnant women, ABELCET ® should be used 
during pregnancy only after taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether ABELCET ® is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted 
in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants from ABELCET ® , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, 
taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. ABELCET: precautions: Pediatric Use: One hundred eleven children (2 were enrolled twice and counted as separate patients), age 16 years 
and under, of whom 11 were less than 1 year, have been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, prospective, single-arm study. In one single-center study, 5 
children with hepatosplenic candidiasis were effectively treated with 2.5 mg/kg/day of ABELCET ® . No serious unexpected adverse events have been reported. Geriatric Use: Forty-nine elderly patients, 
age 65 years or over, have been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, prospective, single-arm study. No serious unexpected adverse events have been reported.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.
2. FDAHandler responded that the ABELCET label does not specifically mention aplastic anemia as a risk associated with its use. The label does list various hematologic issues such as anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, but aplastic anemia is not explicitly stated. The causal association between these adverse events and ABELCET is uncertain.
        -----
        Final answer: The risk of aplastic anemia associated with ABELCET is not specified in the FDA label, and therefore it is not known whether ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of aplastic 
anemia.
