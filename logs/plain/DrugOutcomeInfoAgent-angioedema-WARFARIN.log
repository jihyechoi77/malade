CONTENT: WARFARIN: contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in: Pregnancy Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with 
mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of thromboembolism  . Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a 
recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If warfarin 
sodium is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus  . WARFARIN: contraindications: Warfarin 
sodium is contraindicated in patients with: Hemorrhagic tendencies or blood dyscrasias Recent or contemplated surgery of the central nervous system or eye, or traumatic surgery resulting in large open
surfaces  Bleeding tendencies associated with: − Active ulceration or overt bleeding of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or respiratory tract − Central nervous system hemorrhage − Cerebral

CONTENT: WARFARIN: clinical_pharmacology: Absorption Warfarin is essentially completely absorbed after oral administration, with peak concentration generally attained within the first 4 hours. 
Distribution Warfarin shows a volume of distribution of about 0.14 L/kg. Approximately 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. Metabolism The elimination of warfarin is almost entirely by 
metabolism. Warfarin is stereoselectively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) microsomal enzymes to inactive hydroxylated metabolites (predominant route) and by reductases to reduced 
metabolites (warfarin alcohols) with minimal anticoagulant activity. Identified metabolites of warfarin include dehydrowarfarin, two diastereoisomer alcohols, and 4′-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 10- 
hydroxywarfarin. WARFARIN: clinical_pharmacology: The CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme, is likely to 
be the principal form of human liver CYP450 that modulates the in vivo anticoagulant activity of warfarin. Patients with one or more variant CYP2C9 alleles have decreased S-warfarin clearance  . 
Excretion The terminal half-life of warfarin after a single dose is approximately 1 week; however, the effective half-life ranges from 20 to 60 hours, with a mean of about 40 hours. WARFARIN: 
clinical_pharmacology: The clearance of R-warfarin is generally half that of S-warfarin, thus as the volumes of distribution are similar, the half-life of R-warfarin is longer than that of S-warfarin.
The half-life of R-warfarin ranges from 37 to 89 hours, while that of S-warfarin ranges from 21 to 43 hours. Studies with radiolabeled drug have demonstrated that up to 92% of the orally administered 
dose is recovered in urine. Very little warfarin is excreted unchanged in urine. Urinary excretion is in the form of metabolites. Geriatric Patients Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit 
greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin. The cause of the increased sensitivity to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in this age group is unknown but may be due
to a combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. WARFARIN: clinical_pharmacology: Limited information suggests there is no difference in the clearance of S-warfarin; however, there may
be a slight decrease in the clearance of R-warfarin in the elderly as compared to the young. Therefore, as patient age increases, a lower dose of warfarin is usually required to produce a therapeutic 
level of anticoagulation . Asian Patients Asian patients may require lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin. A non-controlled study of 151 Chinese outpatients stabilized on warfarin for 
various indications reported a mean daily warfarin requirement of 3.3 ± 1.4 mg to achieve an INR of 2 to 2.5. Patient age was the most important determinant of warfarin requirement in these patients, 
with a progressively lower warfarin requirement with increasing age. 12. WARFARIN: clinical_pharmacology: 5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Polymorphisms The S -enantiomer of warfarin is mainly 
metabolized to 7-hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme. The variant alleles, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, result in decreased in vitro CYP2C9 enzymatic 7-hydroxylation of S-warfarin. The 
frequencies of these alleles in Caucasians are approximately 11% and 7% for CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3, respectively. Other CYP2C9 alleles associated with reduced enzymatic activity occur at lower 
frequencies, including *5, *6, and *11 alleles in populations of African ancestry and *5, *9, and *11 alleles in Caucasians.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: spl_medguide: MEDICATION GUIDE Dispense with Medication Guide available at: www.tevausa.com/medguides Warfarin (war' far in) Sodium (soe' dee um) Tablets What is the most important 
information I should know about warfarin sodium tablets? Warfarin sodium tablets can cause bleeding which can be serious and sometimes lead to death. This is because warfarin sodium tablets are a 
blood thinner medicine that lowers the chance of blood clots forming in your body. WARFARIN: spl_medguide: You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take warfarin sodium tablets and: are 65 years 
of age or older have a history of stomach or intestinal bleeding have high blood pressure (hypertension) have a history of stroke, or “mini-stroke” (transient ischemic attack or TIA) have serious 
heart disease have a low blood count or cancer have had trauma, such as an accident or surgery have kidney problems take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including: a medicine that
contains heparin other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) take warfarin sodium for a long time. Warfarin sodium is the active ingredient in 
warfarin sodium tablets. Tell your healthcare provider if you take any of these medicines. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above. WARFARIN: 
spl_medguide: Many other medicines can interact with warfarin sodium tablets and affect the dose you need or increase warfarin sodium tablets side effects. Do not change or stop any of your medicines 
or start any new medicines before you talk to your healthcare provider. Do not take other medicines that contain warfarin sodium while taking warfarin sodium tablets. Get your regular blood test to 
check for your response to warfarin sodium tablets. This blood test is called an INR test. The INR test checks to see how fast your blood clots. Your healthcare provider will decide what INR numbers 
are best for you. Your dose of warfarin sodium tablets will be adjusted to keep your INR in a target range for you. WARFARIN: spl_medguide: Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of 
the following signs or symptoms of bleeding problems: pain, swelling, or discomfort headaches, dizziness, or weakness unusual bruising (bruises that develop without known cause or grow in size) 
nosebleeds bleeding gums bleeding from cuts takes a long time to stop menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal pink or brown urine red or black stools coughing up blood 
vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds Some foods and beverages can interact with warfarin sodium tablets and affect your treatment and dose. Eat a normal, balanced diet. Talk to 
your healthcare provider before you make any diet changes. Do not eat large amounts of leafy, green vegetables. Leafy, green vegetables contain vitamin K. Certain vegetable oils also contain large 
amounts of vitamin K. Too much vitamin K can lower the effect of warfarin sodium tablets. Always tell all of your healthcare providers that you take warfarin sodium tablets.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: drug_interactions: 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, antibiotics, antifungals, botanical (herbal) products, and inhibitors and inducers of 
CYP2C9, 1A2, or 3A4. ( 7 ) Consult labeling of all concurrently used drugs for complete information about interactions with warfarin sodium or increased risks for bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 General 
Information Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired
hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic 
mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: It is important to note that some
drugs may interact by more than one mechanism. More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, 
including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [ see Boxed Warning ]. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information 
about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding. 7.2 CYP450 Interactions CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 
1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 
3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin. Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease
INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin. Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2 ; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. 
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, 
stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer. Table 2: Examples of

antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin. Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic 
or antifungal in patients taking warfarin. 7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals. Few adequate, 
well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with 
botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. Some botanicals 
may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be
expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium (e.g., co-enzyme Q 10 , St. John’s wort, ginseng). Some
botanicals and foods can interact with warfarin sodium through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John’s wort). The amount of vitamin K in food may affect 
therapy with warfarin sodium. Advise patients taking warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic 
changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 5 to 2 mg † Ranges are derived from multiple published clinical studies. VKORC1−1639G > A (rs9923231) variant is used in this table. Other co-inherited 
VKORC1 variants may also be important determinants of warfarin dose. 2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation Warfarin sodium tablets have a narrow therapeutic range (index), and their action
may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during warfarin sodium tablets therapy. Determine the INR daily after the 
administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of
performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: Perform additional INR tests 
when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium tablets, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug,
increases the INR  . Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of warfarin sodium tablets therapy. 2.5 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment 
is necessary for patients with renal failure. Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range . 2.6 Missed Dose The anticoagulant 
effect of warfarin sodium tablets persists beyond 24 hours. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: If a patient misses a dose of warfarin sodium tablets at the intended time of day, the patient should 
take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose. 2.7 Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery Some dental or surgical 
procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of warfarin sodium tablets therapy. Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing warfarin sodium tablets even for a short period
of time. Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately 
following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium tablets to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation. 2. WARFARIN: 
dosage_and_administration: 8 Conversion From Other Anticoagulants Heparin Since the full anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium tablets is not achieved for several days, heparin is preferred for 
initial rapid anticoagulation. During initial therapy with warfarin sodium tablets, the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance. Conversion to warfarin sodium 
tablets may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure therapeutic anticoagulation, continue full dose heparin therapy and overlap warfarin sodium tablets 
therapy with heparin for 4 to 5 days and until warfarin sodium tablets has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by INR, at which point heparin may be discontinued. WARFARIN: 
dosage_and_administration: As heparin may affect the INR, patients receiving both heparin and warfarin sodium tablets should have INR monitoring at least: 5 hours after the last intravenous bolus dose
of heparin, or 4 hours after cessation of a continuous intravenous infusion of heparin, or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous heparin injection. Warfarin sodium tablets may increase the activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test, even in the absence of heparin. A severe elevation (> 50 seconds) in aPTT with an INR in the desired range has been identified as an indication of increased 
risk of postoperative hemorrhage. Other Anticoagulants Consult the labeling of other anticoagulants for instructions on conversion to warfarin sodium tablets.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue necrosis: Necrosis or gangrene of skin or other tissues can occur, with severe cases requiring debridement or amputation. 
Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulants if necessary. ( 5.2 ) Calciphylaxis: Fatal and serious cases have occurred. Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative 
anticoagulation therapy. ( 5.3 ) Acute kidney injury may occur during episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. ( 5.4 ) Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli: Some cases have 
progressed to necrosis or death. Discontinue warfarin sodium if such emboli occur. ( 5.5 ) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Initial therapy with warfarin sodium in HIT has resulted in cases of 
amputation and death. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Warfarin sodium may be considered after platelet count has normalized. ( 5.6 ) Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves: Warfarin sodium may 
cause fetal harm; however, the benefits may outweigh the risks. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk 
factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, 
cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors  , certain concomitant drugs  , and long duration of warfarin therapy. Perform regular monitoring of INR 
in all treated patients. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration 
of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding. Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR 
levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs  . Instruct 
patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding  . 5.2 Tissue Necrosis Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other
tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (<0.1%). WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin
sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported. Careful clinical evaluation is required to 
determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin 
sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.3 Calciphylaxis Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium 
uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat 
calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. 5. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Acute Kidney Injury In patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of
kidney disease, acute kidney injury may occur with warfarin sodium, possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria  . More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is 
advised in patients with compromised renal function. 5.5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque 
emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the 
kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as “purple toes syndrome.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: contraindications: 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in: Pregnancy Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with 
mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of thromboembolism  . Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a 
recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If warfarin 
sodium is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus  . WARFARIN: contraindications: Warfarin 
sodium is contraindicated in patients with: Hemorrhagic tendencies or blood dyscrasias Recent or contemplated surgery of the central nervous system or eye, or traumatic surgery resulting in large open
surfaces  Bleeding tendencies associated with: − Active ulceration or overt bleeding of the gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or respiratory tract − Central nervous system hemorrhage − Cerebral 
aneurysms, dissecting aorta − Pericarditis and pericardial effusions − Bacterial endocarditis Threatened abortion, eclampsia, and preeclampsia Unsupervised patients with conditions associated with 
potential high level of non-compliance Spinal puncture and other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding Hypersensitivity to warfarin or to any other components

CONTENT: WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue necrosis: Necrosis or gangrene of skin or other tissues can occur, with severe cases requiring debridement or amputation. 
Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulants if necessary. ( 5.2 ) Calciphylaxis: Fatal and serious cases have occurred. Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative 
anticoagulation therapy. ( 5.3 ) Acute kidney injury may occur during episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. ( 5.4 ) Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli: Some cases have 
progressed to necrosis or death. Discontinue warfarin sodium if such emboli occur. ( 5.5 ) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Initial therapy with warfarin sodium in HIT has resulted in cases of 
amputation and death. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Warfarin sodium may be considered after platelet count has normalized. ( 5.6 ) Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves: Warfarin sodium may 
cause fetal harm; however, the benefits may outweigh the risks. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk 
factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, 
cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors  , certain concomitant drugs  , and long duration of warfarin therapy. Perform regular monitoring of INR 
in all treated patients. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration 
of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding. Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR 
levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs  . Instruct 
patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding  . 5.2 Tissue Necrosis Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other
tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (<0.1%). WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin
sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported. Careful clinical evaluation is required to 
determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin 
sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.3 Calciphylaxis Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium 
uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat 
calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. 5. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Acute Kidney Injury In patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of
kidney disease, acute kidney injury may occur with warfarin sodium, possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria  . More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is 
advised in patients with compromised renal function. 5.5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque 
emboli. Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the 
kidneys followed by the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as “purple toes syndrome.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of 
thromboembolism, and for whom the benefits of warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks  . Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a 
pattern of congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Because these data were not collected in adequate and well-controlled studies, this incidence of major birth defects is not an 
adequate basis for comparison to the estimated incidences in the control group or the U.S. general population and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. Consider the benefits and risks 
of warfarin sodium and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing warfarin sodium to a pregnant woman. WARFARIN: pregnancy: Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother
or the use of medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk 
of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions In humans, warfarin 
crosses the placenta, and concentrations in fetal plasma approach the maternal values. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in 
about 5% of exposed offspring. Warfarin embryopathy is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata) and growth retardation (including low birth 
weight). WARFARIN: pregnancy: Central nervous system and eye abnormalities have also been reported, including dorsal midline dysplasia characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker 
malformation, midline cerebellar atrophy, and ventral midline dysplasia characterized by optic atrophy. Mental retardation, blindness, schizencephaly, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and other adverse 
pregnancy outcomes have been reported following warfarin exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy  .

CONTENT: WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 5 to 2 mg † Ranges are derived from multiple published clinical studies. VKORC1−1639G > A (rs9923231) variant is used in this table. Other co-inherited 
VKORC1 variants may also be important determinants of warfarin dose. 2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation Warfarin sodium tablets have a narrow therapeutic range (index), and their action
may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during warfarin sodium tablets therapy. Determine the INR daily after the 
administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of
performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: Perform additional INR tests 
when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium tablets, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug,
increases the INR  . Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of warfarin sodium tablets therapy. 2.5 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment 
is necessary for patients with renal failure. Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range . 2.6 Missed Dose The anticoagulant 
effect of warfarin sodium tablets persists beyond 24 hours. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: If a patient misses a dose of warfarin sodium tablets at the intended time of day, the patient should 
take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose. 2.7 Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery Some dental or surgical 
procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of warfarin sodium tablets therapy. Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing warfarin sodium tablets even for a short period
of time. Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately 
following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium tablets to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation. 2. WARFARIN: 
dosage_and_administration: 8 Conversion From Other Anticoagulants Heparin Since the full anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium tablets is not achieved for several days, heparin is preferred for 
initial rapid anticoagulation. During initial therapy with warfarin sodium tablets, the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance. Conversion to warfarin sodium 
tablets may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure therapeutic anticoagulation, continue full dose heparin therapy and overlap warfarin sodium tablets 
therapy with heparin for 4 to 5 days and until warfarin sodium tablets has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by INR, at which point heparin may be discontinued. WARFARIN: 
dosage_and_administration: As heparin may affect the INR, patients receiving both heparin and warfarin sodium tablets should have INR monitoring at least: 5 hours after the last intravenous bolus dose
of heparin, or 4 hours after cessation of a continuous intravenous infusion of heparin, or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous heparin injection. Warfarin sodium tablets may increase the activated 
partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) test, even in the absence of heparin. A severe elevation (> 50 seconds) in aPTT with an INR in the desired range has been identified as an indication of increased 
risk of postoperative hemorrhage. Other Anticoagulants Consult the labeling of other anticoagulants for instructions on conversion to warfarin sodium tablets.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: clinical_studies: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Atrial Fibrillation In five prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials involving 3711 patients with non-rheumatic AF, warfarin 
significantly reduced the risk of systemic thromboembolism including stroke (see Table 4 ). The risk reduction ranged from 60% to 86% in all except one trial (CAFA: 45%), which was stopped early due 
to published positive results from two of these trials. The incidence of major bleeding in these trials ranged from 0.6% to 2.7% (see Table 4 ). Table 4: Clinical Studies of Warfarin in Non-Rheumatic

CONTENT: WARFARIN: drug_interactions: 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, antibiotics, antifungals, botanical (herbal) products, and inhibitors and inducers of 
CYP2C9, 1A2, or 3A4. ( 7 ) Consult labeling of all concurrently used drugs for complete information about interactions with warfarin sodium or increased risks for bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 General 
Information Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired
hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic 
mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: It is important to note that some
drugs may interact by more than one mechanism. More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, 
including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [ see Boxed Warning ]. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information 
about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding. 7.2 CYP450 Interactions CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 
1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 
3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin. Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease
INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin. Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2 ; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. 
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, 
stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer. Table 2: Examples of

CONTENT: WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications An INR of greater than 4 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in 
most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE) Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR 
range, 2 to 3) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows: For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment 
with warfarin for 3 months is recommended. For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit
ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. 
For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient. Atrial Fibrillation In patients with 
non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2 to 3). In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at high risk of stroke (i.e., having any of the
following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, or 2 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left 
ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: In 
patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at an intermediate risk of ischemic stroke (i.e., having 1 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or 
severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. For patients with AF 
and mitral stenosis, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended; the target INR 
may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves For patients with a 
bileaflet mechanical valve or a Medtronic Hall (Minneapolis, MN) tilting disk valve in the aortic position who are in sinus rhythm and without left atrial enlargement, therapy with warfarin to a 
target INR of 2.5 (range, 2 to 3) is recommended. For patients with tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3 (range, 2.5 
to 3.5) is recommended. For patients with caged ball or caged disk valves, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) is recommended. For patients with a bioprosthetic valve in the
mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 5 (range, 2 to 3) for the first 3 months after valve insertion is recommended. If additional risk 
factors for thromboembolism are present (AF, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction), a target INR of 2.5 (range 2 to 3) is recommended. Post-Myocardial Infarction For high-risk 
patients with MI (e.g., those with a large anterior MI, those with significant heart failure, those with intracardiac thrombus visible on transthoracic echocardiography, those with AF, and those with 
a history of a thromboembolic event), therapy with combined moderate-intensity (INR, 2 to 3) warfarin plus low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/day) for at least 3 months after the MI is recommended.

        Question: Does WARFARIN increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether WARFARIN increases the risk of angioedema and received a DO-NOT-KNOW response.
2. I asked FDAHandler whether WARFARIN decreases the risk of angioedema and received a DO-NOT-KNOW response.
3. These responses indicate that the FDA label for WARFARIN does not contain information about its effect on the risk of angioedema.

The FDA label for WARFARIN does not contain information about its effect on the risk of angioedema. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this data whether WARFARIN increases or decreases 
the risk of angioedema.
