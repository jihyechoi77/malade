CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs),
such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy 
Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal hydantoin 
syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported 
among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other 
manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: The 
background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to 
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
pregnancy: 4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia
has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 
mg/kg, respectively.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion  
Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus  Serious Dermatologic Reactions  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity  Hypersensitivity  
Hepatic Injury  Hematopoietic Complications  Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome)  Exacerbation of Porphyria  Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn  Hyperglycemia  The following 
adverse reactions associated with the use of Phenytoin Sodium Injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population
of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the 
intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
adverse_reactions: The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients 
. Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS  have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. 
There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and 
fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Severe complications are most commonly encountered in
elderly or critically ill patients  . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure  , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. 
Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin  . These have included thrombocytopenia, 
leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to 
folic acid therapy.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: information_for_patients: 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION W ithdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with 
their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus  . P otential Signs of Drug Reaction with 
Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic R eac tions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and
in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: information_for_patients: Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious 
reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after 
extended use  . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their 
physician’s advice  . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., cimetidine and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
information_for_patients: John’s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels  . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise 
patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause 
dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have 
become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: information_for_patients: Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of 
phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit 
hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. 
Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal 
contraceptive efficacy . Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or 
intend to breastfeed during therapy  . PHENYTOIN SODIUM: information_for_patients: Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become 
pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . Manufactured by: Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.

respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for 
Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
use_in_specific_populations: 4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally 
accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with 
rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin 
clearance tends to decrease with increasing age  . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required . 8.
