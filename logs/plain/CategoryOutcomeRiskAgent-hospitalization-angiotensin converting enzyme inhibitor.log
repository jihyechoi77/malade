                Passages:
                1. Drug LISINOPRIL: Lisinopril is likely to decrease the risk of hospitalization by lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, such as 
strokes and myocardial infarctions. This conclusion is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which states that lisinopril is indicated for the treatment of hypertension and has been shown 
in controlled trials to lower the risk of cardiovascular events by managing blood pressure.
2. Drug CAPTOPRIL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data for Captopril does not specify information about the risk of hospitalization associated with its use. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether Captopril increases or 
decreases the risk of hospitalization based on the available FDA label information.
3. Drug ENALAPRIL MALEATE: ENALAPRIL MALEATE decreases the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. This is based on the information 
provided by FDAHandler, which indicates that the drug is used for this specific purpose among its indications.

        Question: Does the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs increase the risk of hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 states that Lisinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, is likely to decrease the risk of hospitalization by lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of 
cardiovascular events.
2. Passage 2 does not provide information about Captopril's effect on hospitalization risk, so it cannot be used to determine the effect of the drug category.
3. Passage 3 indicates that Enalapril Maleate, another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, decreases the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular 
dysfunction.
4. Based on the information from passages 1 and 3, two out of three drugs mentioned (Lisinopril and Enalapril Maleate) are indicated to decrease the risk of hospitalization.
5. Since the information about Captopril is not available, it cannot contribute to the overall assessment of the category effect.
6. The evidence from the passages suggests that the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs has a decreasing effect on the risk of hospitalization.
        -----
        Final answer: The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs decreases the risk of hospitalization.
