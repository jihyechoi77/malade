CONTENT: BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Cyclosporine Avoid concurrent use There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration of BACTRIM and cyclosporine in renal 
transplant recipients. Digoxin Monitor serum digoxin levels Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Indomethacin Avoid concurrent use
Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving indomethacin. Pyrimethamine Avoid concurrent use Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine 
as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly may develop megaloblastic anemia if BACTRIM is prescribed. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) Monitor therapeutic response and adjust dose of TCA 
accordingly The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants can decrease when coadministered with BACTRIM. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Oral Hypoglycemics Monitor blood glucose more frequently Like other 
sulfonamide-containing drugs, BACTRIM potentiates the effect of oral hypoglycemic that are metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone) or CYP2C9 (e.g., glipizide and 
glyburide) or eliminated renally via OCT2 (e.g., metformin). Additional monitoring of blood glucose may be warranted. Amantadine Avoid concurrent use In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium
has been reported after concomitant intake of BACTRIM and amantadine (an OCT2 substrate). Cases of interactions with other OCT2 substrates, memantine and metformin, have also been reported. BACTRIM: 
drug_interactions: Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Avoid concurrent use In the literature, three cases of hyperkalemia in elderly patients have been reported after concomitant intake of 
BACTRIM and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. 5,6 Zidovudine Monitor for hematologic toxicity Zidovudine and BACTRIM are known to induce hematological abnormalities. Hence, there is 
potential for an additive myelotoxicity when coadministered. 7 Dofetilide Concurrent administration is contraindicated Elevated plasma concentrations of dofetilide have been reported following 
concurrent administration of trimethoprim and dofetilide. Increased plasma concentrations of dofetilide may cause serious ventricular arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation, including 
torsade de pointes . BACTRIM: drug_interactions: 8,9 Procainamide Closely monitor for clinical and ECG signs of procainamide toxicity and/or procainamide plasma concentration if available Trimethoprim
increases the plasma concentrations of procainamide and its active N-acetyl metabolite (NAPA) when trimethoprim and procainamide are coadministered. The increased procainamide and NAPA plasma 
concentrations that resulted from the pharmacokinetic interaction with trimethoprim are associated with further prolongation of the QTc interval.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected 
bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Folate Deficiency Avoid use of 
BACTRIM in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, in those with possible folate deficiency (e.g., the elderly, chronic alcoholics, patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy, patients with 
malabsorption syndrome, and patients in malnutrition states) and in those with severe allergies or bronchial asthma. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly 
patients or in patients with preexisting folic acid deficiency or kidney failure. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy (see PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ). BACTRIM: precautions: 
Hemolysis In glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals, hemolysis may occur. This reaction is frequently dose-related. Hypoglycemia Cases of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients treated
with BACTRIM are seen rarely, usually occurring after a few days of therapy. Patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition or those receiving high doses of BACTRIM are particularly at 
risk. Impaired Phenylalanine Metabolism The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM has been noted to impair phenylalanine metabolism, but this is of no significance in phenylketonuric patients on 
appropriate dietary restriction. Porphyria and Hypothyroidism Like other drugs containing sulfonamides, BACTRIM can precipitate porphyria crisis and hypothyroidism. Avoid use of BACTRIM in patients 
with porphyria or thyroid dysfunction. BACTRIM: precautions: Potential Risk in the Treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) AIDS 
patients may not tolerate or respond to BACTRIM in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of adverse reactions, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase 
(transaminase) values, with BACTRIM therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for P. jirovecii pneumonia has been reported to be increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the
use of BACTRIM in non-AIDS patients. If a patient develops skin rash, fever, leukopenia or any sign of adverse reaction, reevaluate benefit-risk of continuing therapy or re-challenge with BACTRIM (see
WARNINGS ). Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM and leucovorin during treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia (see WARNINGS ).

CONTENT: BACTRIM: teratogenic_effects: Teratogenic Effects Human Data While there are no large prospective, well controlled studies in pregnant women and their babies, some retrospective epidemiologic
studies suggest an association between first trimester exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, 
cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. These studies, however, were limited by the small number of exposed cases and the lack of adjustment for multiple 
statistical comparisons and confounders. These studies are further limited by recall, selection, and information biases, and by limited generalizability of their findings. Lastly, outcome measures 
varied between studies, limiting cross-study comparisons. Alternatively, other epidemiologic studies did not detect statistically significant associations between sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim 
exposure and specific malformations. BACTRIM: teratogenic_effects: Animal Data In rats, oral doses of either 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects 
manifested mainly as cleft palates. These doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed 
when 512 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with
doses of trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose based on body surface area.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: laboratory_tests: Laboratory Tests Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry testing should be done frequently in patients receiving BACTRIM. Perform urinalyses with careful 
microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function. Discontinue BACTRIM if a significant electrolyte abnormality, renal 
insufficiency or reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted.         
SOURCE:BACTRIM label


CONTENT: BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger 
subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate 
deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or 
without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased 
incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be 
monitored. BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage 
adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
section). The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given 
concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM 
treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Bactrim Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Bactrim DS Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.
BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher 
and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics ).

BACTRIM can increase the risk of renal failure. This information comes from the adverse reactions section of the BACTRIM label, which lists renal failure and other related renal issues as potential 
genitourinary adverse reactions. Additionally, there have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with the coadministration of BACTRIM and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients.
