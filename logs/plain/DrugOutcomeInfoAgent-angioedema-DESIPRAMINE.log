CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Available evidence suggests that many depressions have a biochemical basis in the form of a relative deficiency 
of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and serotonin. Norepinephrine deficiency may be associated with relatively low urinary 3-methoxy-4- hydroxyphenyl glycol (MHPG) levels, while serotonin 
deficiencies may be associated with low spinal fluid levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. While the precise mechanism of action of the tricyclic antidepressants is unknown, a leading theory suggests 
that they restore normal levels of neurotransmitters by blocking the re-uptake of these substances from the synapse in the central nervous system. Evidence indicates that the secondary amine tricyclic
antidepressants, including desipramine hydrochloride, may have greater activity in blocking the re-uptake of norepinephrine. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: Tertiary amine tricyclic 
antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, may have greater effect on serotonin re-uptake. Desipramine hydrochloride is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and does not act primarily as a central 
nervous system stimulant. It has been found in some studies to have a more rapid onset of action than imipramine. Earliest therapeutic effects may occasionally be seen in 2 to 5 days, but full 
treatment benefit usually requires 2 to 3 weeks to obtain. Metabolism Tricyclic antidepressants, such as desipramine hydrochloride, are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Tricyclic 
antidepressants or their metabolites are to some extent excreted through the gastric mucosa and reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Desipramine is metabolized in the liver, and approximately 
70% is excreted in the urine. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: The rate of metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants varies widely from individual to individual, chiefly on a genetically determined 
basis. Up to a 36-fold difference in plasma level may be noted among individuals taking the same oral dose of desipramine. The ratio of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the 
elderly, most likely due to decreased renal elimination with aging. Certain drugs, particularly the psychostimulants and the phenothiazines, increase plasma levels of concomitantly administered 
tricyclic antidepressants through competition for the same metabolic enzyme systems. Concurrent administration of cimetidine and tricyclic antidepressants can produce clinically significant increases 
in the plasma concentrations of the tricyclic antidepressants. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: Conversely, decreases in plasma levels of the tricyclic antidepressants have been reported upon 
discontinuation of cimetidine, which may result in the loss of the therapeutic efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant. Other substances, particularly barbiturates and alcohol, induce liver enzyme 
activity and thereby reduce tricyclic antidepressant plasma levels. Similar effects have been reported with tobacco smoke. Research on the relationship of plasma level to therapeutic response with the
tricyclic antidepressants has produced conflicting results. While some studies report no correlation, many studies cite therapeutic levels for most tricyclics in the range of 50 to 300 nanograms per 
milliliter. The therapeutic range is different for each tricyclic antidepressant. For desipramine, an optimal range of therapeutic plasma levels has not been established.

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive episode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though not 
established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar 
disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be
adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and 
depression. It should be noted that desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Serotonin Syndrome: The development of a potentially 
life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and SSRIs, including desipramine hydrochloride, alone but particularly with concomitant 
use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of 
serotonin (in particular, MAOIs both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue). Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental 
status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular 
changes (e.g. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be 
monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. The concomitant use of desipramine hydrochloride with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Desipramine hydrochloride 
should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of 
administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local 
tissue injection) or at lower doses. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a 
patient taking desipramine hydrochloride. Desipramine hydrochloride should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). If 
concomitant use of desipramine hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort is 
clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Treatment with desipramine 
hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: 
Angle-Closure Glaucoma: The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including desipramine hydrochloride may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with 
anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. General Extreme caution should be used when this drug is given in the following situations: In patients with cardiovascular disease, 
because of the possibility of conduction defects, arrhythmias, tachycardias, strokes, and acute myocardial infarction. In patients who have a family history of sudden death, cardiac dysrhythmias, or 
cardiac conduction disturbances. In patients with a history of urinary retention or glaucoma, because of the anticholinergic properties of the drug. In patients with thyroid disease or those taking 
thyroid medication, because of the possibility of cardiovascular toxicity, including arrhythmias. In patients with a history of seizure disorder, because this drug has been shown to lower the seizure 
threshold.

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: warnings: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and 
unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, 
agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients
being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms 
and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. 
DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who 
are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the 
patient's presenting symptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be
alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, 
and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for desipramine hydrochloride should be 
written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major

with a history of seizure disorder, because this drug has been shown to lower the seizure threshold. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Seizures precede cardiac dysrhythmias and death in some patients. This drug 
is capable of blocking the antihypertensive effect of guanethidine and similarly acting compounds. The patient should be cautioned that this drug may impair the mental and/or physical abilities 
required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery. In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it should be borne in mind that the potentiation 
may increase the danger inherent in any suicide attempt or overdosage. Pregnancy There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in woman exposed to antidepressants, including 
desipramine hydrochloride tablets during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or 
visiting online at http://womensmentalhealth. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: /clinical-and-research- programs/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants Safe use of desipramine hydrochloride during pregnancy and 
lactation has not been established; therefore, if it is to be given to pregnant patients, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential, the possible benefits must be weighed against the 
possible hazards to mother and child. Animal reproductive studies have been inconclusive. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desipramine hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 
aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger 
patients. Lower doses are recommended for elderly patients. ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) The ratio of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the elderly, most likely due to 
decreased renal elimination with aging. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients 
with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. 
Desipramine hydrochloride use in the elderly has been associated with a proneness to falling as well as confusional states (See ADVERSE REACTIONS .

of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and serotonin. Norepinephrine deficiency may be associated with relatively low urinary 3-methoxy-4- hydroxyphenyl glycol (MHPG) levels, while serotonin 
deficiencies may be associated with low spinal fluid levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. While the precise mechanism of action of the tricyclic antidepressants is unknown, a leading theory suggests 
that they restore normal levels of neurotransmitters by blocking the re-uptake of these substances from the synapse in the central nervous system. Evidence indicates that the secondary amine tricyclic
antidepressants, including desipramine hydrochloride, may have greater activity in blocking the re-uptake of norepinephrine. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: Tertiary amine tricyclic 
antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, may have greater effect on serotonin re-uptake. Desipramine hydrochloride is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and does not act primarily as a central 
nervous system stimulant. It has been found in some studies to have a more rapid onset of action than imipramine. Earliest therapeutic effects may occasionally be seen in 2 to 5 days, but full 
treatment benefit usually requires 2 to 3 weeks to obtain. Metabolism Tricyclic antidepressants, such as desipramine hydrochloride, are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Tricyclic 
antidepressants or their metabolites are to some extent excreted through the gastric mucosa and reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Desipramine is metabolized in the liver, and approximately 
70% is excreted in the urine. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: The rate of metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants varies widely from individual to individual, chiefly on a genetically determined 
basis. Up to a 36-fold difference in plasma level may be noted among individuals taking the same oral dose of desipramine. The ratio of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the 
elderly, most likely due to decreased renal elimination with aging. Certain drugs, particularly the psychostimulants and the phenothiazines, increase plasma levels of concomitantly administered 
tricyclic antidepressants through competition for the same metabolic enzyme systems. Concurrent administration of cimetidine and tricyclic antidepressants can produce clinically significant increases 
in the plasma concentrations of the tricyclic antidepressants. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: Conversely, decreases in plasma levels of the tricyclic antidepressants have been reported upon 
discontinuation of cimetidine, which may result in the loss of the therapeutic efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant. Other substances, particularly barbiturates and alcohol, induce liver enzyme 
activity and thereby reduce tricyclic antidepressant plasma levels. Similar effects have been reported with tobacco smoke. Research on the relationship of plasma level to therapeutic response with the
tricyclic antidepressants has produced conflicting results. While some studies report no correlation, many studies cite therapeutic levels for most tricyclics in the range of 50 to 300 nanograms per 
milliliter. The therapeutic range is different for each tricyclic antidepressant. For desipramine, an optimal range of therapeutic plasma levels has not been established.

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: boxed_warning: Suicidality and Antidepressant Drugs Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, 
adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of desipramine hydrochloride tablets or any other 
antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants 
compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are 
themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical 
worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. DESIPRAMINE: boxed_warning: Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. 
Desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in pediatric patients ( See WARNINGS: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk , PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients , and PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use .

CONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and 
risks associated with treatment with desipramine hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and other Serious 
Mental illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions" is available for desipramine hydrochloride. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to 
read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any 
questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document. Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if 
these occur while taking desipramine hydrochloride. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to 
the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in 
behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be 
advised to observe for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, 
especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and 
behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Patients should be advised that taking desipramine hydrochloride can cause mild
pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle closure glaucoma, when 
diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open- angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible
to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established ( see BOX 
WARNING and WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Therefore, desipramine hydrochloride is not recommended for use in children. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Anyone considering the use of 
desipramine hydrochloride in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need (see also ADVERSE REACTIONS- Cardiovascular ). General It is important that this drug be 
dispensed in the least possible quantities to depressed outpatients, since suicide has been accomplished with this class of drug ( see WARNINGS-Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk ). Ordinary prudence
requires that children not have access to this drug or to potent drugs of any kind; if possible, this drug should be dispensed in containers with child-resistant safety closures. Storage of this drug 
in the home must be supervised responsibly. If serious adverse effects occur, dosage should be reduced or treatment should be altered. Desipramine hydrochloride therapy in patients with 
manic-depressive illness may induce a hypomanic state after the depressive phase terminates. The drug may cause exacerbation of psychosis in schizophrenic patients. Both elevation and lowering of 
blood sugar levels have been reported. DESIPRAMINE: precautions: Leukocyte and differential counts should be performed in any patient who develops fever and sore throat during therapy; the drug should
be discontinued if there is evidence of pathologic neutrophil depression. Clinical experience in the concurrent administration of ECT and antidepressant drugs is limited. Thus, if such treatment is 
essential, the possibility of increased risk relative to benefits should be considered. This drug should be discontinued as soon as possible prior to elective surgery because of possible 
cardiovascular effects. Hypertensive episodes have been observed during surgery in patients taking desipramine hydrochloride.

risk of angioedema associated with its use. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to determine whether Desipramine increases or decreases the risk of angioedema. 

<DONE> DO-NOT-KNOW

Justification: The FDA label data, which is the source of information for this inquiry, does not mention angioedema as a side effect or a condition affected by Desipramine. Consequently, there is no 
reliable information to suggest that Desipramine has an effect on the risk of angioedema.
