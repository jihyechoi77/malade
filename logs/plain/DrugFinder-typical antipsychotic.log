        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. First, identify the generic names of the drugs from the list provided: Thiothixene, Haldol Decanoate (brand name for Haloperidol Decanoate), Haloperidol Decanoate, Haloperidol Lactate, 
Pimozide, Molindone Hydrochloride, and Haloperidol.
2. Next, look at the usage rates from the medical database query and sum the usage rates for different formulations of the same drug to find the total usage rate for each drug.
3. Haloperidol and its variants (Haloperidol Decanoate, Haloperidol Lactate, and other formulations) have the highest total usage rate. Summing up all the variants of Haloperidol, we get a total of 
39928 prescriptions.
4. Thiothixene has a total of 184 prescriptions.
5. Pimozide has a total of 2 prescriptions.
6. Molindone Hydrochloride is not listed in the database query, so its usage rate is unknown but assumed to be less than the lowest listed rate, which is 1.
7. Since Molindone Hydrochloride has an unknown usage rate and is assumed to be less than the lowest listed rate, it is not considered one of the most common.
8. The three most common drugs from the list, based on the total usage rates, are Haloperidol, Thiothixene, and Pimozide.
