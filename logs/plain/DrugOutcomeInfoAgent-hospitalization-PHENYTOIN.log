CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such 
as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry.
This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a 
pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other 
manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: The background 
risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during 
pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment
of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased 
levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before 
delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2. PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: 4-fold 
increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been 
reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental 
deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth 
retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: geriatric_use: 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age  . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required .         
SOURCE:PHENYTOIN label


CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to 
sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when 
possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin 
at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations 
may increase modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50
mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered
intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the 
slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms . Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. 
Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form 
over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt 
and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those
with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly 
patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required . 2. PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: 7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy 
because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted
as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels 
should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin 
within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: The drug should be injected
slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: drug_interactions: Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing 
neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or 
Management : Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. PHENYTOIN: drug_interactions: 
Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives,

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using 
alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of 
intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as “purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin 
injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms 
may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 
Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the 
administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile 
saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and 
abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with
renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view 
of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other 
Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other 
adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of 
fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This 
drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's 
inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above 
Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible 
cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if 
serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.

intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as “purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin 
injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms 
may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 
Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the 
administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile 
saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and 
abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with
renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view 
of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other 
Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other 
adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of 
fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This 
drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's 
inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above 
Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible 
cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if 
serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.

Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding 
preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding 
preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to 
measure serum phenytoin concentrations.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy
Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal 
hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been
reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, 
including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and 
other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy:
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an 
approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital 
hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view 
of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other 
Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ( 4 ) Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of 
trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine ) by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values. (5) Warfarin’s anticoagulant effect can be reduced in the presence of 
carbamazepine. (6) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban (direct acting oral anticoagulants) is expected to result in decreased plasma concentrations of
these anticoagulants that may be insufficient to achieve the intended therapeutic effect. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In general, coadministration of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, 
dabigatran, and edoxaban should be avoided. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary. Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine Carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules increase the plasma levels of the following agents. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of
the treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Clomipramine 
HCl, Phenytoin( 7 ), and Primidone Carbamazepine extended-release capsules can increase the concentrations of clomipramine, phenytoin, and primidone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage 
on one of these agents in this category, and then begins treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these drugs. ( 7 )Phenytoin has also been 
reported to decrease in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide is an 
inactive prodrug and is converted to its active metabolite in part by CYP3A. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide are reportedly 
increased by chronic co-administration of CYP3A4 inducers. There is a potential for increased cyclophosphamide toxicity when coadministered with carbamazepine. Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic 
Interactions with Carbamazepine: Delavirdine Coadministration of carbamazepine with delavirdine may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of 
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Lithium Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects. Thyroid 
Effects with Other Anticonvulsant Medications Alterations of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: 
Chloroquine and Mefloquine Anti-malarial drugs, such as chloroquine and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of carbamazepine. Thus if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the 
agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose adjustment may be necessary. CNS Depressants The 
concomitant use of carbamazepine extended-release capsules and other CNS depressants can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, hypotension, and syncope.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: information_for_patients: 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information
Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take 
the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin 
without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus  . EXTENDED PHENYTOIN
SODIUM: information_for_patients: Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, may increase the risk of 
suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal 
thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers  . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and 
symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician  . EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: information_for_patients: Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with 
Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and
in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence 
immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use  . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that 
cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms
to their healthcare provider  . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin sodium and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or
upper airway swelling  . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking 
their physician’s advice [ Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2 )] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, 
elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute 
hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in 
association with administration of phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. 
EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) 
including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates
the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS  . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, 
follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The 
chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia,
and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 
5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring 
of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, 
caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn 
Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes . 
Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial 
features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in 
combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: A 
potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can
be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug’s inhibitory effects on insulin 
release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the 
therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as “delirium,” “psychosis,” or “encephalopathy,” or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are
effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate and thiazides are approximately 
additive. Heart Failure Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients 
enalapril maleate improves symptoms, increases survival, and decreases the frequency of hospitalization (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of 
survival trials). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 
≤35 percent), enalapril maleate tablets, USP decreases the rate of development of overt heart failure and decreases the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart
Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of survival trials). In using enalapril maleate, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 
captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that enalapril maleate does not 
have a similar risk (see WARNINGS , Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: In considering use of enalapril maleate, it should be noted that in controlled clinical 
trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, it should be noted that black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been 
reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ).

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: drug_interactions: Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing 
neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or 
Management : Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. PHENYTOIN: drug_interactions: 
Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, 
paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, 
oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when 
given with fosamprenavir alone may PHENYTOIN: drug_interactions: decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and 
ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, 
clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels 
is unpredictable 7.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations following fosphenytoin administration.

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association 
with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene 2 . Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or 
blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify 
cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). 
Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. THIOTHIXENE: 
warnings: The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical 
monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens 
for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be 
carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Pregnancy Safe use of thiothixene during pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, this drug should be given to pregnant patients
only when, in the judgment of the physician, the expected benefits from the treatment exceed the possible risks to mother and fetus. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Non-teratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to 
antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, 
tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases 
neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Thiothixene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
Animal reproduction studies and clinical experience to date have not demonstrated any teratogenic effects. In the animal reproduction studies with thiothixene, there was some decrease in conception 
rate and litter size, and an increase in resorption rate in rats and rabbits. Similar findings have been reported with other psychotropic agents. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: After repeated oral 
administration of thiothixene to rats (5 to 15 mg/kg/day), rabbits (3 to 50 mg/kg/day), and monkeys (1 to 3 mg/kg/day) before and during gestation, no teratogenic effects were seen. Usage in Children 
The use of thiothixene in children under 12 years of age is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established. As is true with many CNS drugs, thiothixene may impair the 
mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, 
the patient should be cautioned accordingly. As in the case of other CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving thiothixene should be cautioned about the possible additive effects (which may include 
hypotension) with CNS depressants and with alcohol.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such 
as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry.
This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a 
pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other 
manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: The background 
risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during 
pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment
of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased 
levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before 
delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2. PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: 4-fold 
increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been 
reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental 
deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth 
retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

hospitalization. However, the FDA label data does not specify whether phenytoin increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. Therefore, without this specific information, I cannot provide a 
definitive answer to the question.

<DONE> DO-NOT-KNOW

The justification for this response is that the FDA label data, which is the source of information I have access to for this inquiry, does not contain details on the risk of hospitalization associated
with the use of phenytoin. Consequently, I cannot determine whether phenytoin increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization based on the available data.
