respectively, and minor embolic events 10.8% vs. 10.2%, respectively). WARFARIN: clinical_studies: Major hemorrhages occurred in 4.6% of patients in the higher intensity INR group compared to zero in 
the lower intensity INR group. 14.3 Myocardial Infarction WARIS (The Warfarin Re-Infarction Study) was a double-blind, randomized study of 1214 patients 2 to 4 weeks post-infarction treated with 
warfarin to a target INR of 2.8 to 4.8. The primary endpoint was a composite of total mortality and recurrent infarction. A secondary endpoint of cerebrovascular events was assessed. Mean follow-up of
the patients was 37 months. The results for each endpoint separately, including an analysis of vascular death, are provided in Table 7 . WARFARIN: clinical_studies: Table 7: WARIS – Endpoint Analysis

Prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or cardiac valve replacement. Reduction in the risk of death, recurrent myocardial infarction 
(MI), and thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization after myocardial infarction. Limitations of Use Warfarin sodium tablets have no direct effect on an established thrombus, nor 
does it reverse ischemic tissue damage. Once a thrombus has occurred, however, the goals of anticoagulant treatment are to prevent further extension of the formed clot and to prevent secondary 
thromboembolic complications that may result in serious and possibly fatal sequelae. WARFARIN: indications_and_usage: Warfarin sodium tablets are a vitamin K antagonist indicated for: Prophylaxis and

ANSWER: WARFARIN is indicated for the reduction in the risk of death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), and thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization after myocardial 
infarction. In the Warfarin Re-Infarction Study (WARIS), treatment with warfarin to a target INR of 2.8 to 4.8 showed a 24% risk reduction in total mortality (p = 0.030) and a 34% risk reduction in 
recurrent MI (p = 0.001) compared to placebo. The study also reported a 54% risk reduction in cerebrovascular events (p = 0.002). These results suggest that warfarin decreases the risk of mortality 
after myocardial infarction.

        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether WARFARIN increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
2. FDAHandler responded by indicating that WARFARIN is indicated for the reduction in the risk of death after myocardial infarction. In the Warfarin Re-Infarction Study (WARIS), treatment with 
warfarin showed a 24% risk reduction in total mortality compared to placebo.
3. The FDA label for WARFARIN, as provided by FDAHandler, supports the conclusion that WARFARIN decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.

WARFARIN decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. This conclusion is based on the Warfarin Re-Infarction Study (WARIS), which showed that treatment with warfarin led to a 24% risk 
reduction in total mortality compared to placebo. The FDA label for WARFARIN confirms its indication for reducing the risk of death after myocardial infarction.
