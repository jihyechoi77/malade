CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Lisinopril Hypotension - Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently 
instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with lisinopril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with lisinopril can be minimized by
either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with lisinopril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, initiate therapy with lisinopril at a 
dose of 5 mg daily, and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour. (See WARNINGS , and 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) When a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving lisinopril, an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . 
LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: ) Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) Inhibitors: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on 
diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may result in deterioration of 
renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy. The 
antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): Dual blockade of the 
RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or direct renin inhibitors (such as aliskiren) is associated with increased risk of hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal 
function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. The VA NEPHRON trial enrolled 1448 patients with type 2 diabetes, elevated urinary-albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and decreased 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR 30 to 89.9 ml/min), randomized them to lisinopril or placebo on a background of losartan therapy and followed them for a median of 2.2 years. LISINOPRIL: 
drug_interactions: Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR, end state 
renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Monitor 
blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with lisinopril and 
hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with PRINZIDE in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other Agents: Lisinopril has been used concomitantly 
with nitrates and/or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: No meaningful clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred 
when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol, digoxin, or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril. Agents Increasing Serum 
Potassium: Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, or amiloride), 
potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated, because of 
demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with
drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical studies of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether 
they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for 
an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant 
disease or other drug therapy. In a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study in elderly versus young hypertensive patients using the lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination, area under the plasma 
concentration time curve (AUC) increased approximately 120% for lisinopril and approximately 80% for hydrochlorothiazide in older patients. LISINOPRIL: geriatric_use: This drug is known to be 
substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased 
renal function, care should be taken in dose selection. Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: pharmacodynamics: Pharmacodynamics Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent
with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients. (See WARNINGS .) In 
most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril, with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six 
hours. In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy. At recommended single daily doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for 
at least 24 hours, after dosing, although the effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect six hours after dosing. The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during 
long-term therapy. LISINOPRIL: pharmacodynamics: Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood
pressure. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac 
output and in heart rate. In a study in nine hypertensive patients, following administration of lisinopril, there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant. Data from several 
small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function, but suggest that changes, if any, are not 
large. In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure (see PRECAUTIONS ).         
SOURCE:LISINOPRIL label


CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: warnings: Periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in patients with collagen vascular disease and renal disease should be considered. Hepatic Failure Rarely, ACE inhibitors 
have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice or hepatitis and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis, and (sometimes) death. The mechanism of this syndrome is not 
understood. Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow-up. 
Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease. In patients with renal disease, thiazides may precipitate azotemia. Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in 
patients with impaired renal function. Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease, since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte 
balance may precipitate hepatic coma. LISINOPRIL: warnings: Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. The possibility of exacerbation or 
activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported. Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions , Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide ). Acute 
Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma : Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms 
include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. 
The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. 
LISINOPRIL: warnings: Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy. Fetal Toxicity Use of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin
system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death. Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal 
lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations. Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, and death. When pregnancy is detected, discontinue 
lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as soon as possible. These adverse outcomes are usually associated with the use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy. LISINOPRIL: 
warnings: Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system 
from other antihypertensive agents. Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus. In the unusual case that there is no 
appropriate alternative therapy to drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system for a particular patient, apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus. Perform serial ultrasound examinations 
to assess the intra-amniotic environment. If oligohydramnios is observed, discontinue lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother. Fetal testing may 
be appropriate, based on the week of pregnancy. Patients and physicians should be aware, however, that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury. 
LISINOPRIL: warnings: Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets for hypotension, oliguria, and hyperkalemia ( See PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric
Use ). Lisinopril-Hydrochlorothiazide Teratogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats with up to 90 mg/kg/day of lisinopril in combination with 10 mg/kg/day of hydrochlorothiazide. This dose of
lisinopril is 5 times (in mice) and 10 times (in rats) the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHDD) when compared on a body surface area basis (mg/m 2 ); the dose of hydrochlorothiazide is 0.9 
times (in mice) and 1.8 times (in rats) the MRHDD. Maternal or fetotoxic effects were not seen in mice with the combination. LISINOPRIL: warnings: In rats decreased maternal weight gain and decreased 
fetal weight occurred down to 3/10 mg/kg/day (the lowest dose tested). Associated with the decreased fetal weight was a delay in fetal ossification. The decreased fetal weight and delay in fetal 
ossification were not seen in saline-supplemented animals given 90/10 mg/kg/day. No teratogenic effects of lisinopril were seen in studies of pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits. On a body surface area 
basis, the doses used were up 55 times, 33 times, and 0.15 times, respectively, the MRHDD. Hydrochlorothiazide Studies in which hydrochlorothiazide was orally administered to pregnant mice and rats 
during their respective periods of major organogenesis at doses up to 3000 and 1000 mg/kg/day, respectively, provided no evidence of harm to the fetus. These doses are more than 150 times the MRHDD on
a body surface area basis. LISINOPRIL: warnings: Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia and possibly other 
adverse reactions that have occurred in adults.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: 1 mEq/L; however, approximately 15 percent of patients had increases greater than 0.5 mEq/L and approximately six percent had a decrease greater than 0.5 
mEq/L. In the same study, patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS .) ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that 
degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated. While the mechanism through 
which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension.
LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied, Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average 
response to lisinopril monotherapy than non-Black patients. Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration of lisinopril, peak serum concentrations occur within about 7 hours. Declining
serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation. This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to 
dose. Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins. Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine. Based on urinary recovery, the mean extent
of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25 percent, with large intersubject variability (6% to 60%) at all doses tested (5 mg to 80 mg). LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Lisinopril absorption 
is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract. Upon multiple dosing, lisinopril exhibits an effective half-life of accumulation of 12 hours. Impaired renal function decreases
elimination of lisinopril, which is excreted principally through the kidneys, but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL/min. Above this 
glomerular filtration rate, the elimination half-life is little changed. With greater impairment, however, peak and trough lisinopril levels increase, time to peak concentration increases and time to 
attain steady state is prolonged. Older patients, on average, have (approximately doubled) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) than younger patients. (See 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis. Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood-brain barrier poorly. LISINOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Multiple 
doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues. However, milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14 C lisinopril. By whole body 
autoradiography, radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats, but none was found in the fetuses. Pharmacodynamics Administration of lisinopril to 
patients with hypertension results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia. Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not 
observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and/or salt-depleted patients. (See WARNINGS .) In most patients studied, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: general_precautions: General Lisinopril Aortic Stenosis/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: As with all vasodilators, lisinopril should be given with caution to patients with obstruction
in the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Impaired Renal Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in 
susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with 
unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur. LISINOPRIL: general_precautions: Experience with another angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. In such patients renal function should be monitored during the first few 
weeks of therapy. Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre-existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine, usually minor and transient, especially 
when lisinopril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic. This is more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction of lisinopril and/or discontinuation of the 
diuretic may be required. Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . ) Hyperkalemia: In clinical trials hyperkalemia 
(serum potassium greater than 5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1. LISINOPRIL: general_precautions: 4 percent of hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide. In most 
cases these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy. Hyperkalemia was not a cause of discontinuation of therapy. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal 
insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements and/or potassium-containing salt substitutes. Hyperkalemia can cause serious, sometimes 
fatal, arrhythmias. Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be used cautiously, if at all, with these agents and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug 
Interactions .) Cough: Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors, always resolving after 
discontinuation of therapy. LISINOPRIL: general_precautions: ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. Surgery/Anesthesia: In patients undergoing major 
surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension, lisinopril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release. If hypotension occurs and is considered to be 
due to this mechanism, it can be corrected by volume expansion. Hydrochlorothiazide Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at 
appropriate intervals. All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance: namely, hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, and hypokalemia. 
Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids. LISINOPRIL: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General Lisinopril 
Aortic Stenosis/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: As with all vasodilators, lisinopril should be given with caution to patients with obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle. Impaired Renal 
Function: As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe congestive heart 
failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be associated 
with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, increases in blood urea 
nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur.

ANSWER: Lisinopril can both increase and decrease the risk of renal failure depending on the patient's condition and concurrent medications. In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or with 
compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs with lisinopril may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. 
Additionally, dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors like lisinopril is associated with an increased risk of changes in renal function, including acute renal failure. 
However, in patients with severe congestive heart failure or with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, treatment with lisinopril may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia 
and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death. These effects are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. It is important to monitor renal function in patients
receiving lisinopril, especially those with pre-existing renal impairment or those on diuretic therapy.

        Question: Does LISINOPRIL increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether LISINOPRIL increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler responded that Lisinopril can both increase and decrease the risk of renal failure depending on the patient's condition and concurrent medications.
3. In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs with lisinopril may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute
renal failure, which is usually reversible.
4. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors like lisinopril is associated with an increased risk of changes in renal function, including acute renal failure.
5. However, in patients with severe congestive heart failure or with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, treatment with lisinopril may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive 
azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death, which are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy.
6. It is important to monitor renal function in patients receiving lisinopril, especially those with pre-existing renal impairment or those on diuretic therapy.
        -----
        Final answer: Lisinopril can both increase and decrease the risk of renal failure depending on various factors such as the patient's condition and concurrent medications. It can lead to 
deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure in certain populations, but may also be associated with renal benefits in specific clinical scenarios. Monitoring renal function
is crucial in patients receiving lisinopril.

Lisinopril can both increase and decrease the risk of renal failure depending on various factors such as the patient's condition and concurrent medications. It can lead to deterioration of renal 
function, including possible acute renal failure in certain populations, such as elderly patients, those who are volume-depleted, or those with compromised renal function, especially when 
co-administered with NSAIDs. Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors like lisinopril is associated with an increased risk of changes in renal function, including acute renal 
failure. However, in patients with severe congestive heart failure or with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis, treatment with lisinopril may be associated with oliguria and/or progressive 
azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death, which are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and/or diuretic therapy. It is important to monitor renal function in 
patients receiving lisinopril, especially those with pre-existing renal impairment or those on diuretic therapy.
