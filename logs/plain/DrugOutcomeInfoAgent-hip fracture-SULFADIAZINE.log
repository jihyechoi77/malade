CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Several cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in patients receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy. 1,2,3 Leukopenia associated with
silver sulfadiazine administration is primarily characterized by decreased neutrophil count. Maximal white blood cell depression occurs within two to four days of initiation of therapy. Rebound to 
normal leukocyte levels follows onset within two to three days. Recovery is not influenced by continuation of silver sulfadiazine therapy. An increased incidence has been seen in patients treated 
concurrently with cimetidine. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiforme, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial nephritis. Reduction in 
bacterial growth after application of topical antibacterial agents has been reported to permit spontaneous healing of deep partial-thickness burns by preventing conversion of the partial thickness to 
full thickness by sepsis. SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: However, reduction in bacterial colonization has caused delayed separation, in some cases necessitating escharotomy in order to prevent 
contracture.

CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category B. A reproductive study has been performed in rabbits at doses up to three to ten times the concentration of silver
sulfadiazine in silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% and has revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to silver sulfadiazine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant 
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly justified, especially in pregnant women approaching or
at term. SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: (See CONTRAINDICATIONS )

cream, USP 1% at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of approximately one sixteenth of an inch. Whenever necessary, the cream should be reapplied to any areas 
from which it has been removed by patient activity. Administration may be accomplished in minimal time because dressings are not required. However, if individual patient requirements make dressings 
necessary, they may be used. Reapply immediately after hydrotherapy. Treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should be continued until satisfactory healing has occurred or until the burn site
is ready for grafting. SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: The drug should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except if a significant

The question asked was whether SULFADIAZINE increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. I attempted to consult FDAHandler to inquire about the effects of SULFADIAZINE on the risk of hip fracture.
However, FDAHandler did not provide an answer to the question. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, I do not have the information to determine the effect of SULFADIAZINE on the risk of 
hip fracture.
