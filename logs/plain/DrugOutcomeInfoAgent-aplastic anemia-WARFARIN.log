consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin. Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin. 7.5 Botanical (Herbal) 
Products and Foods More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals. Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or 
pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may 
vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g. WARFARIN: 
drug_interactions: garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of 
warfarin sodium. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium (e.g., co-enzyme Q 10 , St. John’s wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with warfarin sodium 
through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John’s wort). The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium. Advise patients taking 
warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large 
amounts of green leafy vegetables.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue necrosis: Necrosis or gangrene of skin or other tissues can occur, with severe cases requiring debridement or amputation. 
Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulants if necessary. ( 5.2 ) Calciphylaxis: Fatal and serious cases have occurred. Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative 
anticoagulation therapy. ( 5.3 ) Acute kidney injury may occur during episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. ( 5.4 ) Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli: Some cases have 
progressed to necrosis or death. Discontinue warfarin sodium if such emboli occur. ( 5.5 ) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Initial therapy with warfarin sodium in HIT has resulted in cases of 
amputation and death. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Warfarin sodium may be considered after platelet count has normalized. ( 5.6 ) Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves: Warfarin sodium may 
cause fetal harm; however, the benefits may outweigh the risks. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk 
factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, 
cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors  , certain concomitant drugs  , and long duration of warfarin therapy. Perform regular monitoring of INR 
in all treated patients. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration 
of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding. Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR 
levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs  . Instruct 
patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding  . 5.2 Tissue Necrosis Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other
tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (<0.1%). WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin
sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported. Careful clinical evaluation is required to 
determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin 
sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.3 Calciphylaxis Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium 
uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat 
calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. 5.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of 
thromboembolism, and for whom the benefits of warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks  . Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a 
pattern of congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Because these data were not collected in adequate and well-controlled studies, this incidence of major birth defects is not an 
adequate basis for comparison to the estimated incidences in the control group or the U.S. general population and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. Consider the benefits and risks 
of warfarin sodium and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing warfarin sodium to a pregnant woman. WARFARIN: pregnancy: Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother
or the use of medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk 
of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions In humans, warfarin 
crosses the placenta, and concentrations in fetal plasma approach the maternal values. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in 
about 5% of exposed offspring. Warfarin embryopathy is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata) and growth retardation (including low birth 
weight). WARFARIN: pregnancy: Central nervous system and eye abnormalities have also been reported, including dorsal midline dysplasia characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker 
malformation, midline cerebellar atrophy, and ventral midline dysplasia characterized by optic atrophy. Mental retardation, blindness, schizencephaly, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and other adverse 
pregnancy outcomes have been reported following warfarin exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy  .

CONTENT: WARFARIN: information_for_patients: 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Instructions for Patients Advise 
patients to: Strictly adhere to the prescribed dosage schedule  . If the prescribed dose of warfarin sodium is missed, take the dose as soon as possible on the same day but do not take a double dose 
of warfarin sodium the next day to make up for missed doses  . Obtain prothrombin time tests and make regular visits to their physician or clinic to monitor therapy  . Be aware that if therapy with 
warfarin sodium is discontinued, the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium may persist for about 2 to 5 days  . WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Avoid any activity or sport that may result in 
traumatic injury  . And to tell their physician if they fall often as this may increase their risk for complications. Eat a normal, balanced diet to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K. Avoid 
drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of leafy, green vegetables  . Contact their physician to report any serious illness, such as severe diarrhea, infection, or fever  . 
Immediately contact their physician when experiencing pain and discoloration of the skin (a purple bruise like rash) mostly on areas of the body with a high fat content, such as breasts, thighs, 
buttocks, hips and abdomen [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Immediately contact their physician when experiencing any unusual symptom or pain since 
warfarin sodium may cause small cholesterol or athero emboli. On feet it may appear as a sudden cool, painful, purple discoloration of toe(s) or forefoot [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. 
Immediately contact their physician when taking warfarin sodium after any heparin formulation therapy and experiencing bloody or black stools or appearence of bruises, or bleeding [ see Warnings and 
Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. To tell all of their healthcare professionals and dentists that they are taking warfarin sodium. This should be done before they have any surgery or dental procedure [ see 
Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ]. Carry identification stating that they are taking warfarin sodium. Bleeding Risks Advise patients to: Notify their physician immediately if any unusual bleeding or
symptoms occur. WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Signs and symptoms of bleeding include: pain, swelling or discomfort, prolonged bleeding from cuts, increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding, 
nosebleeds, bleeding of gums from brushing, unusual bleeding or bruising, red or dark brown urine, red or tar black stools, headache, dizziness, or weakness  . Concomitant Medications and Botanicals 
(Herbals) Advise patients to: Not take or discontinue any other drug, including salicylates (e.g., aspirin and topical analgesics), other over-the-counter drugs, and botanical (herbal) products except
on advice of your physician  . Pregnancy and Nursing Advise patients to: Notify their physician if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or considering breast feeding [ see Use in Specific 
Populations ( 8.1 , 8.2 , 8.

warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large 
amounts of green leafy vegetables.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue necrosis: Necrosis or gangrene of skin or other tissues can occur, with severe cases requiring debridement or amputation. 
Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulants if necessary. ( 5.2 ) Calciphylaxis: Fatal and serious cases have occurred. Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative 
anticoagulation therapy. ( 5.3 ) Acute kidney injury may occur during episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. ( 5.4 ) Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli: Some cases have 
progressed to necrosis or death. Discontinue warfarin sodium if such emboli occur. ( 5.5 ) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Initial therapy with warfarin sodium in HIT has resulted in cases of 
amputation and death. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Warfarin sodium may be considered after platelet count has normalized. ( 5.6 ) Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves: Warfarin sodium may 
cause fetal harm; however, the benefits may outweigh the risks. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk 
factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, 
cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors  , certain concomitant drugs  , and long duration of warfarin therapy. Perform regular monitoring of INR 
in all treated patients. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration 
of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding. Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR 
levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs  . Instruct 
patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding  . 5.2 Tissue Necrosis Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other
tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (<0.1%). WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin
sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported. Careful clinical evaluation is required to 
determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin 
sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.3 Calciphylaxis Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium 
uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat 
calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. 5.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of 
thromboembolism, and for whom the benefits of warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks  . Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a 
pattern of congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Because these data were not collected in adequate and well-controlled studies, this incidence of major birth defects is not an 
adequate basis for comparison to the estimated incidences in the control group or the U.S. general population and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. Consider the benefits and risks 
of warfarin sodium and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing warfarin sodium to a pregnant woman. WARFARIN: pregnancy: Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother
or the use of medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk 
of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions In humans, warfarin 
crosses the placenta, and concentrations in fetal plasma approach the maternal values. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in 
about 5% of exposed offspring. Warfarin embryopathy is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata) and growth retardation (including low birth 
weight). WARFARIN: pregnancy: Central nervous system and eye abnormalities have also been reported, including dorsal midline dysplasia characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker 
malformation, midline cerebellar atrophy, and ventral midline dysplasia characterized by optic atrophy. Mental retardation, blindness, schizencephaly, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and other adverse 
pregnancy outcomes have been reported following warfarin exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy  .

CONTENT: WARFARIN: information_for_patients: 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Instructions for Patients Advise 
patients to: Strictly adhere to the prescribed dosage schedule  . If the prescribed dose of warfarin sodium is missed, take the dose as soon as possible on the same day but do not take a double dose 
of warfarin sodium the next day to make up for missed doses  . Obtain prothrombin time tests and make regular visits to their physician or clinic to monitor therapy  . Be aware that if therapy with 
warfarin sodium is discontinued, the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium may persist for about 2 to 5 days  . WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Avoid any activity or sport that may result in 
traumatic injury  . And to tell their physician if they fall often as this may increase their risk for complications. Eat a normal, balanced diet to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K. Avoid 
drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of leafy, green vegetables  . Contact their physician to report any serious illness, such as severe diarrhea, infection, or fever  . 
Immediately contact their physician when experiencing pain and discoloration of the skin (a purple bruise like rash) mostly on areas of the body with a high fat content, such as breasts, thighs, 
buttocks, hips and abdomen [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Immediately contact their physician when experiencing any unusual symptom or pain since 
warfarin sodium may cause small cholesterol or athero emboli. On feet it may appear as a sudden cool, painful, purple discoloration of toe(s) or forefoot [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. 
Immediately contact their physician when taking warfarin sodium after any heparin formulation therapy and experiencing bloody or black stools or appearence of bruises, or bleeding [ see Warnings and 
Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. To tell all of their healthcare professionals and dentists that they are taking warfarin sodium. This should be done before they have any surgery or dental procedure [ see 
Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ]. Carry identification stating that they are taking warfarin sodium. Bleeding Risks Advise patients to: Notify their physician immediately if any unusual bleeding or
symptoms occur. WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Signs and symptoms of bleeding include: pain, swelling or discomfort, prolonged bleeding from cuts, increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding, 
nosebleeds, bleeding of gums from brushing, unusual bleeding or bruising, red or dark brown urine, red or tar black stools, headache, dizziness, or weakness  . Concomitant Medications and Botanicals 
(Herbals) Advise patients to: Not take or discontinue any other drug, including salicylates (e.g., aspirin and topical analgesics), other over-the-counter drugs, and botanical (herbal) products except
on advice of your physician  . Pregnancy and Nursing Advise patients to: Notify their physician if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or considering breast feeding [ see Use in Specific

CONTENT: WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: 2 Lactation Risk Summary Warfarin was not present in human milk from mothers treated with warfarin from a limited published study. Because of the 
potential for serious adverse reactions, including bleeding in a breastfed infant, consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother’s clinical need for warfarin 
sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from warfarin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition before prescribing warfarin sodium to a lactating woman. Clinical 
Considerations Monitor breastfeeding infants for bruising or bleeding. Data Human Data Based on published data in 15 nursing mothers, warfarin was not detected in human milk. Among the 15 full-term 
newborns, 6 nursing infants had documented prothrombin times within the expected range. Prothrombin times were not obtained for the other 9 nursing infants. Effects in premature infants have not been 
evaluated. 8. WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm  . Verify the pregnancy status of females of 
reproductive potential prior to initiating warfarin sodium therapy. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 
month after the final dose of warfarin sodium. 8.4 Pediatric Use Adequate and well-controlled studies with warfarin sodium have not been conducted in any pediatric population, and the optimum dosing, 
safety, and efficacy in pediatric patients is unknown. Pediatric use of warfarin sodium is based on adult data and recommendations, and available limited pediatric data from observational studies and 
patient registries. Pediatric patients administered warfarin sodium should avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury. WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: The developing 
hemostatic system in infants and children results in a changing physiology of thrombosis and response to anticoagulants. Dosing of warfarin in the pediatric population varies by patient age, with 
infants generally having the highest, and adolescents having the lowest milligram per kilogram dose requirements to maintain target INRs. Because of changing warfarin requirements due to age, 
concomitant medications, diet, and existing medical condition, target INR ranges may be difficult to achieve and maintain in pediatric patients, and more frequent INR determinations are recommended. 
Bleeding rates varied by patient population and clinical care center in pediatric observational studies and patient registries. Infants and children receiving vitamin K-supplemented nutrition, 
including infant formulas, may be resistant to warfarin therapy, while human milk-fed infants may be sensitive to warfarin therapy. 8. WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: 5 Geriatric Use Of the 
total number of patients receiving warfarin sodium in controlled clinical trials for which data were available for analysis, 1885 patients (24.4%) were 65 years and older, while 185 patients (2.4%) 
were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled 
out. Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin  . Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in any unsupervised patient with 
senility. Conduct more frequent monitoring for bleeding with administration of warfarin sodium to elderly patients in any situation or with any physical condition where added risk of hemorrhage is 
present. WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: Consider lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin sodium in elderly patients  . 8.6 Renal Impairment Renal clearance is considered to be a 
minor determinant of anticoagulant response to warfarin. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. Instruct patients with renal impairment taking warfarin to monitor their 
INR more frequently  . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment can potentiate the response to warfarin through impaired synthesis of clotting factors and decreased metabolism of warfarin. Conduct 
more frequent monitoring for bleeding when using warfarin sodium in these patients.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: drug_interactions: 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, antibiotics, antifungals, botanical (herbal) products, and inhibitors and inducers of 
CYP2C9, 1A2, or 3A4. ( 7 ) Consult labeling of all concurrently used drugs for complete information about interactions with warfarin sodium or increased risks for bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 General 
Information Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired
hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic 
mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: It is important to note that some
drugs may interact by more than one mechanism. More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, 
including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [ see Boxed Warning ]. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information 
about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding. 7.2 CYP450 Interactions CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 
1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 
3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin. Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease
INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin. Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2 ; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. 
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, 
stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer. Table 2: Examples of

antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin. Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic 
or antifungal in patients taking warfarin. 7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals. Few adequate, 
well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with 
botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. Some botanicals 
may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: information_for_patients: 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Instructions for Patients Advise 
patients to: Strictly adhere to the prescribed dosage schedule  . If the prescribed dose of warfarin sodium is missed, take the dose as soon as possible on the same day but do not take a double dose 
of warfarin sodium the next day to make up for missed doses  . Obtain prothrombin time tests and make regular visits to their physician or clinic to monitor therapy  . Be aware that if therapy with 
warfarin sodium is discontinued, the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium may persist for about 2 to 5 days  . WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Avoid any activity or sport that may result in 
traumatic injury  . And to tell their physician if they fall often as this may increase their risk for complications. Eat a normal, balanced diet to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K. Avoid 
drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of leafy, green vegetables  . Contact their physician to report any serious illness, such as severe diarrhea, infection, or fever  . 
Immediately contact their physician when experiencing pain and discoloration of the skin (a purple bruise like rash) mostly on areas of the body with a high fat content, such as breasts, thighs, 
buttocks, hips and abdomen [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Immediately contact their physician when experiencing any unusual symptom or pain since 
warfarin sodium may cause small cholesterol or athero emboli. On feet it may appear as a sudden cool, painful, purple discoloration of toe(s) or forefoot [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. 
Immediately contact their physician when taking warfarin sodium after any heparin formulation therapy and experiencing bloody or black stools or appearence of bruises, or bleeding [ see Warnings and 
Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. To tell all of their healthcare professionals and dentists that they are taking warfarin sodium. This should be done before they have any surgery or dental procedure [ see 
Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ]. Carry identification stating that they are taking warfarin sodium. Bleeding Risks Advise patients to: Notify their physician immediately if any unusual bleeding or
symptoms occur. WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Signs and symptoms of bleeding include: pain, swelling or discomfort, prolonged bleeding from cuts, increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding, 
nosebleeds, bleeding of gums from brushing, unusual bleeding or bruising, red or dark brown urine, red or tar black stools, headache, dizziness, or weakness  . Concomitant Medications and Botanicals 
(Herbals) Advise patients to: Not take or discontinue any other drug, including salicylates (e.g., aspirin and topical analgesics), other over-the-counter drugs, and botanical (herbal) products except

CONTENT: WARFARIN: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of 
thromboembolism, and for whom the benefits of warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks  . Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a 
pattern of congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Because these data were not collected in adequate and well-controlled studies, this incidence of major birth defects is not an 
adequate basis for comparison to the estimated incidences in the control group or the U.S. general population and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. Consider the benefits and risks 
of warfarin sodium and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing warfarin sodium to a pregnant woman. WARFARIN: pregnancy: Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother
or the use of medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk 
of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions In humans, warfarin 
crosses the placenta, and concentrations in fetal plasma approach the maternal values. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in 
about 5% of exposed offspring. Warfarin embryopathy is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata) and growth retardation (including low birth 
weight). WARFARIN: pregnancy: Central nervous system and eye abnormalities have also been reported, including dorsal midline dysplasia characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker 
malformation, midline cerebellar atrophy, and ventral midline dysplasia characterized by optic atrophy. Mental retardation, blindness, schizencephaly, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and other adverse 
pregnancy outcomes have been reported following warfarin exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy  .

CONTENT: WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Tissue necrosis: Necrosis or gangrene of skin or other tissues can occur, with severe cases requiring debridement or amputation. 
Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulants if necessary. ( 5.2 ) Calciphylaxis: Fatal and serious cases have occurred. Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative 
anticoagulation therapy. ( 5.3 ) Acute kidney injury may occur during episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. ( 5.4 ) Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli: Some cases have 
progressed to necrosis or death. Discontinue warfarin sodium if such emboli occur. ( 5.5 ) Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Initial therapy with warfarin sodium in HIT has resulted in cases of 
amputation and death. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Warfarin sodium may be considered after platelet count has normalized. ( 5.6 ) Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves: Warfarin sodium may 
cause fetal harm; however, the benefits may outweigh the risks. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Hemorrhage Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk 
factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, 
cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors  , certain concomitant drugs  , and long duration of warfarin therapy. Perform regular monitoring of INR 
in all treated patients. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration 
of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding. Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR 
levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs  . Instruct 
patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding  . 5.2 Tissue Necrosis Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other
tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (<0.1%). WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin
sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported. Careful clinical evaluation is required to 
determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin 
sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.3 Calciphylaxis Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium 
uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat 
calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. 5.

significantly reduced the risk of systemic thromboembolism including stroke (see Table 4 ). The risk reduction ranged from 60% to 86% in all except one trial (CAFA: 45%), which was stopped early due 
to published positive results from two of these trials. The incidence of major bleeding in these trials ranged from 0.6% to 2.7% (see Table 4 ). Table 4: Clinical Studies of Warfarin in Non-Rheumatic

warfarin sodium  . 14.2 Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves In a prospective, randomized, open-label, positive-controlled study in 254 patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves, the 
thromboembolic-free interval was found to be significantly greater in patients treated with warfarin alone compared with dipyridamole/aspirin-treated patients (p < 0.005) and 
pentoxifylline/aspirin-treated patients (p < 0.05). The results of this study are presented in Table 5 .

CONTENT: WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications An INR of greater than 4 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in 
most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE) Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR 
range, 2 to 3) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows: For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment 
with warfarin for 3 months is recommended. For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit
ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. 
For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient. Atrial Fibrillation In patients with 
non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2 to 3). In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at high risk of stroke (i.e., having any of the
following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, or 2 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left 
ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: In 
patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at an intermediate risk of ischemic stroke (i.e., having 1 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or 
severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. For patients with AF 
and mitral stenosis, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended; the target INR 
may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves For patients with a 
bileaflet mechanical valve or a Medtronic Hall (Minneapolis, MN) tilting disk valve in the aortic position who are in sinus rhythm and without left atrial enlargement, therapy with warfarin to a 
target INR of 2.5 (range, 2 to 3) is recommended. For patients with tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3 (range, 2.5 
to 3.5) is recommended. For patients with caged ball or caged disk valves, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) is recommended. For patients with a bioprosthetic valve in the
mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 5 (range, 2 to 3) for the first 3 months after valve insertion is recommended. If additional risk 
factors for thromboembolism are present (AF, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction), a target INR of 2.5 (range 2 to 3) is recommended. Post-Myocardial Infarction For high-risk 
patients with MI (e.g., those with a large anterior MI, those with significant heart failure, those with intracardiac thrombus visible on transthoracic echocardiography, those with AF, and those with 
a history of a thromboembolic event), therapy with combined moderate-intensity (INR, 2 to 3) warfarin plus low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/day) for at least 3 months after the MI is recommended.

decreases the risk of aplastic anemia, to which the response was DO-NOT-KNOW in both cases. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to determine if WARFARIN has any effect
on the risk of developing aplastic anemia.
