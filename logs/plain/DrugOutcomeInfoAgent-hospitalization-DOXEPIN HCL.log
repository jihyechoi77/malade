CONTENT: DOXEPIN HCL: indications_and_usage: Doxepin Hydrochloride Capsules, USP are recommended for the treatment of: Psychoneurotic patients with depression and/or anxiety. Depression and/or anxiety
associated with alcoholism (not to be taken concomitantly with alcohol). Depression and/or anxiety associated with organic disease (the possibility of drug interaction should be considered if the 
patient is receiving other drugs concomitantly). Psychotic depressive disorders with associated anxiety including involutional depression and manic-depressive disorders. The target symptoms of 
psychoneurosis that respond particularly well to doxepin hydrochloride capsules include anxiety, tension, depression, somatic symptoms and concerns, sleep disturbances, guilt, lack of energy, fear, 
apprehension and worry. Clinical experience has shown that doxepin hydrochloride capsules is safe and well tolerated even in the elderly patient. DOXEPIN HCL: indications_and_usage: Owing to lack of 
clinical experience in the pediatric population, doxepin is not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age.         
SOURCE:DOXEPIN HCL label


CONTENT: DOXEPIN HCL: clinical_pharmacology: The mechanism of action of doxepin is not definitely known. It is not a central nervous system stimulant nor a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. The current 
hypothesis is that the clinical effects are due, at least in part, to influences on the adrenergic activity at the synapses so that deactivation of norepinephrine by reuptake into the nerve terminals 
is prevented. Animal studies suggest that doxepin HCl does not appreciably antagonize the antihypertensive action of guanethidine. In animal studies anticholinergic, antiserotonin and antihistamine 
effects on smooth muscle have been demonstrated. At higher than usual clinical doses, norepinephrine response was potentiated in animals. This effect was not demonstrated in humans. DOXEPIN HCL: 
clinical_pharmacology: At clinical dosages up to 150 mg per day, doxepin can be given to man concomitantly with guanethidine and related compounds without blocking the antihypertensive effect. At 
dosages above 150 mg per day blocking of the antihypertensive effect of these compounds has been reported. Doxepin is virtually devoid of euphoria as a side effect. Characteristic of this type of 
compound, doxepin has not been demonstrated to produce the physical tolerance or psychological dependence associated with addictive compounds.         
SOURCE:DOXEPIN HCL label


CONTENT: DOXEPIN HCL: contraindications: Doxepin is contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug. Possibility of cross sensitivity with other dibenzoxepines should be 
kept in mind. Doxepin is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma or a tendency to urinary retention. These disorders should be ruled out, particularly in older patients.

ANSWER: Doxepin hydrochloride (HCL) is a dibenzoxepin tricyclic compound used as a psychotherapeutic agent. It is available in various dosages for oral administration, including 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 
75 mg, and 100 mg capsules. The medication is indicated for the treatment of psychoneurotic patients with depression and/or anxiety, depression and/or anxiety associated with alcoholism (not to be 
taken with alcohol), and depression and/or anxiety associated with organic disease. It is also used for psychotic depressive disorders with associated anxiety, including involutional depression and 
manic-depressive disorders. Doxepin HCL is considered safe and well-tolerated, even in elderly patients, but is not recommended for children under 12 years of age due to a lack of clinical experience.
The mechanism of action is believed to be related to preventing the reuptake of norepinephrine into nerve terminals, thus affecting adrenergic activity at synapses. Doxepin HCL is contraindicated in 
individuals with hypersensitivity to the drug, those with glaucoma, or a tendency to urinary retention.

risk of hospitalization associated with Doxepin HCL. The label details the indications for use, dosages, safety, tolerability, contraindications, and the mechanism of action, but it does not mention 
hospitalization as a risk or outcome related to the use of Doxepin HCL.

Given that the FDA label does not specify information about the risk of hospitalization due to Doxepin HCL, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Doxepin HCL increases or 
decreases the risk of hospitalization. The absence of this information in the label suggests that there may not be a well-established or recognized effect of Doxepin HCL on hospitalization risk that 
is acknowledged by the FDA.

Therefore, my final answer must be DO-NOT-KNOW, as the FDA label data does not specify the answer to the question regarding the risk of hospitalization with Doxepin HCL use.

        Do one of the following:

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.
            DO NOT REPEAT your original message; ONLY specify the 
            `intended_recipient` via this tool/function-call.
        2. If you are ready to have the critic check your answer,
            do so with the `final_answer` tool/function, as I have requested.
        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
        else to say, you MUST EXIT IMMEDIATELY by stating that you are done
        with the usual code (as in #3).

The question asked was whether DOXEPIN HCL increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. After consulting with FDAHandler, the information provided did not mention hospitalization as a risk or 
outcome related to the use of DOXEPIN HCL. Therefore, there is no available FDA label data to determine the effect of DOXEPIN HCL on the risk of hospitalization, and my final answer is DO-NOT-KNOW.
