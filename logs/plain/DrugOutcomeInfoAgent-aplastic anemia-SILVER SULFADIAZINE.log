CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is a topical antimicrobial drug indicated as an adjunct for the prevention and treatment of
wound sepsis in patients with second and third degree burns.         
SOURCE:SILVER SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: warnings: WARNINGS Absorption of silver sulfadiazine varies depending upon the percent of body surface area and the extent of the tissue damage. Although few have been 
reported, it is possible that any adverse reaction associated with sulfonamides may occur. Some of the reactions which have been associated with sulfonamides are as follows: blood dyscrasias including
agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hemolytic anemia; dermatologic and allergic reactions, including life-threatening cutaneous reactions [Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and exfoliative dermatitis]; gastrointestinal reactions, hepatitis and hepatocellular necrosis; CNS reactions; and toxic nephrosis. There is a potential 
cross-sensitivity between silver sulfadiazine and other sulfonamides. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: warnings: If allergic reactions attributable to treatment with silver sulfadiazine occur, continuation of 
therapy must be weighed against the potential hazards of the particular allergic reaction. Fungal proliferation in and below the eschar may occur. However, the incidence of clinically reported fungal 
superinfection is low. The use of silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% in some cases of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient individuals may be hazardous, as hemolysis may occur.         
SOURCE:SILVER SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prompt institution of appropriate regimens for care of the burned patient is of prime importance and includes the 
control of shock and pain. The burn wounds are then cleansed and debrided; silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is then applied under sterile conditions. The burn areas should be covered with silver 
sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of approximately one sixteenth of an inch. Whenever necessary, the cream should be reapplied to 
any areas from which it has been removed by patient activity. Administration may be accomplished in minimal time because dressings are not required. However, if individual patient requirements make 
dressings necessary, they may be used. Reapply immediately after hydrotherapy. Treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should be continued until satisfactory healing has occurred or until the
burn site is ready for grafting. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: The drug should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except 
if a significant adverse reaction occurs.

CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category B. A reproductive study has been performed in rabbits at doses up to three to ten times the concentration of
silver sulfadiazine in silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% and has revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to silver sulfadiazine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in 
pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly justified, especially in pregnant women 
approaching or at term. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: (See CONTRAINDICATIONS )

CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to silver sulfadiazine or any of the other 
ingredients in the preparation. Because sulfonamide therapy is known to increase the possibility of kernicterus, silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should not be used on pregnant women approaching or 
at term, on premature infants, or on newborn infants during the first 2 months of life.

CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: description: DESCRIPTION Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is a soft, white, water dispersible cream containing the antimicrobial agent silver sulfadiazine in micronized 
form for topical application. Each gram of silver sulfadiazine cream contains 10mg of micronized silver sulfadiazine. This active agent has the following structural formula: Silver sulfadiazine cream 
contains 1% w/w silver sulfadiazine. The vehicle in which the active ingredient is dispersed consists of water, stearyl alcohol, white petrolatum, polyoxyl 40 stearate, propylene glycol, isopropyl 
myristate, and sorbitan monooleate with 0.3% methylparaben as a preservative.

CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Silver sulfadiazine has broad antimicrobial activity. It is bactericidal for many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as
well as being effective against yeast. Results from in vitro testing are listed below. Sufficient data have been obtained to demonstrate that silver sulfadiazine will inhibit bacteria that are 
resistant to other antimicrobial agents and that the compound is superior to sulfadiazine. Studies utilizing radioactive micronized silver sulfadiazine, electron microscopy, and biochemical techniques
have revealed that the mechanism of action of silver sulfadiazine on bacteria differs from silver nitrate and sodium sulfadiazine. Silver sulfadiazine acts only on the cell membrane and cell wall to 
produce its bactericidal effect. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: clinical_pharmacology: Results of in Vitro Testing With Silver Sulfadiazine Cream, USP 1% Concentration of Silver Sulfadiazine Number of Sensitive

CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Several cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in patients receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy. 1,2,3 Leukopenia 
associated with silver sulfadiazine administration is primarily characterized by decreased neutrophil count. Maximal white blood cell depression occurs within two to four days of initiation of 
therapy. Rebound to normal leukocyte levels follows onset within two to three days. Recovery is not influenced by continuation of silver sulfadiazine therapy. An increased incidence has been seen in 
patients treated concurrently with cimetidine. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiforme, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial 
nephritis. Reduction in bacterial growth after application of topical antibacterial agents has been reported to permit spontaneous healing of deep partial-thickness burns by preventing conversion of 
the partial thickness to full thickness by sepsis. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: However, reduction in bacterial colonization has caused delayed separation, in some cases necessitating 
escharotomy in order to prevent contracture.

The question was whether SILVER SULFADIAZINE increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, SILVER SULFADIAZINE, like other sulfonamides, has been
associated with blood dyscrasias, including aplastic anemia. However, the FDA label does not specify the frequency of such adverse reactions. Therefore, SILVER SULFADIAZINE has been associated with an
increased risk of aplastic anemia, but the degree of risk or frequency is not detailed in the FDA label information provided.
