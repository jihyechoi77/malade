CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: spl_unclassified_section: Rx only To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ery-Ped and other antibacterial drugs, 
Ery-Ped should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria.         
SOURCE:ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE label


CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: General Prescribing Ery-Ped in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to 
provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally excreted by the liver, caution should be exercised when 
erythromycin is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and WARNINGS sections.) Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of 
myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving erythromycin therapy. There have been reports of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) occurring in infants following erythromycin 
therapy. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: In one cohort of 157 newborns who were given erythromycin for pertussis prophylaxis, seven neonates (5%) developed symptoms of non-bilious 
vomiting or irritability with feeding and were subsequently diagnosed as having IHPS requiring surgical pyloromyotomy . A possible dose-response effect was described with an absolute risk of IHPS of 
5.1% for infants who took erythromycin for 8-14 days and 10% for infants who took erythromycin for 15-21 days. 2 Since erythromycin may be used in the treatment of conditions in infants which are 
associated with significant mortality or morbidity (such as pertussis or neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis infections), the benefit of erythromycin therapy needs to be weighed against the potential risk 
of developing IHPS. Parents should be informed to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: Prolonged or repeated use 
of erythromycin may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria or fungi. If superinfection occurs, erythromycin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. When indicated, 
incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Observational studies in humans have reported cardiovascular malformations after exposure
to drug products containing erythromycin during early pregnancy. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing Ery-Ped in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected 
bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally

pregnancy. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ery-Ped should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g.,
the common cold). When Ery-Ped is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be 
taken exactly as directed.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Theophylline Erythromycin use in patients who are receiving high doses of theophylline may be associated with an increase in 
serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of theophylline should be reduced while the patient 
is receiving concomitant erythromycin therapy. There have been published reports suggesting that when oral erythromycin is given concurrently with theophylline there is a decrease in erythromycin 
serum concentrations of approximately 35%. The mechanism by which this interaction occurs is unknown. The decrease in erythromycin concentrations due to co-administration of theophylline could result 
in subtherapeutic concentrations of erythromycin. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent
verapamil, belonging to the calcium channel blockers drug class. Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels. There have been 
reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly. Increased anticoagulation effects due to interactions of erythromycin with various oral 
anticoagulants may be more pronounced in the elderly. Erythromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of the 3A isoform subfamily of the cytochrome p450 enzyme system (CYP3A). ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: 
drug_interactions: Coadministration of erythromycin and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both the 
therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored 
closely in patients concurrently receiving erythromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A
isoform are also possible. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products in post-marketing experience: 
Ergotamine/dihydroergotamine Post-marketing reports indicate that co-administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by 
vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including the central nervous system. Concomitant administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated 
(see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as triazolam and alprazolam) and Related Benzodiazepines Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, 
and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Erythromycin has been reported to increase 
concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g., lovastatin and simvastatin). Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Sildenafil (Viagra) 
Erythromycin has been reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of sildenafil. Reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert.) There have been spontaneous or 
published reports of CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, vinblastine,
and bromocriptine. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: Concomitant administration of erythromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated. (See 
CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. 
Erythromycin has been reported to significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse
events, including electrocardiographic QT/QT c interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other ventricular arrhythmias have been observed. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, 
deaths have been reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin.
