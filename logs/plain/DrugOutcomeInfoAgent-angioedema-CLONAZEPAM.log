CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: While these findings are noteworthy, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) data collected in these trials revealed a larger decline in HAM-D scores in the 
clonazepam group than the placebo group suggesting that clonazepam-treated patients were not experiencing a worsening or emergence of clinical depression. Other Adverse Events Observed During the 
Premarketing Evaluation of Clonazepam Tablets in Panic Disorder: Following is a list of modified CIGY terms that reflect treatment-emergent adverse events reported by patients treated with clonazepam 
tablets at multiple doses during clinical trials. All reported events are included except those already listed in Table 3 or elsewhere in labeling, those events for which a drug cause was remote, 
those event terms which were so general as to be uninformative, and events reported only once and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening. CLONAZEPAM: 
adverse_reactions: It is important to emphasize that, although the events occurred during treatment with clonazepam tablets, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by 
body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency. These adverse events were reported infrequently, which is defined as occurring in 1/100 to 1/1000 patients. CLONAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: Body

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: Other Cardiovascular Agents Enalapril maleate has been used concomitantly with beta adrenergic-blocking agents, methyldopa, nitrates, calcium-blocking 
agents, hydralazine, prazosin and digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Enalapril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type
diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum 
potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. 
Potassium-sparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure receiving enalapril maleate. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: Lithium Lithium toxicity has been reported in 
patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. A few cases of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant 
enalapril maleate and lithium and were reversible upon discontinuation of both drugs. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if enalapril is administered concomitantly 
with lithium. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium 
aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including enalapril maleate. mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) Inhibitors Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR 
inhibitor (e.g. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ).         
SOURCE:ENALAPRIL MALEATE label


CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: warnings: WARNINGS General Lisinopril Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions: Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of 
eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets) may be subject to a variety of adverse 
reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported rarely in patients treated with angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. This may occur at any time during treatment. ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in non-Black 
patients. LISINOPRIL: warnings: In such cases lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and 
sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. Even in those instances where swelling of only the tongue is involved, without respiratory distress, patients may require prolonged observation
since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient. Very rarely, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema. Patients 
with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with a history of airway surgery. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or 
larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0. LISINOPRIL: warnings: 5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly 
provided (See ADVERSE REACTIONS . ) Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE-inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see also 
INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) 
therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema (see PRECAUTIONS ). Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. 
These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. LISINOPRIL: 
warnings: The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be 
included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment 
with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily 
withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure: Sudden and potentially life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in some
patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions 
must be initiated. LISINOPRIL: warnings: Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis 
membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. 
Hypotension and Related Effects Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in uncomplicated hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of lisinopril use in salt/volume-depleted persons such as 
those treated vigorously with diuretics or patients on dialysis. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Syncope has been reported in 0.8 percent of patients receiving lisinopril 
and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. In patients with hypertension receiving lisinopril alone, the incidence of syncope was 0.1 percent.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: WARNINGS Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, and opioids may result in profound sedation, 
respiratory depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is 
made to prescribe clonazepam tablets concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of 
respiratory depression and sedation. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when clonazepam tablets are used with opioids (see
PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction: The use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, exposes users to the risks of abuse,
misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly
involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, 
overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse ) . Before prescribing clonazepam tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g. 
CLONAZEPAM: warnings: using a standardized screening tool). Use of clonazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of clonazepam 
tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances 
associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., opioid analgesics, stimulants); and advise patients on the proper disposal of unused drug. If a substance use disorder is suspected, evaluate the 
patient and institute (or refer them for) early treatment, as appropriate. Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions: To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue 
clonazepam tablets or reduce the dosage (a patient-specific plan should be used to taper the dose) (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Clonazepam Tablets ) .

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: precautions: Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving enalapril and NSAID therapy. In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was 
administered to hypertensive patients receiving enalapril maleate. In this study there was no evidence of a blunting of the antihypertensive action of enalapril maleate. However, reports suggest that 
NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. Other Cardiovascular Agents Enalapril maleate has been used concomitantly with beta adrenergic-blocking agents, methyldopa, nitrates,
calcium-blocking agents, hydralazine, prazosin and digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Enalapril attenuates potassium loss caused
by thiazide-type diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: precautions: spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt 
substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and 
with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. Potassium-sparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure receiving enalapril maleate. Lithium Lithium toxicity has been 
reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. A few cases of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving 
concomitant enalapril maleate and lithium and were reversible upon discontinuation of both drugs. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if enalapril is administered 
concomitantly with lithium. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: precautions: Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on 
therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including enalapril maleate. mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) Inhibitors Patients receiving 
coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ). 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when enalapril was administered for 106 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 90 mg/kg/day or 
for 94 weeks to male and female mice at doses up to 90 and 180 mg/kg/day, respectively. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: precautions: These doses are 26 times (in rats and female mice) and 13 times (in male mice) 
the maximum recommended human daily dose (MRHDD) when compared on a body surface area basis. Neither enalapril maleate nor the active diacid was mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or 
without metabolic activation. Enalapril was also negative in the following genotoxicity studies: rec-assay, reverse mutation assay with E. coli , sister chromatid exchange with cultured mammalian 
cells, and the micronucleus test with mice, as well as in an in vivo cytogenic study using mouse bone marrow. There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance of male and female rats treated 
with up to 90 mg/kg/day of enalapril (26 times the MRHDD when compared on a body surface area basis). Pregnancy Nursing Mothers Enalapril and enalaprilat have been detected in human breast milk. 
ENALAPRIL MALEATE: precautions: Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from enalapril, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue 
enalapril maleate, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Neonates with a History of In Utero Exposure to Enalapril Maleate If oliguria or hypotension occurs, 
direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion. Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and/or substituting for disordered renal 
function. Enalapril, which crosses the placenta, has been removed from neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis with some clinical benefit, and theoretically may be removed by exchange transfusion,
although there is no experience with the latter procedure. Antihypertensive effects of enalapril maleate have been established in hypertensive pediatric patients age 1 month to 16 years.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: nursing_mothers: Nursing Mothers: Risk Summary Clonazepam is excreted in human milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to 
benzodiazepines through breast milk. There are no data on the effects of clonazepam on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the 
mother's clinical need for clonazepam tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from clonazepam tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations 
Infants exposed to clonazepam through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain.         
SOURCE:CLONAZEPAM label


CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, 
the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not 
confirmed these findings. Animal Data In three studies in which clonazepam was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses of 0.2, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis, a 
similar pattern of malformations (cleft palate, open eyelid, fused sternebrae and limb defects) was observed at all doses, in a low, non-dose-related incidence. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: The lowest 
dose tested is less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and similar to the MRHD of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, on a mg/m 2 basis. Reductions in maternal 
weight gain occurred at doses of 5 mg/kg/day or greater and reduction in embryofetal growth occurred in one study at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. No adverse maternal or embryofetal effects were observed in
mice or rats following oral administration of clonazepam during organogenesis of doses up to 15 or 40 mg/kg/day, respectively (4 and 20 times the MRHD of 20 mg/day for seizure disorders and 20 and 100
times the MRHD of 4 mg/day for panic disorder, respectively, on a mg/m 2 basis). CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of adverse developmental effects 
(long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function) in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines. Nursing Mothers: Risk Summary Clonazepam is excreted in human milk. There 
are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. There are no data on the effects of clonazepam on milk production. The 
developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clonazepam tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from 
clonazepam tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to clonazepam through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight 
gain. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Pediatric Use: Because of the possibility that adverse effects on physical or mental development could become apparent only after many years, a benefit-risk 
consideration of the long-term use of clonazepam tablets is important in pediatric patients being treated for seizure disorder (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Safety and 
effectiveness in pediatric patients with panic disorder below the age of 18 have not been established. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of clonazepam tablets did not include sufficient numbers of 
subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and 
younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, 
renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Because clonazepam undergoes hepatic metabolism, it is possible that liver disease will impair 
clonazepam elimination. Metabolites of clonazepam tablets are excreted by the kidneys; to avoid their excess accumulation, caution should be exercised in the administration of the drug to patients 
with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased hepatic and/or renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to assess hepatic 
and/or renal function at the time of dose selection. Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over-sedation in the elderly; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of clonazepam 
tablets and observed closely.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline
in GFR, end state renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group. In general, avoid combined use of RAS 
inhibitors. Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with 
lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with PRINZIDE in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other Agents: Lisinopril has been used 
concomitantly with nitrates and/or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: No meaningful clinically important pharmacokinetic 
interactions occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol, digoxin, or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril. 
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, 
triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is 
indicated, because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving 
lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and
the ACE inhibitor. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial 
flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including lisinopril and
hydrochlorothiazide tablets. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors: Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) 
therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. (see WARNINGS ) Neprilysin Inhibitors: Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema. LISINOPRIL: 
drug_interactions: (see WARNINGS ) Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics - potentiation of 
orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) - dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other antihypertensive drugs - additive effect or 
potentiation. Cholestyramine and colestipol resins - Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol 
resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH - intensified electrolyte depletion, 
particularly hypokalemia. Pressor amines (e.g. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: norepinephrine) - possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal muscle 
relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) - possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium - should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal 
clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. 
Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatoryDrugs - In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, 
potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.

polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including enalapril maleate) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck 
Angioedema Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including enalapril maleate. 
This may occur at any time during treatment. In such cases enalapril maleate should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained 
resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: In instances where swelling has been confined to the face and lips the condition has generally resolved without treatment, 
although antihistamines have been useful in relieving symptoms. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause 
airway obstruction, appropriate therapy, e.g., subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0.5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway, should be promptly provided (see ADVERSE
REACTIONS ). Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may 
be at increased risk for angioedema (see PRECAUTIONS ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These 
patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was 
diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential 
diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving 
an ACE inhibitor (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while 
receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily 
withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes 
and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. Hypotension 
Excessive hypotension is rare in uncomplicated hypertensive patients treated with enalapril maleate alone. Patients with heart failure given enalapril maleate commonly have some reduction in blood 
pressure, especially with the first dose, but discontinuation of therapy for continuing symptomatic hypotension usually is not necessary when dosing instructions are followed; caution should be 
observed when initiating therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: warnings: Patients at risk for excessive hypotension, sometimes associated with oliguria and/or progressive 
azotemia, and rarely with acute renal failure and/or death, include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure, hyponatremia, high-dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive 
diuresis or increase in diuretic dose, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology. It may be advisable to eliminate the diuretic (except in patients with heart failure), 
reduce the diuretic dose or increase salt intake cautiously before initiating therapy with enalapril maleate in patients at risk for excessive hypotension who are able to tolerate such adjustments 
(see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS ).

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). The use of benzodiazepines, 
including clonazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. CLONAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing clonazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue clonazepam tablets
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .

        Question: Does CLONAZEPAM increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether CLONAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.
2. FDAHandler responded that Clonazepam does not list angioedema as a reported adverse reaction. The adverse reactions listed for clonazepam include various other effects but do not mention an 
increase or decrease in the risk of angioedema.
        -----
        Final answer: According to FDA data, Clonazepam does not list angioedema as a reported adverse reaction, which means there is no information available to suggest that Clonazepam increases or 
decreases the risk of angioedema.

The final answer to the question "Does CLONAZEPAM increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?" is that according to FDA data, Clonazepam does not list angioedema as a reported adverse reaction. This 
means there is no information available to suggest that Clonazepam increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.
