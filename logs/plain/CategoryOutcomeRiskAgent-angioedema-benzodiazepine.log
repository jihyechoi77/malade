                Passages:
                1. Drug LORAZEPAM: The available information from the LORAZEPAM label does not indicate that lorazepam increases or decreases the risk of angioedema. The adverse reactions listed for 
lorazepam include various CNS effects, respiratory depression, and other effects such as sedation, dizziness, weakness, and unsteadiness, but angioedema is not mentioned as a known adverse reaction.
2. Drug DIAZEPAM: DO-NOT-KNOW

I attempted to obtain information on whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of angioedema by querying FDAHandler. However, despite multiple attempts, I did not receive any response from 
FDAHandler. Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable answer based on FDA label data.
3. Drug CLONAZEPAM: The final answer to the question "Does CLONAZEPAM increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?" is that according to FDA data, Clonazepam does not list angioedema as a reported 
adverse reaction. This means there is no information available to suggest that Clonazepam increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.

                Does the benzodiazepine category of drugs increase the risk of
                angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the benzodiazepine category of drugs increase the risk of angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passage for LORAZEPAM indicates that angioedema is not listed as a known adverse reaction for lorazepam.
2. The passage for DIAZEPAM does not provide any information regarding the risk of angioedema because the data could not be obtained from FDAHandler.
3. The passage for CLONAZEPAM states that angioedema is not listed as a reported adverse reaction for clonazepam according to FDA data.
4. Based on the available information, there is no evidence to suggest that the benzodiazepine category of drugs either increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the benzodiazepine category of drugs on the risk of angioedema.
