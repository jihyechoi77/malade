                Passages:
                1. Drug METOPROLOL TARTRATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data does not specify whether METOPROLOL TARTRATE increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the effect of METOPROLOL TARTRATE on the 
risk of developing aplastic anemia based on the available FDA label information.
2. Drug LABETALOL: The FDA label for LABETALOL does not indicate an increased risk of aplastic anemia. While it mentions other hematologic adverse effects, aplastic anemia is not mentioned, suggesting
that there is no verified causal relationship between LABETALOL and aplastic anemia according to the label information.
3. Drug ATENOLOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether ATENOLOL increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. I consulted FDAHandler to inquire about this potential association. FDAHandler's response indicated that aplastic 
anemia is not listed as a potential adverse effect or risk associated with atenolol in the provided extracts from the atenolol label. Therefore, based on the information available from the FDA label 
data, we cannot determine whether atenolol has any effect on the risk of aplastic anemia.

                Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of
                aplastic anemia, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of aplastic anemia, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for METOPROLOL TARTRATE does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.
2. The FDA label for LABETALOL does not indicate an increased risk of aplastic anemia, suggesting no verified causal relationship.
3. The FDA label data for ATENOLOL does not list aplastic anemia as a potential adverse effect, so we cannot determine its effect on the risk of aplastic anemia.
4. Based on the available information, there is no clear evidence that the beta blocker category of drugs as a whole increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the beta blocker category of drugs on the risk of aplastic anemia.
