                Passages:
                1. Drug DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE could potentially increase the risk of bleeding, especially in patients on anticoagulant therapy, due to its effect on depressing 
plasma prothrombin activity.
2. Drug TIGECYCLINE: Tigecycline may increase the risk of bleeding due to its potential effect on blood coagulation parameters, specifically by causing hypofibrinogenemia. Patients taking tigecycline 
should monitor their blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen levels.
3. Drug MINOCYCLINE: MINOCYCLINE has been shown to potentially increase the risk of bleeding by depressing plasma prothrombin activity. This information is based on the MINOCYCLINE label, which 
indicates that patients on anticoagulant therapy may need to adjust their dosage when taking MINOCYCLINE.

                Does the tetracycline category of drugs increase the risk of
                bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the tetracycline category of drugs increase the risk of bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passage for DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE indicates that it could potentially increase the risk of bleeding, especially in patients on anticoagulant therapy, due to its effect on depressing 
plasma prothrombin activity.
2. The passage for TIGECYCLINE states that it may increase the risk of bleeding due to its potential effect on blood coagulation parameters, specifically by causing hypofibrinogenemia.
3. The passage for MINOCYCLINE shows that it has been shown to potentially increase the risk of bleeding by depressing plasma prothrombin activity, particularly in patients on anticoagulant therapy.
4. All three drugs mentioned, which belong to the tetracycline category, have been associated with an increased risk of bleeding through various mechanisms affecting blood coagulation.
5. There is a consistent pattern across the drugs in the tetracycline category that suggests an increased risk of bleeding.
