CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: In most patients studied, after oral administration of a single dose of enalapril, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour with peak 
reduction of blood pressure achieved by four to six hours. At recommended doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours. In some patients the effects may diminish toward 
the end of the dosing interval (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Hypertension ). In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require several weeks of therapy. The 
antihypertensive effects of enalapril maleate have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of enalapril maleate has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure. In 
hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with an increase in cardiac output and little or 
no change in heart rate. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: Following administration of enalapril maleate, there is an increase in renal blood flow; glomerular filtration rate is usually 
unchanged. The effects appear to be similar in patients with renovascular hypertension. When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate are 
approximately additive. In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to hypertensive patients receiving enalapril maleate. In this study there was no evidence of a 
blunting of the antihypertensive action of enalapril maleate (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Heart Failure In trials in patients treated with digitalis and diuretics, treatment with enalapril 
resulted in decreased systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and heart size, and increased cardiac output and exercise tolerance. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: Heart rate was unchanged or slightly reduced, and mean ejection fraction was unchanged or increased. There was a beneficial effect on severity of heart failure as measured by 
the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and on symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue. Hemodynamic effects were observed after the first dose and appeared to be maintained in uncontrolled 
studies lasting as long as four months. Effects on exercise tolerance, heart size, and severity and symptoms of heart failure were observed in placebo-controlled studies lasting from eight weeks to 
over one year. Heart Failure, Mortality Trials In a multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 2,569 patients with all degrees of symptomatic heart failure and ejection fraction ≤35 percent were 
randomized to placebo or enalapril and followed for up to 55 months (SOLVD-Treatment). Use of enalapril was associated with an 11 percent reduction in all-cause mortality and a 30 percent reduction in
hospitalization for heart failure. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: Diseases that excluded patients from enrollment in the study included severe stable angina (>2 attacks/day), 
hemodynamically significant valvular or outflow tract obstruction, renal failure (creatinine >2.5 mg/dL), cerebrovascular disease (e.g., significant carotid artery disease), advanced pulmonary 
disease, malignancies, active myocarditis and constrictive pericarditis. The mortality benefit associated with enalapril does not appear to depend upon digitalis being present. A second multicenter 
trial used the SOLVD protocol for study of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. SOLVD-Prevention patients, who had left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35 percent and no history of 
symptomatic heart failure, were randomized to placebo (n=2,117) or enalapril (n=2,111) and followed for up to 5 years. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: The majority of patients in the 
SOLVD-Prevention trial had a history of ischemic heart disease. A history of myocardial infarction was present in 80 percent of patients, current angina pectoris in 34 percent, and a history of 
hypertension in 37 percent. No statistically significant mortality effect was demonstrated in this population. Enalapril-treated subjects had 32 percent fewer first hospitalizations for heart failure,
and 32 percent fewer total heart failure hospitalizations. Compared to placebo, 32 percent fewer patients receiving enalapril developed symptoms of overt heart failure. Hospitalizations for 
cardiovascular reasons were also reduced. There was an insignificant reduction in hospitalizations for any cause in the enalapril treatment group (for enalapril vs. placebo, respectively, 1166 vs. 
1201 first hospitalizations, 2649 vs. 2840 total hospitalizations), although the study was not powered to look for such an effect.

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are
effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate and thiazides are approximately 
additive. Heart Failure Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients 
enalapril maleate improves symptoms, increases survival, and decreases the frequency of hospitalization (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of 
survival trials). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 
≤35 percent), enalapril maleate tablets, USP decreases the rate of development of overt heart failure and decreases the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart
Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of survival trials). In using enalapril maleate, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 
captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that enalapril maleate does not 
have a similar risk (see WARNINGS , Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: In considering use of enalapril maleate, it should be noted that in controlled clinical 
trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, it should be noted that black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been 
reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ).

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: Pharmacodynamics and Clinical Effects Hypertension Administration of enalapril maleate to patients with hypertension of severity ranging from mild to 
severe results in a reduction of both supine and standing blood pressure usually with no orthostatic component. Symptomatic postural hypotension is therefore infrequent, although it might be 
anticipated in volume-depleted patients (see WARNINGS, Hypotension ). In most patients studied, after oral administration of a single dose of enalapril, onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at 
one hour with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by four to six hours. At recommended doses, antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours. In some patients the effects 
may diminish toward the end of the dosing interval (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Hypertension ). In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require several weeks of 
therapy. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: The antihypertensive effects of enalapril maleate have continued during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of enalapril maleate has not been associated 
with a rapid increase in blood pressure. In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension, blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with 
an increase in cardiac output and little or no change in heart rate. Following administration of enalapril maleate, there is an increase in renal blood flow; glomerular filtration rate is usually 
unchanged. The effects appear to be similar in patients with renovascular hypertension. When given together with thiazide-type diuretics, the blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate are 
approximately additive. In a clinical pharmacology study, indomethacin or sulindac was administered to hypertensive patients receiving enalapril maleate. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: In this 
study there was no evidence of a blunting of the antihypertensive action of enalapril maleate (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Heart Failure In trials in patients treated with digitalis and 
diuretics, treatment with enalapril resulted in decreased systemic vascular resistance, blood pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and heart size, and increased cardiac output and exercise 
tolerance. Heart rate was unchanged or slightly reduced, and mean ejection fraction was unchanged or increased. There was a beneficial effect on severity of heart failure as measured by the New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) classification and on symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue. Hemodynamic effects were observed after the first dose and appeared to be maintained in uncontrolled studies lasting as 
long as four months. Effects on exercise tolerance, heart size, and severity and symptoms of heart failure were observed in placebo-controlled studies lasting from eight weeks to over one year. 
ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: Heart Failure, Mortality Trials In a multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 2,569 patients with all degrees of symptomatic heart failure and ejection 
fraction ≤35 percent were randomized to placebo or enalapril and followed for up to 55 months (SOLVD-Treatment). Use of enalapril was associated with an 11 percent reduction in all-cause mortality and

significant mortality effect was demonstrated in this population. Enalapril-treated subjects had 32 percent fewer first hospitalizations for heart failure, and 32 percent fewer total heart failure 
hospitalizations. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: Compared to placebo, 32 percent fewer patients receiving enalapril developed symptoms of overt heart failure. Hospitalizations for cardiovascular
reasons were also reduced. There was an insignificant reduction in hospitalizations for any cause in the enalapril treatment group (for enalapril vs. placebo, respectively, 1166 vs. 1201 first 
hospitalizations, 2649 vs. 2840 total hospitalizations), although the study was not powered to look for such an effect. The SOLVD-Prevention trial was not designed to determine whether treatment of 
asymptomatic patients with low ejection fraction would be superior, with respect to preventing hospitalization, to closer follow-up and use of enalapril at the earliest sign of heart failure. 
ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: However, under the conditions of follow-up in the SOLVD-Prevention trial (every 4 months at the study clinic; personal physician as needed), 68 percent of patients
on placebo who were hospitalized for heart failure had no prior symptoms recorded which would have signaled initiation of treatment. The SOLVD-Prevention trial was also not designed to show whether 
enalapril modified the progression of underlying heart disease. In another multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (CONSENSUS) limited to patients with NYHA Class IV congestive heart failure and 
radiographic evidence of cardiomegaly, use of enalapril was associated with improved survival. The results are shown in the following table. SURVIVAL (%) Six Months One Year Enalapril Maleate (n=127) 
74 64 Placebo (n=126) 56 48 In both CONSENSUS and SOLVD-Treatment trials, patients were also usually receiving digitalis, diuretics or both.

The question regarding whether ENALAPRIL MALEATE increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture cannot be answered without specific data from the FDA label. I have sent a query to FDAHandler but have
not received a response, which is necessary to provide an informed answer. Therefore, I do not have the information required to determine the effect of ENALAPRIL MALEATE on the risk of hip fracture.
