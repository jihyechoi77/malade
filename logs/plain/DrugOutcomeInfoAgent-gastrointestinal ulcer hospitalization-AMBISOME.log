reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with Am B isome administration; on occasion this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the 
reaction developed within a few minutes after the start of infusion and disappeared rapidly when the infusion was stopped. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: The symptoms do not occur with every dose and 
usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse 
events also have been reported in 2% to 10% of Am B isome-treated patients receiving chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, or who had HIV disease in six comparative, clinical trials: Body as a

CONTENT: AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Therapeutic success required (a) resolution of fever during the neutropenic period, (b) absence of an emergent fungal infection, (c) patient survival for at least 
7 days post therapy, (d) no discontinuation of therapy due to toxicity or lack of efficacy, and (e) resolution of any study-entry fungal infection. The overall therapeutic success rates for Am B isome
and the amphotericin B deoxycholate were equivalent. Results are summarized in the following table. Note: The categories presented below are not mutually exclusive. Empirical Therapy in Febrile 
Neutropenic Patients: Randomized, Double-Blind Study in 687 Patients AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/day Number of patients receiving at least one dose of study drug 343 344 Overall

colony-stimulating factors. The incidence of mycologically-confirmed, and clinically-diagnosed, emergent fungal infections are presented in the following table. Am B isome and amphotericin B were 
found to be equivalent with respect to the total number of emergent fungal infections. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Empirical Therapy in Febrile Neutropenic Patients: Emergent Fungal Infections

group and 7 of 10 in the amphotericin B group. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Study 97-0-034, a randomized, double-blind, comparative multi-center trial, evaluated the safety of Am B isome (3 and 5 
mg/kg/day) compared with amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day) in the empirical treatment of 202 adult and 42 pediatric neutropenic patients. One hundred and sixty-six (166) patients received Am 
B isome (85 patients received 3 mg/kg/day and 81 received 5 mg/kg/day) and 78 patients received amphotericin B lipid complex. The study patients were febrile despite having received at least 72 hours 
of broad spectrum antibacterial therapy. The primary endpoint of this study was safety. The study was not designed to draw statistically meaningful conclusions related to comparative efficacy and, in 
fact, Abelcet is not labeled for this indication. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Two supportive, prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative multi-center studies examined the efficacy of two dosages
of Am B isome (1 and 3 mg/kg/day) compared to amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of neutropenic patients with presumed fungal infections. These patients were undergoing 
chemotherapy as part of a bone marrow transplant or had hematological disease. Study 104-10 enrolled adult patients (n = 134). Study 104-14 enrolled pediatric patients (n = 214). Both studies support 
the efficacy equivalence of Am B isome and amphotericin B as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients.

chills/rigors 5 (6%) 8 (9%) 42 (48%) Patients with nausea 11 (13%) 13 (14%) 18 (20%) Patients with vomiting 14 (16%) 13 (14%) 16 (18%) Respiratory adverse events 0 1 (1%) 8 (9%) There have been a few 
reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with Am B isome administration; on occasion this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the 
reaction developed within a few minutes after the start of infusion and disappeared rapidly when the infusion was stopped. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: The symptoms do not occur with every dose and 
usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse 
events also have been reported in 2% to 10% of Am B isome-treated patients receiving chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, or who had HIV disease in six comparative, clinical trials: Body as a 
Whole Abdomen enlarged, allergic reaction, cellulitis, cell-mediated immunological reaction, face edema, graft-versus-host disease, malaise, neck pain, and procedural complication. Cardiovascular 
System Arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiomegaly, hemorrhage, postural hypotension, valvular heart disease, vascular disorder, and vasodilatation (flushing).

CONTENT: AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Therapeutic success required (a) resolution of fever during the neutropenic period, (b) absence of an emergent fungal infection, (c) patient survival for at least 
7 days post therapy, (d) no discontinuation of therapy due to toxicity or lack of efficacy, and (e) resolution of any study-entry fungal infection. The overall therapeutic success rates for Am B isome
and the amphotericin B deoxycholate were equivalent. Results are summarized in the following table. Note: The categories presented below are not mutually exclusive. Empirical Therapy in Febrile 
Neutropenic Patients: Randomized, Double-Blind Study in 687 Patients AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/day Number of patients receiving at least one dose of study drug 343 344 Overall

treated as failures due to premature discontinuation alone. This therapeutic equivalence had no apparent relationship to the use of prestudy antifungal prophylaxis or concomitant granulocytic 
colony-stimulating factors. The incidence of mycologically-confirmed, and clinically-diagnosed, emergent fungal infections are presented in the following table. Am B isome and amphotericin B were 
found to be equivalent with respect to the total number of emergent fungal infections. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Empirical Therapy in Febrile Neutropenic Patients: Emergent Fungal Infections 
AmBisome 3 mg/kg/day Amphotericin B 0.6 mg/kg/day Number of patients receiving at least one dose of study drug 343 344 Mycologically-confirmed fungal infection 11 (3.2%) 27 (7.8%) Clinically-diagnosed
fungal infection 32 (9.3%) 16 (4.7%) Total emergent fungal infections 43 (12.5%) 43 (12.5%) Mycologically-confirmed fungal infections at study entry were cured in 8 of 11 patients in the Am B isome 
group and 7 of 10 in the amphotericin B group. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Study 97-0-034, a randomized, double-blind, comparative multi-center trial, evaluated the safety of Am B isome (3 and 5 
mg/kg/day) compared with amphotericin B lipid complex (5 mg/kg/day) in the empirical treatment of 202 adult and 42 pediatric neutropenic patients. One hundred and sixty-six (166) patients received Am 
B isome (85 patients received 3 mg/kg/day and 81 received 5 mg/kg/day) and 78 patients received amphotericin B lipid complex. The study patients were febrile despite having received at least 72 hours 
of broad spectrum antibacterial therapy. The primary endpoint of this study was safety. The study was not designed to draw statistically meaningful conclusions related to comparative efficacy and, in 
fact, Abelcet is not labeled for this indication. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: Two supportive, prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative multi-center studies examined the efficacy of two dosages
of Am B isome (1 and 3 mg/kg/day) compared to amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of neutropenic patients with presumed fungal infections. These patients were undergoing 
chemotherapy as part of a bone marrow transplant or had hematological disease. Study 104-10 enrolled adult patients (n = 134). Study 104-14 enrolled pediatric patients (n = 214). Both studies support 
the efficacy equivalence of Am B isome and amphotericin B as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients.

        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that the available information from the AMBISOME label does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. The adverse

The available information from the AMBISOME label does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. The adverse reactions section lists 
various side effects, but gastrointestinal ulcers requiring hospitalization are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the
risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
