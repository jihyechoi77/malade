                Passages:
                1. Drug LISINOPRIL: The FDA label for LISINOPRIL does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.
2. Drug CAPTOPRIL: The final answer to the question "Does CAPTOPRIL increase or decrease the risk of bleeding?" is as follows:

The CAPTOPRIL label does not directly state that the drug increases the risk of bleeding. However, it does list thrombocytopenia as a potential adverse reaction, which could increase the risk of 
bleeding. The degree of risk associated with CAPTOPRIL in terms of causing bleeding is not specified in the label, and therefore, the relationship is not definitively established.
3. Drug ENALAPRIL MALEATE: The final answer to the question "Does ENALAPRIL MALEATE increase or decrease the risk of bleeding?" is as follows:

ENALAPRIL MALEATE does not specifically list an increase or decrease in the risk of bleeding as a known side effect according to the label. However, it does mention rare cases of thrombocytopenia, 
which could potentially increase the risk of bleeding. The degree of risk associated with ENALAPRIL MALEATE in terms of bleeding is not clearly defined, but the occurrence of thrombocytopenia is 
considered rare.

        Question: Does the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs increase the risk of bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for LISINOPRIL does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.
2. The CAPTOPRIL label lists thrombocytopenia as a potential adverse reaction, which could increase the risk of bleeding, but the relationship is not definitively established.
3. ENALAPRIL MALEATE mentions rare cases of thrombocytopenia, which could potentially increase the risk of bleeding, but the degree of risk is not clearly defined and the occurrence is considered 
rare.
4. Since two of the drugs (CAPTOPRIL and ENALAPRIL MALEATE) mention thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding, there is a potential association between angiotensin converting enzyme 
inhibitors and increased risk of bleeding. However, the evidence is weak as the labels do not definitively establish this relationship and the occurrences are rare or not clearly defined.
5. For LISINOPRIL, there is no information provided regarding the risk of bleeding.
6. Overall, the evidence is not strong enough to definitively state that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as a category increase the risk of bleeding.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs on the risk of bleeding.
