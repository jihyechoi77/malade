        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. From the provided list, the drugs that are variants of phenytoin are identified.
2. The usage rates from the medical database query are matched to the drugs on the provided list, with preference given to generic names and the most basic variant of a given drug.
3. The drugs with the highest usage rates are selected as the most common representatives.
4. The drugs 'PHENYTOIN SODIUM', 'PHENYTOIN', and 'DILANTIN' are selected because they have the highest usage rates and are the most basic variants of phenytoin on the list.
