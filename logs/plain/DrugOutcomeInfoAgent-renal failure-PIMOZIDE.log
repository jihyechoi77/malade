CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: DRUG INTERACTIONS Because pimozide prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, an additive effect on QT interval would be anticipated if administered with 
other drugs, such as phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants or antiarrhythmic agents, which prolong the QT interval. Accordingly, pimozide should not be given with dofetilide, sotalol, quinidine, 
other Class Ia and III anti-arrhythmics, mesoridazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, droperidol, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, halofantrine, mefloquine, pentamidine, arsenic trioxide, 
levomethadyl acetate, dolasetron mesylate, probucol, tacrolimus, ziprasidone, or other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects. PIMOZIDE: 
drug_interactions: Also, the use of macrolide antibiotics in patients with prolonged QT intervals has been rarely associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Such concomitant administration should not be
undertaken (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Since pimozide is partly metabolized via CYP 3A4, it should not be administered concomitantly with inhibitors of this metabolic system, such as azole antifungal 
agents and protease inhibitor drugs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Pimozide and Celexa: In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg coadministered with racemic citalopram 40 mg given once daily 
for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Racemic citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The 
mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known. PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: Concomitant use of Pimozide and Celexa or Lexapro is contraindicated (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). CYP 2D6 
inhibitors: In healthy subjects, co-administration of pimozide 2 mg (single dose) and paroxetine 60 mg resulted in a 151% increase in pimozide AUC and a 62% increase in pimozide C max compared to 
pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and C max is related to the CYP 2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine. Concomitant use of pimozide and paroxetine or other strong CYP 2D6 
inhibitors are contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: As CYP 1A2 may also contribute to the metabolism of pimozide, prescribers should be aware of the theoretical 
potential for drug interactions with inhibitors of this enzymatic system. Pimozide may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants, including analgesics, sedatives, anxiolytics, and alcohol. Rare case 
reports have suggested possible additive effects of pimozide and fluoxetine leading to bradycardia. Concomitant administration of pimozide and sertraline should be contraindicated (See 
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pharmacogenomics Individuals with genetic variations resulting in poor CYP 2D6 metabolism (approximately 5 to 10% of the population) exhibit higher pimozide concentrations than 
extensive CYP 2D6 metabolizers. PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: The concentrations observed in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers are similar to those seen with strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine. The 
time to achieve steady state Pimozide concentrations is expected to be longer (approximately 2 weeks) in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers because of the prolonged half-life. Alternative dosing strategies are
recommended in patients who are genetically poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ). Interaction with Food Patients should avoid grapefruit juice because it may inhibit the 
metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: warnings: ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association 
with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or 
blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. The 
diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness
(e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). PIMOZIDE: warnings: Other important considerations in the differential 
diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of 
antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for 
which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after
recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Hyperpyrexia, 
not associated with the above symptom complex, has been reported with other antipsychotic drugs. Other Sudden, unexpected deaths have occurred in experimental studies of conditions other than 
Tourette’s Disorder. PIMOZIDE: warnings: These deaths occurred while patients were receiving dosages in the range of 1 mg per kg. One possible mechanism for such deaths is prolongation of the QT 
interval predisposing patients to ventricular arrhythmia. An electrocardiogram should be performed before pimozide treatment is initiated and periodically thereafter, especially during the period of 
dose adjustment. Pimozide may have a tumorigenic potential. Based on studies conducted in mice, it is known that pimozide can produce a dose-related increase in pituitary tumors. The full significance
of this finding is not known, but should be taken into consideration in the physician’s and patient’s decisions to use this drug product. This finding should be given special consideration when the 
patient is young and chronic use of pimozide is anticipated (see PRECAUTIONS - Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ).

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: contraindications: Macrolide antibiotics are inhibitors of CYP 3A4, and thus could potentially impede pimozide metabolism. For these reasons, pimozide is contraindicated in patients
receiving the macrolide antibiotics clarithromycin, erythromycin, azithromycin,dirithromycin, and troleandomycin. 7. Concomitant use in patients taking Celexa or Lexapro is contraindicated (see 
Precautions - Drug Interactions - Pimozide and Celexa ). 8. Clinical drug interaction studies have demonstrated that pimozide is also metabolized by CYP 2D6. Concomitant use of pimozide with 
paroxetine and other strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors is contraindicated (See PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions ). 9. PIMOZIDE: contraindications: Concomitant use of pimozide in patients taking sertraline is 
contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS – Drug Interactions ). Because azole antifungal agents are also inhibitors of the CYP 3A4 enzymes and thus may likewise impair pimozide metabolism, pimozide is 
contraindicated in patients receiving the azole antifungal agents itraconazole and ketoconazole. Similarly, protease inhibitor drugs are also inhibitors of CYP 3A4, and thus pimozide is 
contraindicated in patients receiving protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, saquinovir, indinavir, and nelfinavir. (See PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions .) Nefazodone is a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4,
and its concomitant use with pimozide is also contraindicated. PIMOZIDE: contraindications: Other drugs that are relatively less potent inhibitors of CYP 3A4 should also be avoided, in view of the 
risks: e.g. zileuton, fluvoxamine.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, 
pimozide causes a dose-related increase in pituitary and mammary tumors. When mice were treated for up to 18 months with pimozide, pituitary gland changes developed in females only. These changes were
characterized as hyperplasia at doses approximating the human dose and adenoma at doses about fifteen times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg per kg basis. The mechanism for the induction of 
pituitary tumors in mice is not known. Mammary gland tumors in female mice were also increased, but these tumors are expected in rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs which elevate prolactin 
levels. Chronic administration of an antipsychotic also causes elevated prolactin levels in humans. PIMOZIDE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Tissue culture experiments 
indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a 
previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of 
elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of these 
drugs and mammary tumorigenesis. The available evidence, however, is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, animals received up to 50 times 
the maximum recommended human dose. No increased incidence of overall tumors or tumors at any site was observed in either sex. Because of the limited number of animals surviving this study, the 
meaning of these results is unclear. PIMOZIDE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Pimozide did not have mutagenic activity in the Ames test with four bacterial test strains, 
in the mouse dominant lethal test or in the micronucleus test in rats. Reproduction studies in animals were not adequate to assess all aspects of fertility. Nevertheless, female rats administered 
pimozide had prolonged estrus cycles, an effect also produced by other antipsychotic drugs.

ANSWER: The available information from the PIMOZIDE label does not indicate that pimozide increases the risk of renal failure. However, it does mention that Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a 
potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes associated with antipsychotic drugs, can include acute renal failure as one of its possible complications. It is important to note that NMS is a rare 
condition and the occurrence of acute renal failure would be within that context.
