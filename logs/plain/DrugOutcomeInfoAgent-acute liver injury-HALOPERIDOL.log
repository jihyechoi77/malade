CONTENT: HALOPERIDOL: warnings: WARNINGS Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are 
at an increased risk of death. Haloperidol is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see BOXED WARNING ). Cardiovascular Effects Cases of sudden death, 
QT-prolongation, and Torsades de pointes have been reported in patients receiving haloperidol. Higher than recommended doses of any formulation of haloperidol appear to be associated with a higher 
risk of QT-prolongation and Torsades de pointes. Although cases have been reported even in the absence of predisposing factors, particular caution is advised in treating patients with other 
QT-prolonging conditions (including electrolyte imbalance , drugs known to prolong QT, underlying cardiac abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and familial long QT-syndrome). HALOPERIDOL: warnings: Tardive 
Dyskinesia A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome 
appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely
to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it
will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can 
develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. HALOPERIDOL: warnings: There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although 
the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the 
syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, 
antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who
suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or 
appropriate.

CONTENT: HALOPERIDOL: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis In clinical trial and post-marketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia have been reported 
temporally related to antipsychotic agents, including haloperidol. Agranulocytosis (including fatal cases) has also been reported. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting 
low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a preexisting low WBC or a history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete 
blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and should discontinue haloperidol at the first sign of a decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. 
HALOPERIDOL: precautions: Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with 
severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm 3 ) should discontinue haloperidol and have their WBC followed until recovery. Haloperidol should be administered cautiously to patients: -with
severe cardiovascular disorders, because of the possibility of transient hypotension and/or precipitation of anginal pain. Should hypotension occur and a vasopressor be required, epinephrine should 
not be used since haloperidol may block its vasopressor activity and paradoxical further lowering of the blood pressure may occur. Instead, metaraminol, phenylephrine or norepinephrine should be used.
-receiving anticonvulsant medications, with a history of seizures, or with EEG abnormalities, because haloperidol may lower the convulsive threshold. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: If indicated, adequate 
anticonvulsant therapy should be concomitantly maintained. -with known allergies, or with a history of allergic reactions to drugs. -receiving anticoagulants, since an isolated instance of 
interference occurred with the effects of one anticoagulant (phenindione). If concomitant antiparkinson medication is required, it may have to be continued after haloperidol is discontinued because of
the difference in excretion rates. If both are discontinued simultaneously, extrapyramidal symptoms may occur. The physician should keep in mind the possible increase in intraocular pressure when 
anticholinergic drugs, including antiparkinson agents, are administered concomitantly with haloperidol. As with other antipsychotic agents, it should be noted that haloperidol may be capable of 
potentiating CNS depressants such as anesthetics, opiates, and alcohol. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: In a study of 12 schizophrenic patients coadministered haloperidol and rifampin, plasma haloperidol 
levels were decreased by a mean of 70% and mean scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were increased from baseline. In five other schizophrenic patients treated with haloperidol and rifampin, 
discontinuation of rifampin produced a mean 3.3-fold increase in haloperidol concentrations. Thus, careful monitoring of clinical status is warranted when rifampin is administered or discontinued in 
haloperidol-treated patients. When haloperidol is used to control mania in cyclic disorders, there may be a rapid mood swing to depression. Severe neurotoxicity (rigidity, inability to walk or talk) 
may occur in patients with thyrotoxicosis who are also receiving antipsychotic medication, including haloperidol. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: No mutagenic potential of haloperidol was found in the Ames 
Salmonella microsomal activation assay. Negative or inconsistent positive findings have been obtained in in vitro and in vivo studies of effects of haloperidol on chromosome structure and number. The 
available cytogenetic evidence is considered too inconsistent to be conclusive at this time. Carcinogenicity studies using oral haloperidol were conducted in Wistar rats (dosed at up to 5 mg/kg daily 
for 24 months) and in Albino Swiss mice (dosed at up to 5 mg/kg daily for 18 months). In the rat study, survival was less than optimal in all dose groups, reducing the number of rats at risk for 
developing tumors. However, although a relatively greater number of rats survived to the end of the study in high dose male and female groups, these animals did not have a greater incidence of tumors 
than control animals. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: Therefore, although not optimal, this study does suggest the absence of a haloperidol related increase in the incidence of neoplasia in rats at doses up
to 20 times the usual daily human dose for chronic or resistant patients. In female mice at 5 and 20 times the highest initial daily dose for chronic or resistant patients, there was a statistically 
significant increase in mammary gland neoplasia and total tumor incidence; at 20 times the same daily dose there was a statistically significant increase in pituitary gland neoplasia. In male mice, no
statistically significant differences in incidences of total tumors or specific tumor types were noted. Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic 
administration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these
drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been 
reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of 
antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; 
the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. There are no well controlled studies with haloperidol in pregnant women. There are reports, however, of cases of limb 
malformations observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy. Causal relationships were not 
established in these cases. HALOPERIDOL: precautions: Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, this drug should be used during pregnancy or in women 
likely to become pregnant only if the benefit clearly justifies a potential risk to the fetus. Infants should not be nursed during drug treatment. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric 
patients have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of haloperidol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from 
younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not consistently identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. However, the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia 
appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women (see WARNINGS: Tardive Dyskinesia ). Also, the pharmacokinetics of haloperidol in geriatric patients generally warrants the use of 
lower doses (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

CONTENT: HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Cardiovascular Effects Tachycardia, hypotension, and hypertension have been reported. QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias have 
also been reported, in addition to ECG pattern changes compatible with the polymorphous configuration of Torsades de pointes, and may occur more frequently with high doses and in predisposed patients 
(see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). Cases of sudden and unexpected death have been reported in association with the administration of haloperidol. The nature of the evidence makes it impossible to 
determine definitively what role, if any, haloperidol played in the outcome of the reported cases. The possibility that haloperidol caused death cannot, of course, be excluded, but it is to be kept in
mind that sudden and unexpected death may occur in psychotic patients when they go untreated or when they are treated with other antipsychotic drugs. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: CNS Effects 
Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) EPS during the administration of haloperidol have been reported frequently, often during the first few days of treatment. EPS can be categorized generally as 
Parkinson-like symptoms, akathisia, or dystonia (including opisthotonos and oculogyric crisis). While all can occur at relatively low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity at 
higher doses. The symptoms may be controlled with dose reductions or administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate, USP or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride, USP. It should be noted 
that persistent EPS have been reported; the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases. Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in 
susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, 
swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity with high potency and at
higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs Generally, patients 
receiving short-term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after 
abrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under “Tardive Dyskinesia” except for duration. HALOPERIDOL: 
adverse_reactions: It is not known whether gradual withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs but until further evidence becomes 
available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of haloperidol. Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents, haloperidol has been associated with persistent dyskinesias. Tardive 
dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may occur after drug therapy has been 
discontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on high dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear irreversible. The syndrome is 
characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be 
accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities and the trunk. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; antiparkinson agents usually do not 
alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage
of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked. It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and
if the medication is stopped at that time, the full syndrome may not develop. Tardive Dystonia Tardive dystonia, not associated with the above syndrome, has also been reported. Tardive dystonia is 
characterized by delayed onset of choreic or dystonic movements, is often persistent, and has the potential of becoming irreversible. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: Other CNS Effects Insomnia, 
restlessness, anxiety, euphoria, agitation, drowsiness, depression, lethargy, headache, confusion, vertigo, grand mal seizures, exacerbation of psychotic symptoms including hallucinations and 
catatonic-like behavioral states which may be responsive to drug withdrawal and/or treatment with anticholinergic drugs. Body as a Whole: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), hyperpyrexia and heat 
stroke have been reported with haloperidol. (See WARNINGS for further information concerning NMS.) Hematologic Effects: Reports have appeared citing the occurrence of mild and usually transient 
leukopenia and leukocytosis, minimal decreases in red blood cell counts, anemia, or a tendency toward lymphomonocytosis. Agranulocytosis has rarely been reported to have occurred with the use of 
haloperidol, and then only in association with other medication. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: Liver Effects: Impaired liver function and/or jaundice have been reported. Dermatologic Reactions: 
Maculopapular and acneiform skin reactions and isolated cases of photosensitivity and loss of hair. Endocrine Disorders: Lactation, breast engorgement, mastalgia, menstrual irregularities, 
gynecomastia, impotence, increased libido, hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and hyponatremia. Gastrointestinal Effects: Anorexia, constipation, diarrhea, hypersalivation, dyspepsia, nausea and vomiting. 
Autonomic Reactions: Dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, diaphoresis and priapism. Respiratory Effects: Laryngospasm, bronchospasm and increased depth of respiration. Special Senses: 
Cataracts, retinopathy and visual disturbances. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: Post-marketing Events Hyperammonemia has been reported in a 5-1⁄2 year old child with citrullinemia, an inherited 
disorder of ammonia excretion, following treatment with haloperidol.

CONTENT: HALOPERIDOL: boxed_warning: WARNING Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs 
are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in 
drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was 
about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death)
or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. HALOPERIDOL: boxed_warning: Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may 
increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is
not clear. Haloperidol is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see WARNINGS ).

CONTENT: HALOPERIDOL: safe_handling_warning: OVERDOSAGE Manifestations In general, the symptoms of overdosage would be an exaggeration of known pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions, the most 
prominent of which would be: 1) severe extrapyramidal reactions, 2) hypotension, or 3) sedation. The patient would appear comatose with respiratory depression and hypotension which could be severe 
enough to produce a shock-like state. The extrapyramidal reaction would be manifest by muscular weakness or rigidity and a generalized or localized tremor as demonstrated by the akinetic or agitans 
types respectively. With accidental overdosage, hypertension rather than hypotension occurred in a 2 year old child. The risk of ECG changes associated with Torsades de pointes should be considered. 
(For further information regarding Torsades de pointes, please refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS . HALOPERIDOL: safe_handling_warning: ) Treatment Gastric lavage or induction of emesis should be carried out 
immediately followed by administration of activated charcoal. Since there is no specific antidote, treatment is primarily supportive. A patent airway must be established by use of an oropharyngeal 
airway or endotracheal tube or, in prolonged cases of coma, by tracheostomy. Respiratory depression may be counteracted by artificial respiration and mechanical respirators. Hypotension and 
circulatory collapse may be counteracted by use of intravenous fluids, plasma, or concentrated albumin, and vasopressor agents such as metaraminol, phenylephrine and norepinephrine. Epinephrine should
not be used. In case of severe extrapyramidal reactions, antiparkinson medication should be administered. ECG and vital signs should be monitored especially for signs of Q-T prolongation or 
dysrhythmias and monitoring should continue until the ECG is normal. HALOPERIDOL: safe_handling_warning: Severe arrhythmias should be treated with appropriate antiarrhythmic measures.
