CONTENT: WARFARIN: indications_and_usage: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Warfarin sodium tablets are indicated for: Prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and its extension, pulmonary embolism (PE). 
Prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and/or cardiac valve replacement. Reduction in the risk of death, recurrent myocardial infarction 
(MI), and thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization after myocardial infarction. Limitations of Use Warfarin sodium tablets have no direct effect on an established thrombus, nor 
does it reverse ischemic tissue damage. Once a thrombus has occurred, however, the goals of anticoagulant treatment are to prevent further extension of the formed clot and to prevent secondary 
thromboembolic complications that may result in serious and possibly fatal sequelae. WARFARIN: indications_and_usage: Warfarin sodium tablets are a vitamin K antagonist indicated for: Prophylaxis and 
treatment of venous thrombosis and its extension, pulmonary embolism ( 1 ) Prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation and/or cardiac valve 
replacement ( 1 ) Reduction in the risk of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization after myocardial infarction ( 1 ) Limitations of 
Use Warfarin sodium tablets have no direct effect on an established thrombus, nor does it reverse ischemic tissue damage.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications An INR of greater than 4 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in 
most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE) Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR 
range, 2 to 3) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows: For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment 
with warfarin for 3 months is recommended. For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit
ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. 
For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient. Atrial Fibrillation In patients with 
non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2 to 3). In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at high risk of stroke (i.e., having any of the
following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, or 2 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left 
ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: In 
patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at an intermediate risk of ischemic stroke (i.e., having 1 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or 
severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. For patients with AF 
and mitral stenosis, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended; the target INR 
may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves For patients with a 
bileaflet mechanical valve or a Medtronic Hall (Minneapolis, MN) tilting disk valve in the aortic position who are in sinus rhythm and without left atrial enlargement, therapy with warfarin to a 
target INR of 2.5 (range, 2 to 3) is recommended. For patients with tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3 (range, 2.5 
to 3.5) is recommended. For patients with caged ball or caged disk valves, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) is recommended. For patients with a bioprosthetic valve in the
mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 5 (range, 2 to 3) for the first 3 months after valve insertion is recommended. If additional risk 
factors for thromboembolism are present (AF, previous thromboembolism, left ventricular dysfunction), a target INR of 2.5 (range 2 to 3) is recommended. Post-Myocardial Infarction For high-risk 
patients with MI (e.g., those with a large anterior MI, those with significant heart failure, those with intracardiac thrombus visible on transthoracic echocardiography, those with AF, and those with 
a history of a thromboembolic event), therapy with combined moderate-intensity (INR, 2 to 3) warfarin plus low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/day) for at least 3 months after the MI is recommended. WARFARIN: 
dosage_and_administration: Recurrent Systemic Embolism and Other Indications Oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin has not been fully evaluated by clinical trials in patients with valvular 
disease associated with AF, patients with mitral stenosis, and patients with recurrent systemic embolism of unknown etiology. However, a moderate dose regimen (INR 2 to 3) may be used for these 
patients. 2.3 Initial and Maintenance Dosing The appropriate initial dosing of warfarin sodium tablets varies widely for different patients. Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability 
are known, and the initial dose is influenced by: Clinical factors including age, race, body weight, sex, concomitant medications, and comorbidities Genetic factors (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes)  
Select the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific 
clinical factors. Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients and in Asian patients  . Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may 
increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation. Individualize the duration of therapy for each patient. In general, anticoagulant therapy 
should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed  . Dosing Recommendations without Consideration of Genotype If the patient’s CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the 
initial dose of warfarin sodium tablets is usually 2 to 5 mg once daily.

ANSWER: Warfarin is indicated for the reduction in the risk of death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), and thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization after myocardial 
infarction. Clinical studies, such as the Warfarin Re-Infarction Study (WARIS) and the Warfarin, Aspirin, Re-Infarction Study (WARIS II), have shown that warfarin therapy can lead to a significant

Warfarin decreases the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. This is supported by clinical studies, such as the Warfarin Re-Infarction Study (WARIS) and the Warfarin, Aspirin, Re-Infarction Study 
(WARIS II), which have shown that warfarin therapy can lead to a significant reduction in the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction. In the WARIS study, patients treated with warfarin showed a 34% 
risk reduction in recurrent MI compared to placebo.
