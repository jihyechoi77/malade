CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is a topical antimicrobial drug indicated as an adjunct for the prevention and treatment of
wound sepsis in patients with second and third degree burns.         
SOURCE:SILVER SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: warnings: WARNINGS Absorption of silver sulfadiazine varies depending upon the percent of body surface area and the extent of the tissue damage. Although few have been 
reported, it is possible that any adverse reaction associated with sulfonamides may occur. Some of the reactions which have been associated with sulfonamides are as follows: blood dyscrasias including
agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hemolytic anemia; dermatologic and allergic reactions, including life-threatening cutaneous reactions [Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and exfoliative dermatitis]; gastrointestinal reactions, hepatitis and hepatocellular necrosis; CNS reactions; and toxic nephrosis. There is a potential 
cross-sensitivity between silver sulfadiazine and other sulfonamides. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: warnings: If allergic reactions attributable to treatment with silver sulfadiazine occur, continuation of 
therapy must be weighed against the potential hazards of the particular allergic reaction. Fungal proliferation in and below the eschar may occur. However, the incidence of clinically reported fungal 
superinfection is low. The use of silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% in some cases of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient individuals may be hazardous, as hemolysis may occur.

CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Silver sulfadiazine has broad antimicrobial activity. It is bactericidal for many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as
well as being effective against yeast. Results from in vitro testing are listed below. Sufficient data have been obtained to demonstrate that silver sulfadiazine will inhibit bacteria that are 
resistant to other antimicrobial agents and that the compound is superior to sulfadiazine. Studies utilizing radioactive micronized silver sulfadiazine, electron microscopy, and biochemical techniques
have revealed that the mechanism of action of silver sulfadiazine on bacteria differs from silver nitrate and sodium sulfadiazine. Silver sulfadiazine acts only on the cell membrane and cell wall to 
produce its bactericidal effect. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: clinical_pharmacology: Results of in Vitro Testing With Silver Sulfadiazine Cream, USP 1% Concentration of Silver Sulfadiazine Number of Sensitive

ANSWER: Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1%, is a topical antimicrobial drug indicated as an adjunct for the prevention and treatment of wound sepsis in patients with second and third degree burns. It 
has broad antimicrobial activity, being bactericidal for many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well as effective against yeast. Silver sulfadiazine acts on the cell membrane and cell wall 
to produce its bactericidal effect. It is also noted that silver sulfadiazine can inhibit bacteria resistant to other antimicrobial agents and is not a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, making it useful 
in situations where such agents are contraindicated. However, absorption varies depending on the percent of body surface area and extent of tissue damage, and adverse reactions associated with 
sulfonamides may occur. These reactions can include blood dyscrasias, dermatologic and allergic reactions, gastrointestinal reactions, CNS reactions, and toxic nephrosis. There is potential 
cross-sensitivity between silver sulfadiazine and other sulfonamides. Fungal proliferation may occur, but clinically reported fungal superinfection is low. Use in glucose-6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase-deficient individuals may be hazardous due to the risk of hemolysis. The cream is a soft, white, water dispersible cream containing micronized silver sulfadiazine, and it is supplied in

        Question: Does SILVER SULFADIAZINE increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler about the effects of SILVER SULFADIAZINE.
2. FDAHandler provided information from the drug label, which indicates that adverse reactions associated with sulfonamides, including silver sulfadiazine, may occur. These reactions can include toxic
nephrosis, which is a kidney disorder.
3. Toxic nephrosis can lead to renal failure if severe and untreated.
        -----
        Final answer: SILVER SULFADIAZINE may increase the risk of renal failure due to its potential to cause toxic nephrosis, which is a kidney disorder that can lead to renal failure if severe and 
untreated. However, the frequency of this adverse effect is not specified, so it is not possible to determine how common this risk is.
