CONTENT: ABELCET: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate patients), 
of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 patients were 
treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with ABELCET ® , 9% 
discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient chills and/or fever 
during infusion of the drug. ABELCET: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14 Increased Serum Creatinine 11

ANSWER: ABELCET has been associated with an increased risk of renal failure. Specifically, increased serum creatinine, which is an indicator of decreased renal function, was reported in 11% of 
patients treated with ABELCET in clinical studies. Additionally, kidney failure was reported as an adverse event with an incidence of 5%. However, the causal association between these adverse events 
and ABELCET is uncertain.

        Question: Does ABELCET increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler responded that ABELCET has been associated with an increased risk of renal failure, with increased serum creatinine reported in 11% of patients and kidney failure reported as an adverse 
event with an incidence of 5% in clinical studies. However, the causal association between these adverse events and ABELCET is uncertain.
        -----
        Final answer: ABELCET has been associated with an increased risk of renal failure, as indicated by reports of increased serum creatinine and kidney failure in clinical studies. However, the 
causal relationship between ABELCET and these adverse events is not definitively established.

ABELCET has been associated with an increased risk of renal failure, as indicated by reports of increased serum creatinine in 11% of patients and kidney failure as an adverse event with an incidence 
of 5% in clinical studies. However, it is important to note that the causal relationship between ABELCET and these adverse events is not definitively established.
