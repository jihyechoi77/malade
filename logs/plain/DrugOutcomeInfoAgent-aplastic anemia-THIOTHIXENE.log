CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS Thiothixene capsules are effective in the management of schizophrenia. Thiothixene capsules have not been evaluated in the management of 
behavioral complications in patients with mental retardation.         
SOURCE:THIOTHIXENE label


CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: mechanism_of_action: ACTIONS Thiothixene is an antipsychotic of the thioxanthene series. Thiothixene possesses certain chemical and pharmacological similarities to the piperazine
phenothiazines and differences from the aliphatic group of phenothiazines.         
SOURCE:THIOTHIXENE label


CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS An antiemetic effect was observed in animal studies with thiothixene; since this effect may also occur in man, it is possible that thiothixene may mask 
signs of overdosage of toxic drugs and may obscure conditions such as intestinal obstruction and brain tumor. In consideration of the known capability of thiothixene and certain other psychotropic 
drugs to precipitate convulsions, extreme caution should be used in patients with a history of convulsive disorders or those in a state of alcohol withdrawal, since it may lower the convulsive 
threshold. Although thiothixene potentiates the actions of the barbiturates, the dosage of the anticonvulsant therapy should not be reduced when thiothixene is administered concurrently. Though 
exhibiting rather weak anticholinergic properties, thiothixene should be used with caution in patients who might be exposed to extreme heat or who are receiving atropine or related drugs. THIOTHIXENE:
precautions: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease. Caution as well as careful adjustment of the dosages is indicated when thiothixene is used in conjunction with other CNS 
depressants. Also, careful observation should be made for pigmentary retinopathy and lenticular pigmentation (fine lenticular pigmentation has been noted in a small number of patients treated with 
thiothixene for prolonged periods). Blood dyscrasias (agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura), and liver damage (jaundice, biliary stasis) have been reported with related drugs. 
Antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene 3 , elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Tissue culture experiments indicate that 
approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously 
detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown 
for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date,
however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. THIOTHIXENE:
precautions: Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported 
temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. 
Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of 
therapy and discontinuation of thiothixene should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically 
significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Patients with 
severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue thiothixene and have their WBC followed until recovery. Information for Patients Given the likelihood that some patients 
exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The 
decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided. Drug 
Interactions Hepatic microsomal enzyme inducing agents, such as carbamazepine, were found to significantly increase the clearance of thiothixene. Patients receiving these drugs should be observed for 
signs of reduced thiothixene effectiveness 4,5 . THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Due to a possible additive effect with hypotensive agents, patients receiving these drugs should be observed closely for 
signs of excessive hypotension when thiothixene is added to their drug regimen 6 .

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS Thiothixene capsules are contraindicated in patients with circulatory collapse, comatose states, central nervous system depression due to any
cause, and blood dyscrasias. Thiothixene capsules are contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug. It is not known whether there is a cross sensitivity between the 
thioxanthenes and the phenothiazine derivatives, but this possibility should be considered.         
SOURCE:THIOTHIXENE label


CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS NOTE : Not all of the following adverse reactions have been reported with thiothixene. However, since thiothixene has certain chemical and 
pharmacologic similarities to the phenothiazines, all of the known side effects and toxicity associated with phenothiazine therapy should be borne in mind when thiothixene is used. Cardiovascular 
Effects Tachycardia, hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope. In the event hypotension occurs, epinephrine should not be used as a pressor agent since a paradoxical further lowering of blood 
pressure may result. Nonspecific EKG changes have been observed in some patients receiving thiothixene. These changes are usually reversible and frequently disappear on continued thiothixene therapy. 
The incidence of these changes is lower than that observed with some phenothiazines. The clinical significance of these changes is not known. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: CNS Effects Drowsiness, 
usually mild, may occur although it usually subsides with continuation of thiothixene therapy. The incidence of sedation appears similar to that of the piperazine group of phenothiazines but less than
that of certain aliphatic phenothiazines. Restlessness, agitation and insomnia have been noted with thiothixene. Seizures and paradoxical exacerbation of psychotic symptoms have occurred with 
thiothixene infrequently. Hyperreflexia has been reported in infants delivered from mothers having received structurally related drugs. In addition, phenothiazine derivatives have been associated with
cerebral edema and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities. Extrapyramidal Symptoms Extrapyramidal symptoms, such as pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia have been reported (see Dystonia, Class effect
). Management of these extra-pyramidal symptoms depends upon the type and severity. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Rapid relief of acute symptoms may require the use of an injectable antiparkinson 
agent. More slowly emerging symptoms may be managed by reducing the dosage of thiothixene and/or administering an oral antiparkinson agent. Dystonia Class effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged 
abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to 
tightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity
with high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: 
Persistent Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy with thiothixene 1 or may occur after drug therapy has been 
discontinued. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing 
movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. Since early detection of tardive dyskinesia is important, patients should be monitored on an ongoing basis. It 
has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome. If this or any other presentation of the syndrome is observed, the clinician should consider 
possible discontinuation of antipsychotic medication (see WARNINGS section). THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Hepatic Effects Elevations of serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase, usually 
transient, have been infrequently observed in some patients. No clinically confirmed cases of jaundice attributable to thiothixene have been reported. Hematologic Effects As is true with certain other
psychotropic drugs, leukopenia and leukocytosis, which are usually transient, can occur occasionally with thiothixene. Other antipsychotic drugs have been associated with agranulocytosis, 
eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. Allergic Reactions Rash, pruritus, urticaria, photosensitivity and rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with thiothixene. 
Undue exposure to sunlight should be avoided. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Although not experienced with thiothixene, exfoliative dermatitis and contact dermatitis (in nursing personnel) have been 
reported with certain phenothiazines. Endocrine/Reproductive Hyperprolactinemia 3 , lactation, menstrual irregularities, moderate breast enlargement and amenorrhea have occurred in a small percentage 
of females receiving thiothixene. If persistent, this may necessitate a reduction in dosage or the discontinuation of therapy. Phenothiazines have been associated with false positive pregnancy tests, 
gynecomastia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and glycosuria. Autonomic Effects Dry mouth, blurred vision, nasal congestion, constipation, increased sweating, increased salivation and impotence have 
occurred infrequently with thiothixene therapy. Phenothiazines have been associated with miosis, mydriasis, and adynamic ileus. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Other Adverse Reactions Hyperpyrexia, 
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in appetite and weight, weakness or fatigue, polydipsia, and peripheral edema. Although not reported with thiothixene, evidence indicates there is a 
relationship between phenothiazine therapy and the occurrence of a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Please refer to the text regarding NMS in the 
WARNINGS section. NOTE : Sudden deaths have occasionally been reported in patients who have received certain phenothiazine derivatives. In some cases the cause of death was apparently cardiac arrest 
or asphyxia due to failure of the cough reflex. In others, the cause could not be determined nor could it be established that death was due to phenothiazine administration. THIOTHIXENE: 
adverse_reactions: To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch .

The FDAHandler has indicated that the FDA label for THIOTHIXENE does not contain information regarding an increased or decreased risk of aplastic anemia associated with its use. Therefore, it is not 
possible to determine from the FDA label data whether THIOTHIXENE has any effect on the risk of aplastic anemia.
