CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: All-Cause Mortality  Mortality Imbalance and Lower Cure 
Rates in Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia  Anaphylaxis [Warning and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Hepatic Adverse Effects [Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Pancreatitis [Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] The most 
common adverse reactions (incidence >5%) are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, and increased SGPT. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex at 1-800-706-5575

rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, 2514
patients were treated with tigecycline for injection. Tigecycline for injection was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of patients compared to 6% for all comparators. Table 1 shows the 
incidence of adverse reactions through test of cure reported in ≥2% of patients in these trials. Table 1. TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions Through Test of Cure

of patients receiving comparator drugs. In a pooled analysis of these trials, based on a random effects model by trial weight, an adjusted risk difference of all-cause mortality was 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 
1.2) between tigecycline for injection and comparator-treated patients (see Table 2). The cause of the imbalance has not been established. Generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, 
complications of infection or underlying co-morbidities. Table 2. TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: Patients with Outcome of Death by Infection Type Tigecycline for Injection Comparator Risk Difference*

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: In patients treated for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), nausea incidence was 24% for tigecycline for injection and 8% for levofloxacin; vomiting
incidence was 16% for tigecycline for injection and 6% for levofloxacin. Discontinuation from tigecycline for injection was most frequently associated with nausea (1%) and vomiting (1%). For 
comparators, discontinuation was most frequently associated with nausea (<1%). TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: The following adverse reactions were reported (<2%) in patients receiving tigecycline for
injection in clinical studies: Body as a Whole : injection site inflammation, injection site pain, injection site reaction, septic shock, allergic reaction, chills, injection site edema, injection

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and 
electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.10 Sepsis/Septic Shock in 
Patients With Intestinal Perforation Monotherapy with tigecycline should be avoided in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) secondary to clinically apparent intestinal 
perforation. In cIAI studies (n=1642), 6 patients treated with tigecycline for injection and 2 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin presented with intestinal perforations and developed 
sepsis/septic shock. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: The 6 patients treated with tigecycline for injection had higher APACHE II scores (median = 13) versus the 2 patients treated with 
imipenem/cilastatin (APACHE II scores = 4 and 6). Due to differences in baseline APACHE II scores between treatment groups and small overall numbers, the relationship of this outcome to treatment 
cannot be established. 5.11 Tetracycline-Class Adverse Effects Tigecycline for injection is structurally similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse effects. Such 
effects may include: photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic action (which has led to increased BUN, azotemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia). 5. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions:
12 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing tigecycline for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and 
increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS All-Cause Mortality: A meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials demonstrated an increase in all-cause mortality in 
tigecycline for injection-treated patients compared to controls with a risk difference of 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.2). The cause of this increase has not been established. An increase was also seen in a 
meta-analysis limited to the approved indications [0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2)]. The greatest difference in mortality was seen in tigecycline for injection-treated patients with ventilator-associated 
pneumonia. ( 5.1 , 5.2 ) Anaphylactic Reactions: have been reported with tigecycline for injection and may be life-threatening. Avoid use in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracyclines. ( 5.
TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 3 ) Hepatic Adverse Effects: have been reported with tigecycline for injection. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during tigecycline for injection 
therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline therapy. ( 5.4 ) Pancreatitis: including fatalities, has been reported 
with tigecycline for injection. If pancreatitis is suspected, then consider stopping tigecycline for injection. ( 5.5 ) Monitoring Blood Coagulation Parameters: Hypofibrinogenemia has been reported 
with tigecycline for injection. Monitor blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen, at baseline and regularly during treatment with tigecycline for injection. ( 5. TIGECYCLINE: 
warnings_and_cautions: 6 ) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia: The use of tigecycline for injection during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 
years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia. ( 5.7 ) Inhibition of Bone Growth: The use of tigecycline for injection during the second and third 
trimester of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. ( 5.8 ) Clostridium difficile associated Diarrhea (CDAD): evaluate if diarrhea 
occurs. (5.9 ) 5.1 All-Cause Mortality An increase in all-cause mortality has been observed in a meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials in tigecycline for injection-treated patients versus 
comparator-treated patients. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: In all 13 Phase 3 and 4 trials that included a comparator, death occurred in 4.0% (150/3788) of patients receiving tigecycline for 
injection and 3.0% (110/3646) of patients receiving comparator drugs. In a pooled analysis of these trials, based on a random effects model by trial weight, the adjusted risk difference of all-cause 
mortality was 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.2) between tigecycline for injection and comparator-treated patients. An analysis of mortality in all trials conducted for approved indications (cSSSI, cIAI, and 
CABP), including post-market trials showed an adjusted mortality rate of 2.5% (66/2640) for tigecycline and 1.8% (48/2628) for comparator, respectively.         
SOURCE:TIGECYCLINE label


CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: The adjusted risk difference for mortality stratified by trial weight was 0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2). The cause of this mortality difference has not been 
established. Generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, complications of infection or underlying co-morbidities. Tigecycline for injection should be reserved for use in situations when 
alternative treatments are not suitable  . 5.2 Mortality Imbalance and Lower Cure Rates in Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia A trial of patients with hospital acquired, including ventilator-associated, 
pneumonia failed to demonstrate the efficacy of tigecycline for injection. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: In this trial, patients were randomized to receive tigecycline for injection (100 mg 
initially, then 50 mg every 12 hours) or a comparator. In addition, patients were allowed to receive specified adjunctive therapies. The sub-group of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who 
received tigecycline for injection had lower cure rates (47.9% versus 70.1% for the clinically evaluable population). In this trial, greater mortality was seen in patients with ventilator-associated 
pneumonia who received tigecycline for injection (25/131 [19.1%] versus 15/122 [12.3%] in comparator-treated patients)  . Particularly high mortality was seen among tigecycline for injection-treated 
patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia at baseline (9/18 [50.0%] versus 1/13 [7. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 7%] in comparator-treated patients). 5.3 Anaphylactic 
Reactions Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including tigecycline for injection, and may be life-threatening. Tigecycline for injection is structurally 
similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and should be avoided in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. 5.4 Hepatic Adverse Effects Increases in 
total bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time and transaminases have been seen in patients treated with tigecycline. Isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure have been 
reported in patients being treated with tigecycline. Some of these patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Patients who develop abnormal liver 
function tests during tigecycline therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline therapy. Hepatic dysfunction may occur
after the drug has been discontinued. 5.5 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal cases, has occurred in association with tigecycline treatment. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be 
considered in patients taking tigecycline who develop clinical symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Cases have been reported in patients without known risk 
factors for pancreatitis. Patients usually improve after tigecycline discontinuation. Consideration should be given to the cessation of the treatment with tigecycline in cases suspected of having 
developed pancreatitis  . 5. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 6 Monitoring of Blood Coagulation Parameters Hypofibrinogenemia has been reported in patients treated with tigecycline for injection  .
Obtain baseline blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen, and continue to monitor regularly during treatment with tigecycline for injection. 5.7 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The
use of tigecycline for injection during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). 
This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of tetracyclines, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported. TIGECYCLINE: 
warnings_and_cautions: Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if tigecycline for injection is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy . 5.8 Inhibition of Bone Growth The 
use of tigecycline for injection during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. All tetracyclines 
form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This 
reaction was shown to be reversible when the tetracycline was discontinued. Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if tigecycline for injection is used during the second or third 
trimester of pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.

TIGECYCLINE can increase the risk of acute liver injury. This is supported by the response from FDAHandler, which indicates that hepatic adverse effects, including increases in total bilirubin 
concentration, prothrombin time, and transaminases, have been reported in patients treated with tigecycline. Additionally, isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure have 
been reported, although it is noted that some of these patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Monitoring for worsening hepatic function is recommended for patients who develop 
abnormal liver function tests during tigecycline therapy.
