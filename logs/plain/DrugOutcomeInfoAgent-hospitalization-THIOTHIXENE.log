CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage of thiothixene capsules should be individually adjusted depending on the chronicity and severity of the symptoms of 
schizophrenia. In general, small doses should be used initially and gradually increased to the optimal effective level, based on patient response. Some patients have been successfully maintained on 
once-a-day thiothixene capsules therapy. The use of thiothixene capsules in children under 12 years of age is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established. In milder 
conditions, an initial dose of 2 mg three times daily is recommended. If indicated, a subsequent increase to 15 mg/day total daily dose is often effective. In more severe conditions, an initial dose 
of 5 mg twice daily is recommended. The usual optimal dose is 20 mg to 30 mg daily. If indicated, an increase to 60 mg/day total daily dose is often effective. THIOTHIXENE: dosage_and_administration: 
Exceeding a total daily dose of 60 mg rarely increases the beneficial response.

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association 
with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene 2 . Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or 
blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify 
cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). 
Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. THIOTHIXENE: 
warnings: The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical 
monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens 
for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be 
carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Pregnancy Safe use of thiothixene during pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, this drug should be given to pregnant patients
only when, in the judgment of the physician, the expected benefits from the treatment exceed the possible risks to mother and fetus. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Non-teratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to 
antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, 
tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases 
neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Thiothixene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
Animal reproduction studies and clinical experience to date have not demonstrated any teratogenic effects. In the animal reproduction studies with thiothixene, there was some decrease in conception 
rate and litter size, and an increase in resorption rate in rats and rabbits. Similar findings have been reported with other psychotropic agents. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: After repeated oral 
administration of thiothixene to rats (5 to 15 mg/kg/day), rabbits (3 to 50 mg/kg/day), and monkeys (1 to 3 mg/kg/day) before and during gestation, no teratogenic effects were seen. Usage in Children 
The use of thiothixene in children under 12 years of age is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established. As is true with many CNS drugs, thiothixene may impair the 
mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, 
the patient should be cautioned accordingly. As in the case of other CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving thiothixene should be cautioned about the possible additive effects (which may include 
hypotension) with CNS depressants and with alcohol.

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the 
prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been 
reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of 
antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; 
the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect In clinical trial and/or 
postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include 
preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia 
should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of thiothixene should be considered at the first sign of a clinically 
significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection 
and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue thiothixene and have their 
WBC followed until recovery. Information for Patients Given the likelihood that some patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in 
whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical 
circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided. Drug Interactions Hepatic microsomal enzyme inducing agents, such as carbamazepine, were found to significantly 
increase the clearance of thiothixene. Patients receiving these drugs should be observed for signs of reduced thiothixene effectiveness 4,5 . THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Due to a possible additive 
effect with hypotensive agents, patients receiving these drugs should be observed closely for signs of excessive hypotension when thiothixene is added to their drug regimen 6 .

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: warnings: WARNINGS Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are 
at an increased risk of death. Thiothixene is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see BOXED WARNING ). Tardive Dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome 
consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene 1 . Although the prevalence of the syndrome 
appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely
to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Both the risk of developing the syndrome and the 
likelihood that it will become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, 
the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the 
syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the 
syndrome and thereby may possibly mask the underlying disease process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, 
antipsychotics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be 
reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are
not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The 
need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, 
some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome. (For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to “ Information
for Patients ” in the PRECAUTIONS section, and to the ADVERSE REACTIONS section.

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: boxed_warning: WARNING Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs 
are at an increased risk of death. Analyses of seventeen placebo-controlled trials (modal duration of 10 weeks), largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in 
drug-treated patients of between 1.6 to 1.7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was 
about 4.5%, compared to a rate of about 2.6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e.g., heart failure, sudden death)
or infectious (e.g., pneumonia) in nature. THIOTHIXENE: boxed_warning: Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may 
increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic(s) of the patients is
not clear. Thiothixene is not approved for the treatment of patients with dementia-related psychosis (see WARNINGS ).

Given this information, while the label does not explicitly state an increased risk of hospitalization, the serious side effects and increased risk of death in certain populations imply that there may
be scenarios where thiothixene use could lead to hospitalization. However, without specific data on the frequency of hospitalization as a side effect, we cannot conclusively say that thiothixene 
increases the risk of hospitalization in general. The risk may be more pronounced in certain populations, such as elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.

The FDA label for THIOTHIXENE does not provide specific information on the risk of hospitalization associated with its use. While there are serious side effects mentioned that could potentially lead 
to hospitalization, such as an increased risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis and warnings about potentially fatal side effects like Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), 
there is no explicit data on the frequency or risk of hospitalization as a side effect. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine whether THIOTHIXENE increases or decreases the risk of 
hospitalization based on the available FDA label information.
