increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin, closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs that Can Increase the Risk

consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin. Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin. 7.5 Botanical (Herbal) 
Products and Foods More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals. Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or 
pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may 
vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g. WARFARIN: 
drug_interactions: garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of 
warfarin sodium. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium (e.g., co-enzyme Q 10 , St. John’s wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with warfarin sodium 
through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John’s wort). The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium. Advise patients taking 
warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large 
amounts of green leafy vegetables.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: spl_medguide: MEDICATION GUIDE Dispense with Medication Guide available at: www.tevausa.com/medguides Warfarin (war' far in) Sodium (soe' dee um) Tablets What is the most important 
information I should know about warfarin sodium tablets? Warfarin sodium tablets can cause bleeding which can be serious and sometimes lead to death. This is because warfarin sodium tablets are a 
blood thinner medicine that lowers the chance of blood clots forming in your body. WARFARIN: spl_medguide: You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take warfarin sodium tablets and: are 65 years 
of age or older have a history of stomach or intestinal bleeding have high blood pressure (hypertension) have a history of stroke, or “mini-stroke” (transient ischemic attack or TIA) have serious 
heart disease have a low blood count or cancer have had trauma, such as an accident or surgery have kidney problems take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including: a medicine that
contains heparin other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) take warfarin sodium for a long time. Warfarin sodium is the active ingredient in 
warfarin sodium tablets. Tell your healthcare provider if you take any of these medicines. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above. WARFARIN: 
spl_medguide: Many other medicines can interact with warfarin sodium tablets and affect the dose you need or increase warfarin sodium tablets side effects. Do not change or stop any of your medicines 
or start any new medicines before you talk to your healthcare provider. Do not take other medicines that contain warfarin sodium while taking warfarin sodium tablets. Get your regular blood test to 
check for your response to warfarin sodium tablets. This blood test is called an INR test. The INR test checks to see how fast your blood clots. Your healthcare provider will decide what INR numbers

CONTENT: WARFARIN: drug_interactions: 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, antibiotics, antifungals, botanical (herbal) products, and inhibitors and inducers of 
CYP2C9, 1A2, or 3A4. ( 7 ) Consult labeling of all concurrently used drugs for complete information about interactions with warfarin sodium or increased risks for bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 General 
Information Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired
hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic 
mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: It is important to note that some
drugs may interact by more than one mechanism. More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, 
including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [ see Boxed Warning ]. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information 
about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding. 7.2 CYP450 Interactions CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 
1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 
3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin. Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease
INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin. Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2 ; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. 
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, 
stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications.

ANSWER: Yes, WARFARIN can increase the risk of bleeding, which can be serious and sometimes lead to death. This is because WARFARIN is a blood thinner medicine that lowers the chance of blood clots 
forming in the body. The medication guide for WARFARIN explicitly states that it can cause bleeding, and there are specific warnings about the bleeding risk, including a boxed warning indicating that 
WARFARIN sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Regular monitoring of INR is required in all treated patients to minimize the risk of bleeding. The risk of bleeding is higher in certain 
populations, such as those who are older, have a history of bleeding, have high blood pressure, or take other medicines that increase the risk of bleeding.

        Question: Does WARFARIN increase or decrease the risk of bleeding?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether WARFARIN increases the risk of bleeding.
2. FDAHandler confirmed that WARFARIN can increase the risk of bleeding, which can be serious and sometimes lead to death. The medication guide for WARFARIN states that it can cause bleeding, and 
there are specific warnings about the bleeding risk, including a boxed warning indicating that WARFARIN sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Regular monitoring of INR is required to minimize the 
risk of bleeding, and certain populations are at higher risk.
        -----
        Final answer: WARFARIN increases the risk of bleeding, which can be serious and sometimes lead to death.

WARFARIN increases the risk of bleeding, which can be serious and sometimes lead to death. This is based on the medication guide for WARFARIN, which states that it can cause bleeding. There are 
specific warnings about the bleeding risk, including a boxed warning indicating that WARFARIN sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Regular monitoring of INR is required to minimize the risk of 
bleeding, and certain populations are at higher risk.
