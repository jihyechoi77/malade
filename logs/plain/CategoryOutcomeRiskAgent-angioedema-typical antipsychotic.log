                Passages:
                1. Drug HALOPERIDOL: The FDAHandler has responded with DO-NOT-KNOW to both inquiries about whether HALOPERIDOL increases or decreases the risk of angioedema. This indicates that the 
FDA label for HALOPERIDOL does not specify any information regarding the drug's effect on the risk of angioedema. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the FDA label data whether HALOPERIDOL
has an impact on the risk of developing angioedema.

 DO-NOT-KNOW

The justification for this conclusion is that the FDA label for HALOPERIDOL, as per the responses from FDAHandler, does not contain information on the drug's effect on angioedema risk. Without this 
information, we cannot ascertain if HALOPERIDOL has any effect on the incidence of angioedema.
2. Drug THIOTHIXENE: I have attempted to retrieve information regarding the effect of thiothixene on the risk of angioedema from the FDAHandler multiple times, but have not received any relevant 
information. It appears that the FDA label for thiothixene does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of angioedema. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question 
based on FDA label data.

 DO-NOT-KNOW

The justification for this answer is that the FDAHandler has responded with DO-NOT-KNOW to inquiries about both an increase and a decrease in the risk of angioedema associated with thiothixene, 
indicating that the FDA label does not contain this information.
3. Drug PIMOZIDE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for PIMOZIDE does not mention angioedema as a known risk or observed side effect, nor does it indicate that PIMOZIDE decreases the risk of angioedema. Therefore, based on the available 
FDA label data, it is not possible to determine whether PIMOZIDE increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.

                Does the typical antipsychotic category of drugs increase the risk of
                angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for HALOPERIDOL does not specify any information regarding the drug's effect on the risk of angioedema, leading to a DO-NOT-KNOW response.
2. The FDA label for THIOTHIXENE also does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of angioedema, resulting in a DO-NOT-KNOW response.
3. The FDA label for PIMOZIDE does not mention angioedema as a known risk or observed side effect, nor does it indicate that PIMOZIDE decreases the risk of angioedema, leading to a DO-NOT-KNOW 
response.
4. Since all three drugs in the typical antipsychotic category provided do not have information on their labels regarding the effect on angioedema risk, it is not possible to determine a clear effect 
of the typical antipsychotic category on the risk of angioedema.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the typical antipsychotic category of drugs on the risk of angioedema based on the available information from the FDA labels.
