        -----
        
CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Captopril : Reported incidences are based on clinical trials involving approximately 7000 patients. Renal : About one of 100 patients developed
proteinuria (see WARNINGS ). Each of the following has been reported in approximately 1 to 2 of 1000 patients and are of uncertain relationship to drug use: renal insufficiency, renal failure, 
nephrotic syndrome, polyuria, oliguria, and urinary frequency. Hematologic : Neutropenia/agranulocytosis has occurred (see WARNINGS ). Cases of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been 
reported. Dermatologic : Rash, often with pruritus, and sometimes with fever, arthralgia, and eosinophilia, occurred in about 4 to 7 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients, usually 
during the first four weeks of therapy. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: It is usually maculopapular, and rarely urticarial. The rash is usually mild and disappears within a few days of dosage reduction,
short-term treatment with an antihistaminic agent, and/or discontinuing therapy; remission may occur even if captopril is continued. Pruritus, without rash, occurs in about 2 of 100 patients. Between 
7 and 10 percent of patients with skin rash have shown eosinophilia and/or positive ANA titers. A reversible associated pemphigoid-like lesion, and photosensitivity, have also been reported. Flushing 
or pallor has been reported in 2 to 5 of 1000 patients. Cardiovascular : Hypotension may occur; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (Drug Interactions) for discussion of hypotension with captopril therapy. 
Tachycardia, chest pain, and palpitations have each been observed in approximately 1 of 100 patients. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, Raynaudâ€™s syndrome, and 
congestive heart failure have each occurred in 2 to 3 of 1000 patients. Dysgeusia : Approximately 2 to 4 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients developed a diminution or loss of taste 
perception. Taste impairment is reversible and usually self-limited (2 to 3 months) even with continued drug administration. Weight loss may be associated with the loss of taste. Angioedema : 
Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in approximately one in 1000 patients. Angioedema involving the upper airways has caused
fatal airway obstruction. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ). CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Cough : Cough has been
reported in 0.5 to 2% of patients treated with captopril in clinical trials (see PRECAUTIONS: General: Captopril: Cough ). The following have been reported in about 0.5 to 2 percent of patients but 
did not appear at increased frequency compared to placebo or other treatments used in controlled trials: gastric irritation, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, 
aphthous ulcers, peptic ulcer, dizziness, headache, malaise, fatigue, insomnia, dry mouth, dyspnea, alopecia, paresthesias. Other clinical adverse effects reported since the drug was marketed are 
listed below by body system. In this setting, an incidence or causal relationship cannot be accurately determined. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Body as a Whole : Anaphylactoid reactions (see 
WARNINGS: Captopril: Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis ). General : asthenia, gynecomastia. Cardiovascular : cardiac arrest, cerebrovascular 
accident/insufficiency, rhythm disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, syncope. Dermatologic : bullous pemphigus, erythema multiforme (including Stevens-Johnson syndrome), exfoliative dermatitis. 
Gastrointestinal : pancreatitis, glossitis, dyspepsia. Hematologic : anemia, including aplastic and hemolytic. Hepatobiliary : jaundice, hepatitis, including rare cases of necrosis, cholestasis. 
Metabolic : symptomatic hyponatremia. Musculoskeletal : myalgia, myasthenia. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Nervous/Psychiatric : ataxia, confusion, depression, nervousness, somnolence. Respiratory : 
bronchospasm, eosinophilic pneumonitis, rhinitis. Special Senses : blurred vision. Urogenital : impotence. As with other ACE inhibitors, a syndrome has been reported which may include: fever, myalgia,
arthralgia, interstitial nephritis, vasculitis, rash or other dermatologic manifestations, eosinophilia and an elevated ESR. Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality: See WARNINGS: Captopril: 
Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality . Hydrochlorothiazide : Gastrointestinal System : anorexia, gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea, constipation, jaundice (intrahepatic 
cholestatic jaundice), pancreatitis, and sialadenitis.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE Captopril : Correction of hypotension would be of primary concern. Volume expansion with an intravenous infusion of normal saline is the treatment of choice 
for restoration of blood pressure. While captopril may be removed from the adult circulation by hemodialysis, there is inadequate data concerning the effectiveness of hemodialysis for removing it from
the circulation of neonates or children. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective for removing captopril; there is no information concerning exchange transfusion for removing captopril from the general 
circulation. Hydrochlorothiazide : In addition to the expected diuresis, overdosage of thiazides may produce varying degrees of lethargy which may progress to coma within a few hours, with minimal 
depression of respiration and cardiovascular function and without evidence of serum electrolyte changes or dehydration. The mechanism of thiazide-induced CNS depression is unknown. Gastrointestinal 
irritation and hypermotility may occur. CAPTOPRIL: overdosage: Transitory increase in BUN has been reported, and serum electrolyte changes may occur, especially in patients with impaired renal 
function. In addition to gastric lavage and supportive therapy for stupor or coma, symptomatic treatment of gastrointestinal effects may be needed. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed 
by hemodialysis has not been clearly established. Measures as required to maintain hydration, electrolyte balance, respiration, and cardiovascular and renal function should be instituted.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: pregnancy: Pregnancy Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of second- and third-trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors, and they should also be 
told that these consequences do not appear to have resulted from intrauterine ACE-inhibitor exposure that has been limited to the first trimester. These patients should be asked to report pregnancies 
to their physicians as soon as possible.         
SOURCE:CAPTOPRIL label


CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Positive test results were obtained only in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using 
concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide from 43 to 1300 mcg/mL, and in the Aspergillus nidulans non-disjunction assay at an unspecified concentration. Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the 
fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. 
Animal Toxicology Captopril : Chronic oral toxicity studies were conducted in rats (2 years), dogs (47 weeks; 1 year), mice (2 years), and monkeys (1 year). Significant drug-related toxicity included 
effects on hematopoiesis, renal toxicity, erosion/ulceration of the stomach, and variation of retinal blood vessels. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Reductions in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit values were seen
in mice, rats, and monkeys at doses 50 to 150 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow suppression occurred in dogs at doses 8 to 30 times
MRHD. The reductions in hemoglobin and hematocrit values in rats and mice were only significant at 1 year and returned to normal with continued dosing by the end of the study. Marked anemia was seen 
at all dose levels (8 to 30 times MRHD) in dogs, whereas moderate to marked leukopenia was noted only at 15 and 30 times MRHD and thrombocytopenia at 30 times MRHD. The anemia could be reversed upon 
discontinuation of dosing. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Bone marrow suppression occurred to a varying degree, being associated only with dogs that died or were sacrificed in a moribund condition in the 1 
year study. However, in the 47-week study at a dose 30 times MRHD, bone marrow suppression was found to be reversible upon continued drug administration. Captopril caused hyperplasia of the 
juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys at doses 7 to 200 times the MRHD in rats and mice, at 20 to 60 times MRHD in monkeys, and at 30 times the MRHD in dogs. Gastric erosions/ulcerations were 
increased in incidence at 20 and 200 times MRHD in male rats and at 30 and 65 times MRHD in dogs and monkeys, respectively. Rabbits developed gastric and intestinal ulcers when given oral doses 
approximately 30 times MRHD for only five to seven days. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: In the two-year rat study, irreversible and progressive variations in the caliber of retinal vessels (focal 
sacculations and constrictions) occurred at all dose levels (7 to 200 times MRHD) in a dose-related fashion. The effect was first observed in the 88 th week of dosing, with a progressively increased 
incidence thereafter, even after cessation of dosing. Pregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D (second and third trimesters): See WARNINGS: Captopril: Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality . 
Pregnancy: Nonteratogenic Effects: Hydrochlorothiazide : Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood. The use of thiazides in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be
weighed against possible hazards to the fetus. These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice, thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions which have occurred in the adult. CAPTOPRIL: 
precautions: Nursing Mothers Both captopril and hydrochlorothiazide are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from both drugs, a decision 
should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy taking into account the importance of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide to the mother. (See PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use. ) 
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. There is limited experience reported in the literature with the use of captopril in the pediatric population; 
dosage, on a weight basis, was generally reported to be comparable to or less than that used in adults. Infants, especially newborns, may be more susceptible to the adverse hemodynamic effects of 
captopril. Excessive, prolonged and un-predictable decreases in blood pressure and associated complications, including oliguria and seizures, have been reported.

The FDA label for CAPTOPRIL does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. While the label lists various gastrointestinal effects, 
including peptic ulcer, it does not provide a direct correlation with the risk of hospitalization due to gastrointestinal ulcers. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the effect 
of CAPTOPRIL on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization based on the FDA label data.
