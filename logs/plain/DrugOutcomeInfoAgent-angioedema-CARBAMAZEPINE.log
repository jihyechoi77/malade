CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 Allele Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of 
developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher 
frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity. Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. 
Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including 
Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, averaging 2 to 4%, but higher in some groups. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: HLA-B*1502 is present in <1% of the population in Japan and Korea.
HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans). Prior to initiating carbamazepine extended-release capsules 
therapy, testing for HLA-B*1502 should be performed in patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA-B*1502 may be present. In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the 
prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic 
ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Tested patients who are found to be negative for the allele are thought to have a low risk of SJS/TEN (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS/Laboratory Tests ). Over 90% of 
carbamazepine treated patients who will experience SJS/TEN have this reaction within the first few months of treatment. This information may be taken into consideration in determining the need for 
screening of genetically at-risk patients currently on carbamazepine extended-release capsules. The HLA-B*1502 allele has not been found to predict risk of less severe adverse cutaneous reactions from
carbamazepine, such as maculopapular eruption [MPE] or to predict Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may 
be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Chinese ancestry taking other anti-epileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to 
avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable. Patients should be made aware that carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules contain carbamazepine and should not be used in combination with any other medications containing carbamazepine. Hypersensitivity Reactions and HLA-A*3101 Allele 
Retrospective case-control studies in patients of European, Korean, and Japanese ancestry have found a moderate association between the risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions and the presence 
of HLA-A*3101, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-A gene, in patients using carbamazepine. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: These hypersensitivity reactions include SJS/TEN, maculopapular eruptions, and 
Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (see DRESS/Multiorgan hypersensitivity below). HLA-A*3101 is expected to be carried by more than 15% of patients of Japanese, Native American, 
Southern Indian (e.g., Tamil Nadu) and some Arabic ancestry; up to about 10% in patients of Han Chinese, Korean, European, Latin American and other Indian ancestry; and up to about 5% in 
African-Americans and patients of Thai, Taiwanese, and Chinese (Hong Kong) ancestry. The risks and benefits of carbamazepine therapy should be weighed before considering carbamazepine in patients 
known to be positive for HLA-A*3101. General Information on HLA Genotyping and Hypersensitivity Application of HLA genotyping as a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute 
for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Many HLA-B*1502-positive and HLA-A*3101-positive patients treated with carbamazepine will not develop SJS/TEN or 
other hypersensitivity reactions, and these reactions can still occur infrequently in HLA-B*1502-negative and HLA-A*3101-negative patients of any ethnicity. The role of other possible factors in the 
development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN and other hypersensitivity reactions, such as AED dose, compliance, concomitant medications, co-morbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have 
not been studied. Aplastic Anemia and Agranulocytosis Aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis have been reported in association with the use of carbamazepine. (See BOXED WARNING .) Patients with a history
of adverse hematologic reaction to any drug may be particularly at risk of bone marrow depression. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan 
Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, have occurred with carbamazepine. Some of these events have been fatal or 
life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and/or facial swelling in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, 
nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. This disorder is variable in its expression, and other 
organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy) may be present even though rash is not evident. If 
such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Carbamazepine should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms 
cannot be established. Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions to carbamazepine have been reported in patients who previously experienced this reaction to anticonvulsants including phenytoin, 
primidone, and phenobarbital. A history of hypersensitivity reactions should be obtained for patients and their immediate family members. If such history is present, benefits and risks should be 
carefully considered, and, if carbamazepine is initiated, the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity should be carefully monitored. In patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity reactions to 
carbamazepine, approximately 25 to 30% may experience hypersensitivity reactions with oxcarbazepine (Trileptal Â® ). CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Anaphylaxis and Angioedema Rare cases of anaphylaxis and 
angioedema involving the larynx, glottis, lips, and eyelids have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of carbamazepine. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can 
be fatal. If a patient develops any of these reactions after treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative treatment started. These 
patients should not be rechallenged with the drug. Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased 
seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises,
this should be done gradually. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. Suicidal 
Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including carbamazepine extended-release capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any 
indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or 
behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the 
risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing 
an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after 
starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or 
behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Medication Guide Carbamazepine Extended-Release Capsules (karâ ba mazâ e peen) Medication Guide available at https://www.apotex.com/products/us/mg.asp Read this 
Medication Guide before you start taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to 
your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. What is the most important information I should know about carbamazepine extended-release capsules? Do not stop taking carbamazepine
extended-release capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping carbamazepine extended-release capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Carbamazepine extended-release 
capsules can cause serious side effects, including: 1. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may cause rare but serious rashes that may lead to death. CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: These serious skin
reactions are more likely to happen within the first four months of carbamazepine extended-release capsules treatment but may occur at later times. These reactions can happen in anyone, but are more 
likely in people of Asian descent. If you are of Asian descent you may need a genetic blood test before you take carbamazepine extended-release capsules to see if you are at a higher risk for serious 
skin reactions with this medicine. Symptoms may include: skin rash hives sores in your mouth blistering or peeling of the skin 2. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules can also cause other types of 
allergic reactions or serious problems that may affect organs and other parts of your body such as your liver or blood cells. You may or may not have a rash when you get these types of reactions. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms: swelling of your face, eyes, lips, or tongue trouble swallowing or breathing frequent fevers or
fevers that do not go away frequent infections or an infection that does not go away unusual bruising or bleeding red or purple spots on your body severe fatigue or weakness unexpected muscle pain 
that does not go away swollen glands that do not go away yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes loss of appetite (anorexia) that does not go away nausea or vomiting that does not go away 
These symptoms may be the first signs of a serious reaction. A healthcare provider should examine you to decide if you should continue taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. 3. Like other 
antiepileptic drugs, carbamazepine extended-release capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Call your healthcare 
provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide or dying attempt to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse 
anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) new or worse irritability acting aggressive, being angry, or violent acting on dangerous impulses an extreme increase in 
activity and talking (mania) other unusual changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in 
mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried 
about symptoms. Do not stop carbamazepine extended-release capsules without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping carbamazepine extended-release capsules suddenly can cause serious 
problems. CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other
causes. What is carbamazepine extended-release capsule? Carbamazepine extended-release capsule is a medicine used to treat: certain types of seizures (partial, tonic-clonic, mixed) certain types of 
nerve pain (trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia). Carbamazepine extended-release capsule is not a regular pain medicine and should not be used for aches or pains. Who should not take 
carbamazepine extended-release capsules? Do not take carbamazepine extended-release capsules if you: have a history of bone marrow depression are allergic to carbamazepine or any of the ingredients in
carbamazepine extended-release capsules. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in carbamazepine extended-release capsules.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: warnings: WARNINGS General Lisinopril Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions: Presumably because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of 
eicosanoids and polypeptides, including endogenous bradykinin, patients receiving ACE inhibitors (including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets) may be subject to a variety of adverse 
reactions, some of them serious. Head and Neck Angioedema: Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, tongue, glottis and/or larynx has been reported rarely in patients treated with angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors, including lisinopril. This may occur at any time during treatment. ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in non-Black 
patients. LISINOPRIL: warnings: In such cases lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and 
sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred. Even in those instances where swelling of only the tongue is involved, without respiratory distress, patients may require prolonged observation
since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient. Very rarely, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema. Patients 
with involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction, especially those with a history of airway surgery. Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or 
larynx, likely to cause airway obstruction, subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1:1000 (0.3 mL to 0. LISINOPRIL: warnings: 5 mL) and/or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly 
provided (See ADVERSE REACTIONS . ) Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE-inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor (see also 
INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) 
therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema (see PRECAUTIONS ). Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. 
These patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. LISINOPRIL: 
warnings: The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be 
included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization: Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment 
with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily 
withheld, but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure: Sudden and potentially life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in some
patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. In such patients, dialysis must be stopped immediately, and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions 
must be initiated. LISINOPRIL: warnings: Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations. In these patients, consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis 
membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. 
Hypotension and Related Effects Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in uncomplicated hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of lisinopril use in salt/volume-depleted persons such as 
those treated vigorously with diuretics or patients on dialysis. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS .) Syncope has been reported in 0.8 percent of patients receiving lisinopril 
and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. In patients with hypertension receiving lisinopril alone, the incidence of syncope was 0.1 percent.

CONTENT: LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline
in GFR, end state renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group. In general, avoid combined use of RAS 
inhibitors. Monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS. Do not coadminister aliskiren with 
lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with PRINZIDE in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min). Other Agents: Lisinopril has been used 
concomitantly with nitrates and/or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: No meaningful clinically important pharmacokinetic 
interactions occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol, digoxin, or hydrochlorothiazide. The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril. 
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Use of lisinopril with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, eplerenone, 
triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is 
indicated, because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. Lithium: Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving 
lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and
the ACE inhibitor. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium. Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial 
flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including lisinopril and
hydrochlorothiazide tablets. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors: Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) 
therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. (see WARNINGS ) Neprilysin Inhibitors: Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema. LISINOPRIL: 
drug_interactions: (see WARNINGS ) Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics. Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics - potentiation of 
orthostatic hypotension may occur. Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) - dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required. Other antihypertensive drugs - additive effect or 
potentiation. Cholestyramine and colestipol resins - Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins. Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol 
resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Corticosteroids, ACTH - intensified electrolyte depletion, 
particularly hypokalemia. Pressor amines (e.g. LISINOPRIL: drug_interactions: norepinephrine) - possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use. Skeletal muscle 
relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) - possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant. Lithium - should not generally be given with diuretics. Diuretic agents reduce the renal 
clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. 
Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatoryDrugs - In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, 
potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: Other Cardiovascular Agents Enalapril maleate has been used concomitantly with beta adrenergic-blocking agents, methyldopa, nitrates, calcium-blocking 
agents, hydralazine, prazosin and digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions. Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Enalapril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type
diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum 
potassium. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. 
Potassium-sparing agents should generally not be used in patients with heart failure receiving enalapril maleate. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: Lithium Lithium toxicity has been reported in 
patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. A few cases of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant 
enalapril maleate and lithium and were reversible upon discontinuation of both drugs. It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if enalapril is administered concomitantly 
with lithium. Gold Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium 
aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including enalapril maleate. mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) Inhibitors Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR 
inhibitor (e.g. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: drug_interactions: temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ).

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication 
Guide before taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of 
liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Patients should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, they must report any occurrence immediately to
their physicians. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use. CARBAMAZEPINE: 
information_for_patients: Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In the event a skin reaction should 
occur while taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS ). Patients should be advised that anaphylactic reactions and 
angioedema may occur during treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients to immediately report signs and symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the 
face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their healthcare provider. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: 
Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including carbamazepine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert 
for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern 
should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use 
of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products. Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive 
sedative effect. Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of 
antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 (see Warnings-Usage in Pregnancy ). If necessary, the carbamazepine extended-release capsules can
be opened and the contents sprinkled over food, such as a teaspoon of applesauce or other similar food products. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules or their contents should not be crushed or 
chewed. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use of any other prescription or non-prescription 
medication or herbal products. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide, and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide prior 
to taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: See FDA approved Medication Guide.

anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can involve the larynx, glottis, lips, and eyelids. Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema can be fatal. If a patient develops any of these reactions after 
treatment with carbamazepine, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative treatment started. These patients should not be rechallenged with the drug.

        Question: Does CARBAMAZEPINE increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if CARBAMAZEPINE increases the risk of angioedema.
2. FDAHandler responded that CARBAMAZEPINE has been reported to cause rare cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema, which can be fatal if involving the laryngeal edema. Patients who develop such reactions
should discontinue the drug and not be rechallenged with it.
        -----
        Final answer: CARBAMAZEPINE increases the risk of angioedema, although such cases are rare.

CARBAMAZEPINE increases the risk of angioedema, although such cases are rare. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which states that CARBAMAZEPINE has been reported to cause rare 
cases of anaphylaxis and angioedema, including potentially fatal laryngeal edema. Patients who develop such reactions should discontinue the drug and not be rechallenged with it.
