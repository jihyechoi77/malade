        -----
        
CONTENT: BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger 
subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate 
deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or 
without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased 
incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be 
monitored. BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage 
adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
section). The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given 
concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM 
treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Bactrim Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Bactrim DS Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.
BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher 
and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics ).         
SOURCE:BACTRIM label


CONTENT: BACTRIM: precautions: Electrolyte Abnormalities Hyperkalemia : High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of 
serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders
of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Hyponatremia : 
Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving BACTRIM, particularly for the treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is 
necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications. Crystalluria : During treatment, ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output to prevent crystalluria. BACTRIM: 
precautions: Patients who are “slow acetylators” may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including 
Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and 
trimethoprim) tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken 
exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will 
develop resistance and will not be treatable by Bactrim (sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim) tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. BACTRIM: precautions: Patients should be instructed to 
maintain an adequate fluid intake in order to prevent crystalluria and stone formation. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. 
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the 
last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests Complete blood counts and clinical chemistry testing should be done 
frequently in patients receiving BACTRIM. Perform urinalyses with careful microscopic examination and renal function tests during therapy, particularly for those patients with impaired renal function.
Discontinue BACTRIM if a significant electrolyte abnormality, renal insufficiency or reduction in the count of any formed blood element is noted. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions 
Potential for BACTRIM to Affect Other Drugs Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM with drugs
that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2. Table 1: Drug Interactions with BACTRIM Drug(s) Recommendation Comments Diuretics Avoid concurrent use In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain
diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Warfarin Monitor prothrombin time and INR It has been reported that BACTRIM may prolong the 
prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). BACTRIM: drug_interactions: This interaction should be kept in mind when BACTRIM is given to patients 
already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed. Phenytoin Monitor serum phenytoin levels BACTRIM may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin (a CYP2C9 substrate). 
BACTRIM, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one 
should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect. Methotrexate Avoid concurrent use Sulfonamides can also displace methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal 
transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: teratogenic_effects: Teratogenic Effects Human Data While there are no large prospective, well controlled studies in pregnant women and their babies, some retrospective epidemiologic
studies suggest an association between first trimester exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, 
cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. These studies, however, were limited by the small number of exposed cases and the lack of adjustment for multiple 
statistical comparisons and confounders. These studies are further limited by recall, selection, and information biases, and by limited generalizability of their findings. Lastly, outcome measures 
varied between studies, limiting cross-study comparisons. Alternatively, other epidemiologic studies did not detect statistically significant associations between sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim 
exposure and specific malformations. BACTRIM: precautions: Animal Data In rats, oral doses of either 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly
as cleft palates. These doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mg/kg of 
sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of 
trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose based on body surface area. Nonteratogenic Effects See CONTRAINDICATIONS section. Nursing Mothers Levels of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in breast 
milk are approximately 2–5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. BACTRIM: precautions: Caution should be exercised when BACTRIM is administered to a nursing woman, 
especially when breastfeeding jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus. Pediatric Use BACTRIM is contraindicated for 
infants younger than 2 months of age (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and 
over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions 
exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. BACTRIM: precautions: Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see
