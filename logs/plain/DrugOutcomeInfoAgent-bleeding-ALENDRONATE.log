CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: dosage_and_administration: 3 Important Administration Instructions Instruct patients to do the following to assure adequate drug absorption and to decrease the risk of esophageal
adverse reactions: i. Take BINOSTO upon arising for the day and at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day. Patients should not swallow the undissolved effervescent 
tablet, should not chew the effervescent tablet or allow the effervescent tablet to dissolve in their mouths because of the risk for oropharyngeal irritation . Dissolve the effervescent tablet in 4 
ounces room temperature plain water only (not mineral water or flavored water). ii. Wait at least 5 minutes after the effervescence stops and then stir the buffered solution for approximately 10 
seconds and ingest. iii. Avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after taking BINOSTO and until after their first food of the day. iv. ALENDRONATE: dosage_and_administration: Do not take BINOSTO at 
bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse reactions  . 2.4 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation 
Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate  . Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing 
home-bound, or chronically ill) may need vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 
25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered. 2.5 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses If the once-weekly dose is missed, instruct patients to take one dose on the morning after they remember. 
ALENDRONATE: dosage_and_administration: They should not take 2 doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and 
duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials  . 5.2 Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia must be 
corrected before initiating therapy with BINOSTO . Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, 
serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with BINOSTO. Presumably due to the effects of BINOSTO on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum 
calcium and phosphate may occur. Patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. 5.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts
on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, 
bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and
specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately 
reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass 
that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or 
kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of 
bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the 
spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90, the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. ALENDRONATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes.
Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women 
produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as 
deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy 
with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) 
reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to 
those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone 
resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. 
ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by 
approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased 
osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year 
studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of 
bone turnover reached a new steady state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone.

ANSWER: The provided extracts from the ALENDRONATE label do not directly address whether ALENDRONATE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding. The extracts discuss the importance of proper 
administration to decrease the risk of esophageal adverse reactions, the need to correct hypocalcemia before initiating therapy, and the pharmacodynamics of ALENDRONATE, which include inhibiting the 
activity of osteoclasts and reducing bone resorption without a direct effect on bone formation. There is mention of esophageal adverse experiences, which can include bleeding, but this is in the 
context of irritation and injury to the esophagus rather than systemic bleeding risk.

The FDA label for ALENDRONATE does not directly address whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of systemic bleeding. It does mention the possibility of esophageal adverse experiences, which 
can include bleeding, but this is specifically related to irritation and injury to the esophagus, not a general bleeding risk. Therefore, based on the available FDA label information, it is not 
possible to determine the effect of ALENDRONATE on the risk of bleeding.
