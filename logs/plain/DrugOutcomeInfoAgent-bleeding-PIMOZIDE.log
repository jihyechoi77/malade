CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect: In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and 
agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug
induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently 
during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of pimozide should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. 
Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. PIMOZIDE: 
precautions: Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue pimozide and have their WBC followed until recovery. GENERAL Pimozide may impair the mental 
and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during the first few days of therapy. Pimozide produces 
anticholinergic side effects and should be used with caution in individuals whose conditions may be aggravated by anticholinergic activity. Pimozide should be administered cautiously to patients with 
impairment of liver or kidney function, because it is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Antipsychotics should be administered with caution to patients receiving anticonvulsant 
medication, with a history of seizures, or with EEG abnormalities, because they may lower the convulsive threshold. If indicated, adequate anticonvulsant therapy should be maintained concomitantly. 
PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Treatment with pimozide tablets, USP exposes the patient to serious risks. A decision to use pimozide tablets, USP chronically in 
Tourette’s Disorder is one that deserves full consideration by the patient (or patient’s family) as well as by the treating physician. Because the goal of treatment is symptomatic improvement, the 
patient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary 
source of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only 
for use in patients with Tourette’s Disorder whose symptoms are severe and who cannot tolerate, or who do not respond to HALDOL ® (haloperidol). PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Given the 
likelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if 
possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to 
understand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under 12 years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP 
from foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed
that all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected 
deaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the 
heart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.
Also, pimozide, at a dose about 15 times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. 
Similar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the 
drug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride may be required for control of such reactions. It should be 
noted that persistent extrapyramidal reactions have been reported and that the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases. Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs: Generally, patients receiving 
short term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt 
withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under “Tardive Dyskinesia” except for duration. It is not known whether gradual 
withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs, but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw 
use of pimozide. PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Tardive Dyskinesia: Pimozide may be associated with persistent dyskinesias. Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, 
involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may occur after drug therapy has been discontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on 
high-dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue, face, mouth or
jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities and the trunk. There is no known 
effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; antiparkinson agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms
appear. PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked. It
has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop. 
Electrocardiographic Changes: Electrocardiographic changes have been observed in clinical trials of pimozide in Tourette’s Disorder and schizophrenia. These have included prolongation of the QT 
interval, flattening, notching and inversion of the T wave and the appearance of U waves. Sudden, unexpected deaths and grand mal seizure have occurred at doses above 20 mg/day. Neuroleptic Malignant 
Syndrome: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported with pimozide. (See WARNINGS for further information concerning NMS. PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Hyperpyrexia: Hyperpyrexia has been 
reported with other antipsychotic drugs. Clinical Trials The following adverse reaction tabulation was derived from 20 patients in a 6-week long placebo-controlled clinical trial of pimozide in

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: warnings: WARNINGS The use of pimozide in the treatment of Tourette’s Disorder involves different risk/benefit considerations than when antipsychotic drugs are used to treat other 
conditions. Consequently, a decision to use pimozide should take into consideration the following (see also PRECAUTIONS - Information for Patients ). Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome consisting of 
potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, 
especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether 
antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. PIMOZIDE: warnings: Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become 
irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, 
although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially 
or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly 
mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a
manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. PIMOZIDE: warnings: Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic 
illness, that 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who 
do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be 
reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment 
despite the presence of the syndrome. (For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS - Information 
for Patients . PIMOZIDE: warnings: ) Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in 
association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability 
(irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal 
failure. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious 
medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). PIMOZIDE: warnings: Other important considerations in the 
differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The management of NMS should include 1) immediate 
discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious 
medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic
drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been 
reported. Hyperpyrexia, not associated with the above symptom complex, has been reported with other antipsychotic drugs. Other Sudden, unexpected deaths have occurred in experimental studies of 
conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. PIMOZIDE: warnings: These deaths occurred while patients were receiving dosages in the range of 1 mg per kg. One possible mechanism for such deaths is 
prolongation of the QT interval predisposing patients to ventricular arrhythmia. An electrocardiogram should be performed before pimozide treatment is initiated and periodically thereafter, especially
during the period of dose adjustment. Pimozide may have a tumorigenic potential. Based on studies conducted in mice, it is known that pimozide can produce a dose-related increase in pituitary tumors. 
The full significance of this finding is not known, but should be taken into consideration in the physician’s and patient’s decisions to use this drug product. This finding should be given special 
consideration when the patient is young and chronic use of pimozide is anticipated (see PRECAUTIONS - Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility ).

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: pregnancy: PREGNANCY Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 8 times the maximum human dose did not reveal 
evidence of teratogenicity. In the rat, however, this multiple of the human dose resulted in decreased pregnancies and in the retarded development of fetuses. These effects are thought to be due to an
inhibition or delay in implantation which is also observed in rodents administered other antipsychotic drugs. In the rabbit, maternal toxicity, mortality, decreased weight gain, and embryotoxicity 
including increased resorptions were dose-related. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, pimozide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential 
benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the potential risks. Nonteratogenic effects. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal 
and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. PIMOZIDE: pregnancy: There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these 
neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged 
hospitalization. Pimozide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, 
pimozide causes a dose-related increase in pituitary and mammary tumors. When mice were treated for up to 18 months with pimozide, pituitary gland changes developed in females only. These changes were
characterized as hyperplasia at doses approximating the human dose and adenoma at doses about fifteen times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg per kg basis. The mechanism for the induction of 
pituitary tumors in mice is not known. Mammary gland tumors in female mice were also increased, but these tumors are expected in rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs which elevate prolactin 
levels. Chronic administration of an antipsychotic also causes elevated prolactin levels in humans. PIMOZIDE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Tissue culture experiments 
indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a 
previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of 
elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of these 
drugs and mammary tumorigenesis. The available evidence, however, is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, animals received up to 50 times 
the maximum recommended human dose. No increased incidence of overall tumors or tumors at any site was observed in either sex. Because of the limited number of animals surviving this study, the 
meaning of these results is unclear. PIMOZIDE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Pimozide did not have mutagenic activity in the Ames test with four bacterial test strains, 
in the mouse dominant lethal test or in the micronucleus test in rats. Reproduction studies in animals were not adequate to assess all aspects of fertility. Nevertheless, female rats administered 
pimozide had prolonged estrus cycles, an effect also produced by other antipsychotic drugs.

indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a 
previously detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of 
elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of these 
drugs and mammary tumorigenesis. The available evidence, however, is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, animals received up to 50 times 
the maximum recommended human dose. No increased incidence of overall tumors or tumors at any site was observed in either sex. Because of the limited number of animals surviving this study, the 
meaning of these results is unclear. PIMOZIDE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Pimozide did not have mutagenic activity in the Ames test with four bacterial test strains, 
in the mouse dominant lethal test or in the micronucleus test in rats. Reproduction studies in animals were not adequate to assess all aspects of fertility. Nevertheless, female rats administered 
pimozide had prolonged estrus cycles, an effect also produced by other antipsychotic drugs.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked. 
It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop. 
Electrocardiographic Changes: Electrocardiographic changes have been observed in clinical trials of pimozide in Tourette’s Disorder and schizophrenia. These have included prolongation of the QT 
interval, flattening, notching and inversion of the T wave and the appearance of U waves. Sudden, unexpected deaths and grand mal seizure have occurred at doses above 20 mg/day. Neuroleptic Malignant 
Syndrome: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported with pimozide. (See WARNINGS for further information concerning NMS. PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Hyperpyrexia: Hyperpyrexia has been

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect: In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and 
agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug
induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently 
during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of pimozide should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. 
Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. PIMOZIDE: 
precautions: Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue pimozide and have their WBC followed until recovery. GENERAL Pimozide may impair the mental 
and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during the first few days of therapy. Pimozide produces 
anticholinergic side effects and should be used with caution in individuals whose conditions may be aggravated by anticholinergic activity. Pimozide should be administered cautiously to patients with 
impairment of liver or kidney function, because it is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Antipsychotics should be administered with caution to patients receiving anticonvulsant 
medication, with a history of seizures, or with EEG abnormalities, because they may lower the convulsive threshold. If indicated, adequate anticonvulsant therapy should be maintained concomitantly. 
PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Treatment with pimozide tablets, USP exposes the patient to serious risks. A decision to use pimozide tablets, USP chronically in 
Tourette’s Disorder is one that deserves full consideration by the patient (or patient’s family) as well as by the treating physician. Because the goal of treatment is symptomatic improvement, the 
patient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary 
source of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only 
for use in patients with Tourette’s Disorder whose symptoms are severe and who cannot tolerate, or who do not respond to HALDOL ® (haloperidol). PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Given the 
likelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if 
possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to 
understand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under 12 years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP 
from foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed
that all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected 
deaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the 
heart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.
Also, pimozide, at a dose about 15 times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. 
Similar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the 
drug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: warnings: WARNINGS The use of pimozide in the treatment of Tourette’s Disorder involves different risk/benefit considerations than when antipsychotic drugs are used to treat other 
conditions. Consequently, a decision to use pimozide should take into consideration the following (see also PRECAUTIONS - Information for Patients ). Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome consisting of 
potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, 
especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether 
antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. PIMOZIDE: warnings: Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become 
irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, 
although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially 
or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and thereby may possibly 
mask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a
manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. PIMOZIDE: warnings: Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic 
illness, that 1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who 
do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be 
reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment 
despite the presence of the syndrome. (For further information about the description of tardive dyskinesia and its clinical detection, please refer to ADVERSE REACTIONS and PRECAUTIONS - Information 
for Patients .

The FDA label for PIMOZIDE does not specify any information regarding the drug's effect on bleeding risk. Therefore, I cannot determine whether PIMOZIDE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.
