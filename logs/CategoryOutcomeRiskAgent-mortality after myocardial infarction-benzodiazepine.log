                Passages:
                1. Drug LORAZEPAM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data provided by FDAHandler does not mention the effect of Lorazepam on mortality after myocardial infarction. Therefore, I cannot determine whether Lorazepam increases or decreases this
risk based on the available FDA label data.
2. Drug DIAZEPAM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether Diazepam increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. After consulting FDAHandler for information on Diazepam, the provided label data did not 
specifically mention the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the FDA label information, we cannot determine the effect of Diazepam on mortality post-myocardial 
infarction. The absence of information in the label suggests that there is no verified causal relationship or that it has not been studied or reported in the context of the FDA label.
3. Drug CLONAZEPAM: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for clonazepam does not specify any information about the drug's effect on mortality risk after a myocardial infarction. This indicates that there may not be a known effect or that it 
has not been sufficiently studied for this specific outcome.

                Does the benzodiazepine category of drugs increase the risk of
                mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the benzodiazepine category of drugs increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The provided passages for Lorazepam, Diazepam, and Clonazepam, which are all benzodiazepines, indicate that there is no specific information available from the FDA label data regarding 
their effect on mortality after myocardial infarction.
2. The absence of information in the FDA label for these drugs suggests that there is no verified causal relationship between benzodiazepines and mortality post-myocardial infarction, or that it has 
not been studied or reported in this context.
3. Without specific data or evidence indicating an effect on mortality after myocardial infarction, it is not possible to determine if benzodiazepines as a category have a clear effect on mortality 
risk in this situation.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the benzodiazepine category of drugs on the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction based on the available information.
