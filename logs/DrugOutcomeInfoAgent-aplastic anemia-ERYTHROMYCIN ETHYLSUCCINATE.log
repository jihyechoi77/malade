CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ery-Ped should only be used to treat bacterial 
infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Ery-Ped is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better 
early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate 
treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ery-Ped or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by 
antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps 
and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: information_for_patients: If this occurs, patients should contact their 
physician as soon as possible.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Orally administered erythromycin ethylsuccinate suspension is readily and reliably absorbed under both fasting and 
nonfasting conditions. Erythromycin diffuses readily into most body fluids. Only low concentrations are normally achieved in the spinal fluid, but passage of the drug across the blood-brain barrier 
increases in meningitis. In the presence of normal hepatic function, erythromycin is concentrated in the liver and excreted in the bile; the effect of hepatic dysfunction on excretion of erythromycin 
by the liver into the bile is not known. Less than 5 percent of the orally administered dose of erythromycin is excreted in active form in the urine. Erythromycin crosses the placental barrier, but 
fetal plasma levels are low. The drug is excreted in human milk. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: microbiology: Microbiology Mechanism of Action Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by 
binding 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible organisms. It does not affect nucleic acid synthesis. Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin and clindamycin, lincomycin, and 
chloramphenicol. Resistance Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone but are susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used concomitantly. Interactions With Other 
Antimicrobials Staphylococci resistant to erythromycin may emerge during a course of therapy. Antimicrobial Activity Erythromycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following 
microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: microbiology: Gram-positive Organisms: Corynebacterium 
diphtheriae Corynebacterium minutissimum Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus (resistant organisms may emerge during treatment) Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-negative 
Organisms: Bordetella pertussis Legionella pneumophila Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other Microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis Entamoeba histolytica Mycoplasma pneumoniae Treponema pallidum Ureaplasma 
urealyticum The following in vitro data are available. Erythromycin exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of 0.

tumorigenicity. Erythromycin stearate did not show genotoxic potential in the Ames, and mouse lymphoma assays or induce chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells. There was no apparent effect on male or 
female fertility in rats treated with erythromycin base by oral gavage at 700 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the maximum human dose on a body surface area basis).

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: General Prescribing Ery-Ped in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to 
provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally excreted by the liver, caution should be exercised when 
erythromycin is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and WARNINGS sections.) Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of 
myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving erythromycin therapy. There have been reports of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) occurring in infants following erythromycin 
therapy. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: In one cohort of 157 newborns who were given erythromycin for pertussis prophylaxis, seven neonates (5%) developed symptoms of non-bilious 
vomiting or irritability with feeding and were subsequently diagnosed as having IHPS requiring surgical pyloromyotomy . A possible dose-response effect was described with an absolute risk of IHPS of 
5.1% for infants who took erythromycin for 8-14 days and 10% for infants who took erythromycin for 15-21 days. 2 Since erythromycin may be used in the treatment of conditions in infants which are 
associated with significant mortality or morbidity (such as pertussis or neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis infections), the benefit of erythromycin therapy needs to be weighed against the potential risk 
of developing IHPS. Parents should be informed to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: Prolonged or repeated use 
of erythromycin may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria or fungi. If superinfection occurs, erythromycin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. When indicated, 
incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Observational studies in humans have reported cardiovascular malformations after exposure
to drug products containing erythromycin during early pregnancy. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing Ery-Ped in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected 
bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally 
excreted by the liver, caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and WARNINGS sections.) Exacerbation of

        Question: Does ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increase or decrease the risk of aplastic anemia?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I attempted to ask FDAHandler whether ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increases the risk of aplastic anemia, but I did not receive a response.
2. Without information from FDAHandler, I cannot provide an evidence-based answer.

        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

I attempted to ask FDAHandler whether ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increases the risk of aplastic anemia, but I did not receive a response. Without information from FDAHandler, I cannot provide an 
evidence-based answer. Therefore, my final answer is that I do not know whether ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.
