[34mThe question was whether LORAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. The FDA label for LORAZEPAM does not directly address this question. However, the label includes warnings about [0m
[34mserious side effects, such as profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death, particularly when used in combination with opioids. It also mentions the potential for abuse, misuse, and [0m
[34maddiction, which can lead to overdose or death. These risks suggest that inappropriate use or misuse of lorazepam could potentially lead to hospitalization, but the label does not provide specific [0m
