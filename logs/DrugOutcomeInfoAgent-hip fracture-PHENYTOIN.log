CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using 
alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of 
intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as “purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin 
injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms 
may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 
Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the 
administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile 
saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and 
abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with
renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view 
of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other 
Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other 
adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of 
fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This 
drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's 
inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above 
Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible 
cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if 
serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.         
SOURCE:PHENYTOIN label


CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this 
should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an 
antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of
a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. PHENYTOIN: 
warnings_and_cautions: If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  . Studies in patients of Chinese 
ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited
evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. 
PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in 
carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to 
carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers  . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate 
clinical vigilance and patient management. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) 
dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan 
Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including 
phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with 
other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. 
PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of 
hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium
Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who 
have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity  . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and 
oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse 
developmental outcomes. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure 
Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are 
advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 
1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . 
Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an 
increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial 
features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in 
combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during 
pregnancy. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental 
toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk
of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic 
measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original 
dosage will probably be indicated. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin 
K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the 
neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in 
children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern 
of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies.

deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth 
retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an 
increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial 
features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in 
combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during 
pregnancy. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental 
toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk
of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic 
measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original 
dosage will probably be indicated. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin 
K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the 
neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in 
children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern 
of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using 
alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of 
intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as “purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin 
injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms 
may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 
Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the 
administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile 
saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and 
abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with
renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view 
of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other 
Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other 
adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of 
fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This 
drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's 
inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above 
Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible 
cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if 
serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this 
should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an 
antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of
a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. PHENYTOIN: 
warnings_and_cautions: If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  . Studies in patients of Chinese 
ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited
evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. 
PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in 
carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to 
carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers  . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate 
clinical vigilance and patient management. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) 
dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan 
Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including 
phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with 
other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. 
PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of 
hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium
Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who 
have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity  . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and 
oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using 
alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of 
intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as “purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin 
injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms 
may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 
Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the 
administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile 
saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and 
abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with
renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view 
of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other 
Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other 
adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of 
fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This 
drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's 
inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above 
Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible 
cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if 
serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such 
as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry.
This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a 
pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other 
manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: The background 
risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during 
pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment
of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased 
levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before 
delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2. PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: 4-fold 
increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been 
reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental 
deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth 
retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this 
should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an 
antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of
a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. PHENYTOIN: 
warnings_and_cautions: If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  . Studies in patients of Chinese 
ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited
evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. 
PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in 
carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to 
carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers  . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate 
clinical vigilance and patient management. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) 
dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan 
Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including 
phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with 
other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. 
PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of 
hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium
Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who 
have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity  . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and 
oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients.

Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are 
advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 
1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . 
Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an 
increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial 
features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in 
combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during 
pregnancy. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental 
toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk
of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic 
measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original 
dosage will probably be indicated. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin 
K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the 
neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in 
children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern 
of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using 
alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of 
intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as “purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin 
injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms 
may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 
Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the 
administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile 
saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and 
abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with
renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view 
of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other 
Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other 
adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of 
fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This 
drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's 
inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above 
Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible 
cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if 
serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this 
should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an 
antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of
a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. PHENYTOIN: 
warnings_and_cautions: If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  . Studies in patients of Chinese 
ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited
evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. 
PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in 
carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to 
carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers  . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate 
clinical vigilance and patient management. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) 
dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan 
Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including 
phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with 
other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. 
PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of 
hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium
Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who 
have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity  . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and 
oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such 
as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry.
This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a 
pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other 
manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: The background 
risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during 
pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment
of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased 
levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before 
delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2. PHENYTOIN: pregnancy: 4-fold 
increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been 
reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental 
deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth 
retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, 
respectively.

        Question: Does PHENYTOIN increase or decrease the risk of hip fracture?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I attempted to use the recipient_message function to ask FDAHandler whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture.
2. However, there was no response from FDAHandler, and therefore no FDA data to inform the answer.

        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. I attempted to obtain information from FDAHandler using the recipient_message function, but there was no response 
provided. Without FDA data to inform the answer, I cannot determine the effect of PHENYTOIN on the risk of hip fracture. Therefore, the final answer is DO-NOT-KNOW.
