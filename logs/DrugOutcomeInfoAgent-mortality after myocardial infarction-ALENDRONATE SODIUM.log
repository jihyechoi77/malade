CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the 
bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled 
during bone turnover. Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of 
low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females 
but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: These changes
result in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to 
age 90, the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or 
more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. 
ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent 
inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). 
These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. 
Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides 
of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pharmacodynamics: Similar decreases were seen 
in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3
to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of 
bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In 
osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pregnancy: The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of 
administration (intravenous versus oral) on the risk has not been studied. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All 
pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in 
clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies in rats dosed orally from before mating to the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased 
postimplantation survival starting at 2 mg/kg/day and decreased body weight gain starting at 1 mg/kg/day, doses equivalent to less than half the 40 mg clinical daily dose based on body surface area, 
mg/m 2 . ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pregnancy: Incidence of incomplete fetal ossification in vertebral, skull, and sternebral bones were increased in rats dosed orally during organogenesis starting at 10 
mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). No similar fetal effects were observed in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis at up to 35 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 
approximately 10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). Both total and ionized calcium decreased in pregnant rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical 
daily dose) resulting in delays and failures of delivery. Protracted parturition due to maternal hypocalcemia was observed when rats were treated from before mating through gestation starting at 0.5 
mg/kg/day (approximately one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily dose). ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pregnancy: Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy deaths) also occurred in female rats treated orally with 15 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) for varying gestational time periods. These maternal deaths were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment. Calcium supplementation in
the drinking water or by subcutaneous minipump to rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate could not ameliorate the hypocalcemia or prevent the dystocia-related maternal and neonatal deaths. 
However, intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths.

SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: However, intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether alendronate is present
in human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's 
clinical need for BINOSTO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BINOSTO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use BINOSTO is not indicated for use in 
pediatric patients. The safety and efficacy of alendronate sodium were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4-18 years, with severe
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight less than 40 kg) or 10 mg 
alendronate sodium daily (weight greater than or equal to 40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD 
Z-score from baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the alendronate-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo- treated patients. Treatment with alendronate sodium did not reduce the risk of fracture. Sixteen 
percent of the alendronate-treated patients who sustained a radiologically-confirmed fracture by Month 12 of the study had delayed fracture healing (callus remodeling) or fracture non-union when 
assessed radiographically at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: In alendronate-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data 
obtained at Month 24 demonstrated decreased bone turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between 
the alendronate sodium and placebo groups in reduction of bone pain. The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed in adults. The overall safety profile of alendronate sodium in 
osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated for up to 24 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium. However, there was an increased occurrence of 
vomiting in osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated with alendronate sodium compared to placebo. During the 24-month treatment period, vomiting was observed in 32 of 109 (29.4%) patients treated with
alendronate sodium and 3 of 30 (10%) patients treated with placebo.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pregnancy: The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of 
administration (intravenous versus oral) on the risk has not been studied. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All 
pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in 
clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies in rats dosed orally from before mating to the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased 
postimplantation survival starting at 2 mg/kg/day and decreased body weight gain starting at 1 mg/kg/day, doses equivalent to less than half the 40 mg clinical daily dose based on body surface area, 
mg/m 2 . ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pregnancy: Incidence of incomplete fetal ossification in vertebral, skull, and sternebral bones were increased in rats dosed orally during organogenesis starting at 10 
mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). No similar fetal effects were observed in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis at up to 35 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 
approximately 10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). Both total and ionized calcium decreased in pregnant rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical 
daily dose) resulting in delays and failures of delivery. Protracted parturition due to maternal hypocalcemia was observed when rats were treated from before mating through gestation starting at 0.5 
mg/kg/day (approximately one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily dose). ALENDRONATE SODIUM: pregnancy: Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy deaths) also occurred in female rats treated orally with 15 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) for varying gestational time periods. These maternal deaths were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment. Calcium supplementation in
the drinking water or by subcutaneous minipump to rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate could not ameliorate the hypocalcemia or prevent the dystocia-related maternal and neonatal deaths. 
However, intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women BINOSTO (alendronate sodium) effervescent tablet 70 mg is bioequivalent to 
alendronate sodium tablet 70 mg. The fracture reduction efficacy and bone mineral density changes attributed to BINOSTO are based on clinical trial data of alendronate sodium 10 mg daily and 
alendronate sodium 70 mg weekly. Daily Dosing The efficacy of alendronate sodium 10 mg daily was assessed in four clinical trials. Study 1, a three-year, multicenter double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
US clinical study enrolled 478 patients with a BMD T-score at or below minus 2.5 with or without a prior vertebral fracture; Study 2, a three-year, multicenter double blind placebo controlled 
Multinational clinical study enrolled 516 patients with a BMD T-score at or below minus 2. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: 5 with or without a prior vertebral fracture; Study 3, the Three-Year 
Study of the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) a study which enrolled 2027 postmenopausal patients with at least one baseline vertebral fracture; and Study 4, the Four-Year Study of FIT: a study which
enrolled 4432 postmenopausal patients with low bone mass but without a baseline vertebral fracture. Effect on Fracture Incidence To assess the effects of alendronate sodium on the incidence of 
vertebral fractures (detected by digitized radiography; approximately one third of these were clinically symptomatic), the U.S. and Multinational studies were combined in an analysis that compared 
placebo to the pooled dosage groups of alendronate sodium (5 or 10 mg for three years or 20 mg for two years followed by 5 mg for one year). ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: There was a 
statistically significant reduction in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate experiencing one or more new vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo (3.2% vs. 6.2%; a 48%
relative risk reduction). A reduction in the total number of new vertebral fractures (4.2 vs. 11.3 per 100 patients) was also observed. In the pooled analysis, patients who received alendronate had a 
loss in stature that was statistically significantly less than was observed in those who received placebo (-3.0 mm vs. -4.6 mm). The Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) consisted of two studies in 
postmenopausal women: the Three-Year Study of patients who had at least one baseline radiographic vertebral fracture and the Four-Year Study of patients with low bone mass but without a baseline 
vertebral fracture. In both studies of FIT, 96% of randomized patients completed the studies (i.e. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: had a closeout visit at the scheduled end of the study); 
approximately 80% of patients were still taking study medication upon completion. Fracture Intervention Trial: Three-Year Study (patients with at least one baseline radiographic vertebral fracture) 
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2027-patient study (alendronate, n=1022; placebo, n=1005) demonstrated that treatment with alendronate sodium resulted in statistically significant 
reductions in fracture incidence at three years as shown in Table 4. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: Table 4 Effect of Alendronate Sodium on Fracture Incidence in the Three-Year Study of FIT

SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: However, intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether alendronate is present
in human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's 
clinical need for BINOSTO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BINOSTO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use BINOSTO is not indicated for use in 
pediatric patients. The safety and efficacy of alendronate sodium were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4-18 years, with severe
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight less than 40 kg) or 10 mg 
alendronate sodium daily (weight greater than or equal to 40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD 
Z-score from baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the alendronate-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo- treated patients. Treatment with alendronate sodium did not reduce the risk of fracture. Sixteen 
percent of the alendronate-treated patients who sustained a radiologically-confirmed fracture by Month 12 of the study had delayed fracture healing (callus remodeling) or fracture non-union when 
assessed radiographically at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: In alendronate-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data 
obtained at Month 24 demonstrated decreased bone turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between 
the alendronate sodium and placebo groups in reduction of bone pain. The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed in adults. The overall safety profile of alendronate sodium in 
osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated for up to 24 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium. However, there was an increased occurrence of 
vomiting in osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated with alendronate sodium compared to placebo. During the 24-month treatment period, vomiting was observed in 32 of 109 (29.4%) patients treated with
alendronate sodium and 3 of 30 (10%) patients treated with placebo. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: In a pharmacokinetic study, 6 of 24 pediatric osteogenesis imperfecta patients who 
received a single oral dose of alendronate sodium 35 or 70 mg developed fever, flu-like symptoms, and/or mild lymphocytopenia within 24 to 48 hours after administration. These events, lasting no more 
than 2 to 3 days and responding to acetaminophen, are consistent with an acute-phase response that has been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium. [See Adverse 
Reactions (6.2) .] 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the patients receiving alendronate sodium in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), 71% (n=2302) were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 17% (n=550) 
were greater than or equal to 75 years of age.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress 
osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In
addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone 
hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process
is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is 
characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic 
fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone 
turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 
50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90, the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 
15- to 30-fold. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or 
wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for
six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen 
degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the 
discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 
mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively,
to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease 
in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with 
alendronate sodium. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific 
alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate 
sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal 
women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data 
indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone.
