CONTENT: MINOCYCLINE: drug_interactions: 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. ( 7.1 ) • The concurrent use of 
tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. ( 7.3 ) • To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during 
treatment with minocycline. ( 7.5 ) 7.1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward 
adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. 7.2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class drugs 
in conjunction with penicillin. 7. MINOCYCLINE: drug_interactions: 3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. 7.4 
Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and iron-containing preparations. 7.5 Low Dose Oral Contraceptives In a 
multi-center study to evaluate the effect of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets on low dose oral contraceptives, hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without minocycline 
hydrochloride extended-release tablets 1 mg/kg once-daily were measured. Based on the results of this trial, minocycline-related changes in estradiol, progestinic hormone, FSH and LH plasma levels, of
breakthrough bleeding, or of contraceptive failure, cannot be ruled out. MINOCYCLINE: drug_interactions: To avoid contraceptive failure, female patients are advised to use a second form of 
contraceptive during treatment with minocycline. 7.6 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test.

CONTENT: MINOCYCLINE: clinical_studies: 14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular 
moderate to severe acne vulgaris was assessed in two 12-week, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, studies in subjects ≥ 12 years. The mean age of subjects was 20 years and 
subjects were from the following racial groups: White (73%), Hispanic (13%), Black (11%), Asian/Pacific Islander (2%), and Other (2%). In two efficacy and safety trials, a total of 924 subjects with 
non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris received minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets or placebo for a total of 12 weeks, according to the following dose assignments. MINOCYCLINE:

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether MINOCYCLINE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.
2. FDAHandler responded that MINOCYCLINE has been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, which suggests that it could potentially increase the risk of bleeding. Patients on anticoagulant 
therapy may require a downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage when taking MINOCYCLINE, according to the MINOCYCLINE label.

MINOCYCLINE has been shown to potentially increase the risk of bleeding by depressing plasma prothrombin activity. This information is based on the MINOCYCLINE label, which indicates that patients on 
anticoagulant therapy may need to adjust their dosage when taking MINOCYCLINE.
