CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: pharmacodynamics: 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the 
bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled 
during bone turnover. Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of 
low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females 
but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. ALENDRONATE: pharmacodynamics: These changes result
in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90,
the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or more 
osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. 
ALENDRONATE: pharmacodynamics: Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of 
bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These 
biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. Long-term 
treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l 
collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. ALENDRONATE: pharmacodynamics: Similar decreases were seen in patients in 
osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months 
reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone 
formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In 
osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: pregnancy: The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration 
(intravenous versus oral) on the risk has not been studied. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a 
background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized 
pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies in rats dosed orally from before mating to the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased postimplantation 
survival starting at 2 mg/kg/day and decreased body weight gain starting at 1 mg/kg/day, doses equivalent to less than half the 40 mg clinical daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m 2 . 
ALENDRONATE: pregnancy: Incidence of incomplete fetal ossification in vertebral, skull, and sternebral bones were increased in rats dosed orally during organogenesis starting at 10 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 3 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). No similar fetal effects were observed in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis at up to 35 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 
10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). Both total and ionized calcium decreased in pregnant rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) 
resulting in delays and failures of delivery. Protracted parturition due to maternal hypocalcemia was observed when rats were treated from before mating through gestation starting at 0.5 mg/kg/day 
(approximately one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily dose). ALENDRONATE: pregnancy: Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy deaths) also occurred in female rats treated orally with 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 
times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) for varying gestational time periods. These maternal deaths were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment. Calcium supplementation in the drinking 
water or by subcutaneous minipump to rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate could not ameliorate the hypocalcemia or prevent the dystocia-related maternal and neonatal deaths. However, 
intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths.

use_in_specific_populations: However, intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether alendronate is present in 
human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical 
need for BINOSTO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BINOSTO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use BINOSTO is not indicated for use in pediatric 
patients. The safety and efficacy of alendronate sodium were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4-18 years, with severe 
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight less than 40 kg) or 10 mg alendronate 
sodium daily (weight greater than or equal to 40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score from 
baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the alendronate-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo- treated patients. Treatment with alendronate sodium did not reduce the risk of fracture. Sixteen percent of the
alendronate-treated patients who sustained a radiologically-confirmed fracture by Month 12 of the study had delayed fracture healing (callus remodeling) or fracture non-union when assessed 
radiographically at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: In alendronate-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data obtained at Month 
24 demonstrated decreased bone turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between the alendronate 
sodium and placebo groups in reduction of bone pain. The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed in adults. The overall safety profile of alendronate sodium in osteogenesis 
imperfecta patients treated for up to 24 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium. However, there was an increased occurrence of vomiting in 
osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated with alendronate sodium compared to placebo. During the 24-month treatment period, vomiting was observed in 32 of 109 (29.4%) patients treated with alendronate
sodium and 3 of 30 (10%) patients treated with placebo.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: pharmacodynamics: 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the 
bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled 
during bone turnover. Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of 
low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females 
but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. ALENDRONATE: pharmacodynamics: These changes result
in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90,
the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or more 
osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. 
ALENDRONATE: pharmacodynamics: Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of 
bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These 
biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. Long-term 
treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l 
collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. ALENDRONATE: pharmacodynamics: Similar decreases were seen in patients in 
osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months 
reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone 
formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In 
osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: pregnancy: The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration 
(intravenous versus oral) on the risk has not been studied. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a 
background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized 
pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Reproduction studies in rats dosed orally from before mating to the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased postimplantation 
survival starting at 2 mg/kg/day and decreased body weight gain starting at 1 mg/kg/day, doses equivalent to less than half the 40 mg clinical daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m 2 . 
ALENDRONATE: pregnancy: Incidence of incomplete fetal ossification in vertebral, skull, and sternebral bones were increased in rats dosed orally during organogenesis starting at 10 mg/kg/day 
(approximately 3 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). No similar fetal effects were observed in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis at up to 35 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 
10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). Both total and ionized calcium decreased in pregnant rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) 
resulting in delays and failures of delivery. Protracted parturition due to maternal hypocalcemia was observed when rats were treated from before mating through gestation starting at 0.5 mg/kg/day 
(approximately one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily dose). ALENDRONATE: pregnancy: Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy deaths) also occurred in female rats treated orally with 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 
times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) for varying gestational time periods. These maternal deaths were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment. Calcium supplementation in the drinking 
water or by subcutaneous minipump to rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate could not ameliorate the hypocalcemia or prevent the dystocia-related maternal and neonatal deaths. However, 
intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths.

use_in_specific_populations: However, intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether alendronate is present in 
human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical 
need for BINOSTO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BINOSTO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use BINOSTO is not indicated for use in pediatric 
patients. The safety and efficacy of alendronate sodium were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4-18 years, with severe 
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight less than 40 kg) or 10 mg alendronate 
sodium daily (weight greater than or equal to 40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score from 
baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the alendronate-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo- treated patients. Treatment with alendronate sodium did not reduce the risk of fracture. Sixteen percent of the
alendronate-treated patients who sustained a radiologically-confirmed fracture by Month 12 of the study had delayed fracture healing (callus remodeling) or fracture non-union when assessed 
radiographically at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: In alendronate-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data obtained at Month 
24 demonstrated decreased bone turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between the alendronate 
sodium and placebo groups in reduction of bone pain. The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed in adults. The overall safety profile of alendronate sodium in osteogenesis 
imperfecta patients treated for up to 24 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium. However, there was an increased occurrence of vomiting in 
osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated with alendronate sodium compared to placebo. During the 24-month treatment period, vomiting was observed in 32 of 109 (29.4%) patients treated with alendronate
sodium and 3 of 30 (10%) patients treated with placebo.

The FDA label data does not specify whether alendronate increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Therefore, we cannot determine the effect of alendronate on mortality 
post-myocardial infarction based on the available FDA label information.
