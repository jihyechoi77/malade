[31manticholinergic side effects and should be used with caution in individuals whose conditions may be aggravated by anticholinergic activity. Pimozide should be administered cautiously to patients with [0m
[31mimpairment of liver or kidney function, because it is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Antipsychotics should be administered with caution to patients receiving anticonvulsant [0m

[31mpatient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary [0m
[31msource of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only [0m

[31mlikelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if [0m
[31mpossible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to [0m
[31munderstand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under [0m[1;31m12[0m[31m years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP [0m
[31mfrom foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed[0m
[31mthat all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected [0m
[31mdeaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the [0m
[31mheart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.[0m
[31mAlso, pimozide, at a dose about [0m[1;31m15[0m[31m times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. [0m
[31mSimilar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the [0m
[31mdrug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.         [0m

[31mconditions. Consequently, a decision to use pimozide should take into consideration the following [0m[1;31m([0m[31msee also PRECAUTIONS - Information for Patients [0m[1;31m)[0m[31m. Tardive Dyskinesia A syndrome consisting of [0m
[31mpotentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, [0m
[31mespecially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether [0m
[31mantipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. PIMOZIDE: warnings: Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become [0m
[31mirreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, [0m
[31malthough much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although the syndrome may remit, partially [0m

[31mmask the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, antipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a[0m

[31m        Feedback: The reasoning process appears to be sound. The user has checked with FDAHandler regarding the effects of PIMOZIDE on the risk of angioedema and received responses indicating that the[0m
[31mlabel does not mention angioedema either as a known risk or as a condition affected by the drug. Since the user has relied on the information provided by FDAHandler and has clearly stated that the [0m
[31mlabel does not mention angioedema in relation to PIMOZIDE, the DO-NOT-KNOW answer is justified. There are no flaws in the reasoning provided.[0m

[31m        If any flaws in the reasoning used to produce your[0m
[31m        answer were identified, you must try again.[0m

[32mThe FDA label for PIMOZIDE does not mention angioedema as a known risk or observed side effect, nor does it indicate that PIMOZIDE decreases the risk of angioedema. Therefore, based on the available [0m
[32mFDA label data, it is not possible to determine whether PIMOZIDE increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.[0m
