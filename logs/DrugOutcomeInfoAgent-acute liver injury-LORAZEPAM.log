[32mThe question was whether LORAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of acute liver injury. Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, the lorazepam label does not specifically mention an [0m

[32mrecommends dosage adjustments for these patients. Additionally, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are suggested for patients on long-term therapy, which implies some concern about the [0m
