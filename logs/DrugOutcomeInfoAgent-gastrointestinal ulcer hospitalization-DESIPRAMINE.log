[31mantidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the [0m
[31mworsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. DESIPRAMINE: warnings:[0m
[31mConsideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent[0m
[31msuicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting [0m
[31msymptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the [0m
[31mneed to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such [0m
[31msymptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for desipramine hydrochloride should be written for the [0m
[31msmallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive [0m
[31mepisode may be the initial presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed [0m[1;31m([0m[31mthough not established in controlled trials[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may [0m
[31mincrease the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However,[0m
[31mprior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should [0m

[31mwarnings: All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in [0m
[31mbehavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, [0m

[31mantidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the [0m
[31mworsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. DESIPRAMINE: warnings:[0m
[31mConsideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent[0m
[31msuicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting [0m
[31msymptoms. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the [0m
[31mneed to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such [0m
[31msymptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for desipramine hydrochloride should be written for the [0m
[31msmallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. DESIPRAMINE: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder: A major depressive [0m

[31mincrease the likelihood of precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However,[0m
[31mprior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should [0m
[31minclude a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that desipramine hydrochloride is not approved for use in treating [0m

[32mThe justification for this response is that the FDA label data, which FDAHandler uses to provide information, does not contain information about the relationship between Desipramine and the risk of [0m
[32mgastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. As a result, we cannot determine whether Desipramine has an effect on this risk.[0m
