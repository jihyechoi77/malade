CONTENT: BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger 
subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate 
deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or 
without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased 
incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be 
monitored. BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage 
adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
section). The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given 
concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM 
treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Bactrim Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Bactrim DS Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.
BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher 
and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics ).

CONTENT: BACTRIM: drug_and_or_laboratory_test_interactions: Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions BACTRIM, specifically the trimethoprim component, can interfere with a serum methotrexate assay as 
determined by the competitive binding protein technique (CBPA) when a bacterial dihydrofolate reductase is used as the binding protein. No interference occurs, however, if methotrexate is measured by 
a radioimmunoassay (RIA). The presence of BACTRIM may also interfere with the Jaffé alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine, resulting in overestimations of about 10% in the range of normal 
values.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions Potential for BACTRIM to Affect Other Drugs Trimethoprim is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 as well as OCT2 transporter. Sulfamethoxazole is an inhibitor 
of CYP2C9. Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM with drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8 and 2C9 or OCT2. Table 1: Drug Interactions with BACTRIM Drug(s) Recommendation Comments Diuretics Avoid 
concurrent use In elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Warfarin Monitor 
prothrombin time and INR It has been reported that BACTRIM may prolong the prothrombin time in patients who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate). BACTRIM: drug_interactions: 
This interaction should be kept in mind when BACTRIM is given to patients already on anticoagulant therapy, and the coagulation time should be reassessed. Phenytoin Monitor serum phenytoin levels 
BACTRIM may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin (a CYP2C9 substrate). BACTRIM, given at a common clinical dosage, increased the phenytoin half-life by 39% and decreased the phenytoin metabolic
clearance rate by 27%. When administering these drugs concurrently, one should be alert for possible excessive phenytoin effect. Methotrexate Avoid concurrent use Sulfonamides can also displace 
methotrexate from plasma protein binding sites and can compete with the renal transport of methotrexate, thus increasing free methotrexate concentrations. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Cyclosporine 
Avoid concurrent use There have been reports of marked but reversible nephrotoxicity with coadministration of BACTRIM and cyclosporine in renal transplant recipients. Digoxin Monitor serum digoxin 
levels Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Indomethacin Avoid concurrent use Increased sulfamethoxazole blood levels may occur in
patients who are also receiving indomethacin. Pyrimethamine Avoid concurrent use Occasional reports suggest that patients receiving pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis in doses exceeding 25 mg weekly
may develop megaloblastic anemia if BACTRIM is prescribed. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) Monitor therapeutic response and adjust dose of TCA accordingly The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants 
can decrease when coadministered with BACTRIM. BACTRIM: drug_interactions: Oral Hypoglycemics Monitor blood glucose more frequently Like other sulfonamide-containing drugs, BACTRIM potentiates the 
effect of oral hypoglycemic that are metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone) or CYP2C9 (e.g., glipizide and glyburide) or eliminated renally via OCT2 (e.g., 
metformin). Additional monitoring of blood glucose may be warranted. Amantadine Avoid concurrent use In the literature, a single case of toxic delirium has been reported after concomitant intake of 
BACTRIM and amantadine (an OCT2 substrate). Cases of interactions with other OCT2 substrates, memantine and metformin, have also been reported.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: precautions: Animal Data In rats, oral doses of either 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly as cleft palates. These 
doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole was 
used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the 
human therapeutic dose based on body surface area. Nonteratogenic Effects See CONTRAINDICATIONS section. Nursing Mothers Levels of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in breast milk are approximately 
2–5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. BACTRIM: precautions: Caution should be exercised when BACTRIM is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding 
jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus. Pediatric Use BACTRIM is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of 
age (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they 
respond differently from younger subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or

CONTENT: BACTRIM: precautions: Animal Data In rats, oral doses of either 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly as cleft palates. These 
doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mg/kg of sulfamethoxazole was 
used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of trimethoprim 6 times the 
human therapeutic dose based on body surface area. Nonteratogenic Effects See CONTRAINDICATIONS section. Nursing Mothers Levels of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in breast milk are approximately 
2–5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. BACTRIM: precautions: Caution should be exercised when BACTRIM is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding 
jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus. Pediatric Use BACTRIM is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of 
age (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they 
respond differently from younger subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or
liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. BACTRIM: precautions: Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS 
sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving 
certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially
in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid 
therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). BACTRIM: precautions: The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, 
with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in 
these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Bactrim Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Bactrim DS Tablets 
contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. BACTRIM: precautions: The mean maximum 
serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric 
Pharmacokinetics ).

The question asked was whether BACTRIM increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. To answer this, I reached out to FDAHandler to inquire about the relationship between BACTRIM and the risk of 
hip fracture. However, FDAHandler's response was DO-NOT-KNOW, which indicates that the FDA label data does not specify any information regarding BACTRIM's effect on the risk of hip fracture.

The lack of information from FDAHandler suggests that there is either no known association between BACTRIM and hip fracture risk according to the FDA label data, or that the data is inconclusive or 
not available. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the FDA label data.

In the absence of specific information from the FDA label data, the degree of reliability of the answer is low, and we cannot determine the degree of risk associated with BACTRIM in relation to hip 
fractures.

<DONE> DO-NOT-KNOW

The justification for this answer is that the FDA label data, as provided by FDAHandler, does not specify whether BACTRIM increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture, and therefore we do not have 
reliable information to answer the question.
