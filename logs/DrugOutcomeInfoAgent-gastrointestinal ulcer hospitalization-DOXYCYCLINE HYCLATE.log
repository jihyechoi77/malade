CONTENT: DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with 
antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this 
occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests In venereal diseases when coexistent syphilis is suspected, darkfield examination should be done before treatment 
is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least 4 months. In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic, should be 
performed. All patients with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis. Patients treated with demeclocycline HCl should have a follow-up serologic test for syphilis 
after 3 months. DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity, patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may 
require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage. Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillins, it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline-class 
drugs in conjunction with penicillin. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. The concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has
been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum, calcium or magnesium and by iron-containing preparations. Carcinogenesis, 
Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of demeclocycline HCl have not been conducted. DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: However, 
there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the related antibiotics oxytetracycline (adrenal and pituitary tumors) and minocycline (thyroid tumors). Although mutagenicity 
studies of demeclocycline HCl have not been conducted, positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays (i.e., mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells) have been reported for related 
antibiotics (tetracyclines HCl and oxytetracycline) (see WARNINGS and ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY AND ANIMAL TOXICOLOGY ). Demeclocycline HCl had no effect on fertility when administered in the diet to male 
and female rats at a daily intake of 45 times the human dose. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category D (See WARNINGS ). DEMECLOCYCLINE HYDROCHLORIDE: precautions: Result of animal studies 
indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). Evidence of 
embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. Nonteratogenic effects (See WARNINGS ) Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown. Nursing 
Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines, a decision should be made whether to discontinue 
nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS ). Pediatric Use Not for use in patients younger than eight years of age .

has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective. Administration of isotretinoin should be 
avoided shortly before, during, and shortly after minocycline therapy. Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri. (See PRECAUTIONS . MINOCIN: drug_interactions: ) Increased risk of

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral doxycycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects of the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been 
infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Gastrointestinal: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, 
inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, and pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral 
administration of tetracyclines. Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition, reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported. Permanent tooth 
discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development. (See WARNINGS . DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ) Rare instances of 
esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of the drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately 
before going to bed. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, skin hyperpigmentation, maculopapular and erythematous rashes. 
Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Photosensitivity is discussed above. (See WARNINGS .) Renal toxicity: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related. (See 
WARNINGS . DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ) Immune: Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, 
exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction has been reported in the setting of spirochete 
infections treated with doxycycline. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Other: Bulging fontanels in infants and intracranial hypertension in 
adults. (See WARNINGS .) When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. No abnormalities of thyroid function
studies are known to occur.

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: clinical_pharmacology: Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half-life of doxycycline (range 18-22 hours) in individuals with normal and severely impaired
renal function. Hemodialysis does not alter serum half-life. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta and are found in fetal tissues. Population pharmacokinetic 
analysis of sparse concentration-time data of doxycycline following standard of care intravenous and oral dosing in 44 pediatric patients (2-18 years of age) showed that allometrically -scaled 
clearance (CL) of doxycycline in pediatric patients ≥2 to ≤8 years of age (median  3.58 [2.27-10.82] L/h/70 kg, N =11) did not differ significantly from pediatric patients >8 to 18 years of age (3 .27
[1.11-8.12] L/h/70 kg, N=33). DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: clinical_pharmacology: For pediatric patients weighing ≤45 kg, body weight normalized doxycycline CL in those ≥2 to ≤8 years of age (median  0.071 [0
.041-0.202] L/kg/h, N=10) did not differ significantly from those >8 to 18 years of age (0.081 [0.035-0.126] L/kg/h, N=8). In pediatric patients weighing >45 kg, no clinically significant differences 
in body weight normalized doxycycline CL were observed between those ≥2 to ≤8 years (0.050 L/kg/h, N=l) and those >8 to 18 years of age (0.044 [0.014-0.121] L/kg/h, N=25). DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: No clinically significant difference in CL between oral and IV dosing was observed in the small cohort of pediatric patients who received the oral (N=19) or IV (N=21) 
formulation alone. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Doxycycline has bacteriostatic activity against a broad 
range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Resistance Cross resistance with other tetracyclines is common. Antimicrobial Activity Doxycycline has been shown to be active against most isolates 
of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the package insert for doxycycline hyclate tablets, USP. DOXYCYCLINE

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and 
duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials  . 5.2 Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia must be 
corrected before initiating therapy with BINOSTO . Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, 
serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with BINOSTO. Presumably due to the effects of BINOSTO on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum 
calcium and phosphate may occur. Patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. 5.

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLATE HYCLATE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibacterial drugs, use of Doxycycline Hyclate Capsules may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including 
fungi. If superinfection occurs, Doxycycline Hyclate Capsules should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in 
conjunction with antibacterial therapy, when indicated. Doxycycline offers substantial but not complete suppression of the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium strains. Doxycycline does not suppress P. 
falciparum ’s sexual blood stage gametocytes. Subjects completing this prophylactic regimen may still transmit the infection to mosquitoes outside endemic areas. Prescribing Doxycycline Hyclate 
Capsules in the absence of proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of 
drug-resistant bacteria. DOXYCYCLATE HYCLATE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis should be advised: that no present-day antimalarial

increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including doxycycline should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral 
infections (e.g., the common cold). When doxycycline is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the
medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the 
likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by doxycycline or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, which 
usually ends when the antibacterials are discontinued. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: information_for_patients: Sometimes after starting treatment with antibacterial drugs, patients can develop watery and 
bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibacterial drug. If this occurs, patients should contact their 
physician as soon as possible.

        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler about the effects of DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that the DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE label does not specifically mention an increase in the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
3. However, the label does note that rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving drugs in the tetracycline class, which includes doxycycline

4. Patients are advised to drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration.
        -----
        Final answer: The FDA label for DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE does not specifically mention an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. However, it does note that rare instances of 
esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported with the use of tetracycline-class drugs, including doxycycline hyclate. Therefore, while there is a potential risk of esophageal irritation 
and ulceration, the degree of risk for gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization is not clearly defined in the FDA label.

The question was whether DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. According to the information provided by FDAHandler, the FDA label for 
DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE does not specifically mention an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. However, the label does note that rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal 
ulcerations have been reported with the use of tetracycline-class drugs, which includes doxycycline hyclate. Patients are advised to drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce the risk of
esophageal irritation and ulceration. Therefore, while there is a potential risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration, the degree of risk for gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization is not clearly 
defined in the FDA label.
