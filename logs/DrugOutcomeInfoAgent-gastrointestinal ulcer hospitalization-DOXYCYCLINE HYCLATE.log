[32mThe question was whether DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. According to the information provided by FDAHandler, the FDA label for [0m
[32mDOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE does not specifically mention an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. However, the label does note that rare instances of esophagitis and esophageal [0m
[32mulcerations have been reported with the use of tetracycline-class drugs, which includes doxycycline hyclate. Patients are advised to drink fluids liberally along with doxycycline to reduce the risk of[0m
[32mesophageal irritation and ulceration. Therefore, while there is a potential risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration, the degree of risk for gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization is not clearly [0m
[32mdefined in the FDA label.[0m
