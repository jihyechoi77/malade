CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure : May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done 
gradually. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions : Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this 
drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity : If signs or symptoms of 
hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is 
indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.7 ) 5. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous 
administration of Phenytoin Sodium Injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included 
bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in 
critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying 
cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a 
rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above 
the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly 
as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because
adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium 
Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly 
discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for 
dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, 
rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic 
Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of 
symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest 
SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and 
symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  . Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the 
presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN 
in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion  
Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus  Serious Dermatologic Reactions  Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity  Hypersensitivity  
Hepatic Injury  Hematopoietic Complications  Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome)  Exacerbation of Porphyria  Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn  Hyperglycemia  The following 
adverse reactions associated with the use of Phenytoin Sodium Injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population
of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the 
intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
adverse_reactions: The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients 
. Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS  have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. 
There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and 
fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: adverse_reactions: Severe complications are most commonly encountered in
elderly or critically ill patients  . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure  , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. 
Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin  . These have included thrombocytopenia, 
leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to 
folic acid therapy.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs),
such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy 
Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website 
http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal 
phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: In addition, the fetal hydantoin 
syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported 
among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other 
manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general 
population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: pregnancy: The 
background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur 
during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate 
adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to 
decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother 
before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2. PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
pregnancy: 4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia
has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and 
neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased 
fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 
mg/kg, respectively.

ANSWER: Phenytoin Sodium does not have a direct effect on the risk of myocardial infarction mentioned in the label. However, it is associated with severe cardiovascular risks when administered rapidly
intravenously, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias such as bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, which can result in asystole, cardiac 
arrest, and death. These severe complications are most commonly encountered in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. The label 
advises careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection.
