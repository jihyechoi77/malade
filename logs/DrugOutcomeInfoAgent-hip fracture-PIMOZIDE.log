CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect: In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and 
agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug
induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently 
during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of pimozide should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. 
Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. PIMOZIDE: 
precautions: Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue pimozide and have their WBC followed until recovery. GENERAL Pimozide may impair the mental 
and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during the first few days of therapy. Pimozide produces 
anticholinergic side effects and should be used with caution in individuals whose conditions may be aggravated by anticholinergic activity. Pimozide should be administered cautiously to patients with 
impairment of liver or kidney function, because it is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Antipsychotics should be administered with caution to patients receiving anticonvulsant 
medication, with a history of seizures, or with EEG abnormalities, because they may lower the convulsive threshold. If indicated, adequate anticonvulsant therapy should be maintained concomitantly. 
PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Treatment with pimozide tablets, USP exposes the patient to serious risks. A decision to use pimozide tablets, USP chronically in 
Tourette’s Disorder is one that deserves full consideration by the patient (or patient’s family) as well as by the treating physician. Because the goal of treatment is symptomatic improvement, the 
patient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary 
source of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only 
for use in patients with Tourette’s Disorder whose symptoms are severe and who cannot tolerate, or who do not respond to HALDOL ® (haloperidol). PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Given the 
likelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if 
possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to 
understand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under 12 years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP 
from foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed
that all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected 
deaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the 
heart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.
Also, pimozide, at a dose about 15 times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. 
Similar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the 
drug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.

patient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary 
source of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only 
for use in patients with Tourette’s Disorder whose symptoms are severe and who cannot tolerate, or who do not respond to HALDOL ® (haloperidol). PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Given the 
likelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if 
possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to 
understand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under 12 years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP 
from foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed
that all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected 
deaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the 
heart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.
Also, pimozide, at a dose about 15 times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. 
Similar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the 
drug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.

The question asked was whether Pimozide increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. I attempted to retrieve information from FDAHandler regarding the effect of Pimozide on the risk of hip 
fracture. However, multiple attempts to obtain information from FDAHandler were unsuccessful. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to determine if Pimozide has an 
effect on the risk of hip fracture. The FDA label for Pimozide does not specify any information regarding its impact on hip fracture risk, which is why the answer is DO-NOT-KNOW.
