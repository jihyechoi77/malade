[31msource of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only [0m

[31mpossible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to [0m
[31munderstand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under [0m[1;31m12[0m[31m years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP [0m
[31mfrom foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed[0m
[31mthat all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected [0m
[31mdeaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Touretteâ€™s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the [0m
[31mheart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.[0m

[31mSimilar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the [0m

[31msource of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only [0m

[31munderstand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under [0m[1;31m12[0m[31m years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP [0m

[31mthat all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected [0m
[31mdeaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Touretteâ€™s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the [0m

[31mSimilar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the [0m

[31mpatientâ€™s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary [0m
[31msource of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only [0m

[31mpossible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to [0m
[31munderstand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under [0m[1;31m12[0m[31m years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP [0m
[31mfrom foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed[0m
[31mthat all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected [0m
[31mdeaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Touretteâ€™s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the [0m
[31mheart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.[0m
[31mAlso, pimozide, at a dose about [0m[1;31m15[0m[31m times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. [0m
[31mSimilar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the [0m

[32mThe question asked was whether Pimozide increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. I attempted to retrieve information from FDAHandler regarding the effect of Pimozide on the risk of hip [0m
[32mfracture. However, multiple attempts to obtain information from FDAHandler were unsuccessful. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to determine if Pimozide has an [0m
[32meffect on the risk of hip fracture. The FDA label for Pimozide does not specify any information regarding its impact on hip fracture risk, which is why the answer is DO-NOT-KNOW.[0m
