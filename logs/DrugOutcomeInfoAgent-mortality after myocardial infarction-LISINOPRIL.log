[31mpressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a[0m
[31mwide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as [0m
[31mappropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than [0m[1;31m1[0m[31m drug to achieve blood pressure [0m

[31mproperty of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in [0m
[31mmyocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg [0m

[31mand bone marrow depression, rarely in uncomplicated patients but more frequently in patients with renal impairment, especially if they also have a collagen vascular disease. Available data from [0m

[32mThe FDAHandler's response did not provide specific information on the effect of LISINOPRIL on mortality after a myocardial infarction has occurred. The information given was related to the [0m
[32mpreventative benefits of LISINOPRIL in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarctions, but did not directly address the post-myocardial infarction mortality. Therefore, I[0m
