CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: There have been post-marketing reports of gastric and 
duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials  . 5.2 Mineral Metabolism Hypocalcemia must be 
corrected before initiating therapy with BINOSTO . Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with these conditions, 
serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with BINOSTO. Presumably due to the effects of BINOSTO on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic decreases in serum 
calcium and phosphate may occur. Patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 3 Musculoskeletal Pain In post-marketing experience, severe and 
occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis  . This category of drugs includes 
BINOSTO. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most 
patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. In placebo-controlled clinical studies of 
alendronate sodium, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the alendronate sodium and placebo groups. 5.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: overdosage: 10 OVERDOSAGE Significant lethality after single oral doses was seen in female rats and mice at 552 mg/kg (3256 mg/m 2 ) and 966 mg/kg (2898 mg/m 2 ), respectively. 
In males, these values were slightly higher, 626 and 1280 mg/kg, respectively. There was no lethality in dogs at oral doses up to 200 mg/kg (4000 mg/m 2 ). No specific information is available on the 
treatment of overdosage with BINOSTO. Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and upper gastrointestinal adverse events, such as upset stomach, heartburn, esophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer, may result from 
oral overdosage. Milk or antacids should be given to bind alendronate. Due to the risk of esophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the patient should remain fully upright. Dialysis 
would not be beneficial.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: dosage_and_administration: 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 70 mg BINOSTO effervescent tablet once weekly. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Instruct patients to: ( 2.3 ) Dissolve one tablet of BINOSTO 
in approximately half a glass of plain room temperature water (4 oz). Wait at least 5 minutes after the effervescence stops, stir the solution for approximately 10 seconds and consume contents. 
Swallow solution at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day. Avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after taking BINOSTO and until after the first food of the day.
2.1 Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women The recommended dosage is one 70 mg effervescent tablet once weekly. 2.2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men With Osteoporosis The recommended 
dosage is one 70 mg effervescent tablet once weekly. 2. ALENDRONATE: dosage_and_administration: 3 Important Administration Instructions Instruct patients to do the following to assure adequate drug 
absorption and to decrease the risk of esophageal adverse reactions: i. Take BINOSTO upon arising for the day and at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day. 
Patients should not swallow the undissolved effervescent tablet, should not chew the effervescent tablet or allow the effervescent tablet to dissolve in their mouths because of the risk for 
oropharyngeal irritation . Dissolve the effervescent tablet in 4 ounces room temperature plain water only (not mineral water or flavored water). ii. Wait at least 5 minutes after the effervescence 
stops and then stir the buffered solution for approximately 10 seconds and ingest. iii. Avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after taking BINOSTO and until after their first food of the day. iv. 
ALENDRONATE: dosage_and_administration: Do not take BINOSTO at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse reactions  . 2.4 
Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate  . Patients at increased risk for vitamin D 
insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 years, nursing home-bound, or chronically ill) may need vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher 
doses of vitamin D supplementation and measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered. 2.5 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses If the once-weekly dose is missed, instruct patients to
take one dose on the morning after they remember. ALENDRONATE: dosage_and_administration: They should not take 2 doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally 
scheduled on their chosen day.

        Question: Does ALENDRONATE increase or decrease the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether ALENDRONATE increases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that Alendronate can cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa and has been associated with esophageal adverse experiences such as esophagitis, esophageal 
ulcers, and erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, which have required hospitalization in some cases. There have also been post-marketing

        Final answer: Alendronate may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, as it has been associated with severe esophageal adverse experiences and post-marketing reports of 
gastric and duodenal ulcers that required hospitalization in some cases. However, it is important to note that no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials, indicating that while there
is a potential risk, it may not be common.
