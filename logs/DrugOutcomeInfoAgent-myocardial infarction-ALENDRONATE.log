[32mThe question was whether ALENDRONATE increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. After consulting with FDAHandler, the response was DO-NOT-KNOW, which indicates that the FDA label for [0m
[32mALENDRONATE does not specify any information regarding its effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine if ALENDRONATE has any [0m
