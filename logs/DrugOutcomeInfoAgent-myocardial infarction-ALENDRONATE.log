CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: Data Animal Data Reproduction studies in rats dosed orally from before mating to the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased postimplantation 
survival starting at 2 mg/kg/day and decreased body weight gain starting at 1 mg/kg/day, doses equivalent to less than half the 40 mg clinical daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m 2 . Incidence
of incomplete fetal ossification in vertebral, skull, and sternebral bones were increased in rats dosed orally during organogenesis starting at 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the 40 mg clinical 
daily dose). No similar fetal effects were observed in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis at up to 35 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). 
ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: Both total and ionized calcium decreased in pregnant rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) 
resulting in delays and failures of delivery. Protracted parturition due to maternal hypocalcemia was observed when rats were treated from before mating through gestation starting at 0.5 mg/kg/day 
(approximately one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily dose). Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy deaths) also occurred in female rats treated orally with 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical
daily dose) for varying gestational time periods. These maternal deaths were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment. Calcium supplementation in the drinking water or by subcutaneous 
minipump to rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate could not ameliorate the hypocalcemia or prevent the dystocia-related maternal and neonatal deaths. ALENDRONATE: 
use_in_specific_populations: However, intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether alendronate is present in 
human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical 
need for BINOSTO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BINOSTO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use BINOSTO is not indicated for use in pediatric 
patients. The safety and efficacy of alendronate sodium were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4-18 years, with severe 
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight less than 40 kg) or 10 mg alendronate 
sodium daily (weight greater than or equal to 40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score from 
baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the alendronate-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo- treated patients. Treatment with alendronate sodium did not reduce the risk of fracture. Sixteen percent of the
alendronate-treated patients who sustained a radiologically-confirmed fracture by Month 12 of the study had delayed fracture healing (callus remodeling) or fracture non-union when assessed 
radiographically at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: In alendronate-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data obtained at Month 
24 demonstrated decreased bone turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between the alendronate 
sodium and placebo groups in reduction of bone pain. The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed in adults. The overall safety profile of alendronate sodium in osteogenesis 
imperfecta patients treated for up to 24 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium. However, there was an increased occurrence of vomiting in 
osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated with alendronate sodium compared to placebo. During the 24-month treatment period, vomiting was observed in 32 of 109 (29.4%) patients treated with alendronate
sodium and 3 of 30 (10%) patients treated with placebo.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: pharmacokinetics: Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary 
for patients with creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min. BINOSTO is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with alendronate in renal 
failure. Hepatic Impairment: As there is evidence that alendronate is not metabolized or excreted in the bile, no studies were conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is 
necessary. Drug Interactions Ranitidine: Intravenous ranitidine was shown to double the bioavailability of oral alendronate. The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and whether 
similar increases will occur in patients given oral H 2 -antagonists is unknown. ALENDRONATE: pharmacokinetics: Prednisone: In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days)
did not produce a clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20 to 44%). Calcium and Multivalent Cations: Products containing calcium and 
other multivalent cations are likely to interfere with absorption of alendronate. Levothyroxine: The geometric mean AUC(0-∞) and C max of alendronate decreased by 7% (point estimate: 0.93; 90% CI: 
0.79-1.08) and 9% (point estimate: 0.91; 90% CI: 0.77-1. ALENDRONATE: pharmacokinetics: 08), respectively, when a single dose of BINOSTO (70 mg alendronate) and 600 mcg levothyroxine were given 
concomitantly to 29 healthy male and female subjects.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: Data Animal Data Reproduction studies in rats dosed orally from before mating to the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased postimplantation 
survival starting at 2 mg/kg/day and decreased body weight gain starting at 1 mg/kg/day, doses equivalent to less than half the 40 mg clinical daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m 2 . Incidence
of incomplete fetal ossification in vertebral, skull, and sternebral bones were increased in rats dosed orally during organogenesis starting at 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the 40 mg clinical 
daily dose). No similar fetal effects were observed in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis at up to 35 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). 
ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: Both total and ionized calcium decreased in pregnant rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) 
resulting in delays and failures of delivery. Protracted parturition due to maternal hypocalcemia was observed when rats were treated from before mating through gestation starting at 0.5 mg/kg/day 
(approximately one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily dose). Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy deaths) also occurred in female rats treated orally with 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical
daily dose) for varying gestational time periods. These maternal deaths were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment. Calcium supplementation in the drinking water or by subcutaneous 
minipump to rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate could not ameliorate the hypocalcemia or prevent the dystocia-related maternal and neonatal deaths. ALENDRONATE: 
use_in_specific_populations: However, intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether alendronate is present in 
human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical 
need for BINOSTO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BINOSTO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use BINOSTO is not indicated for use in pediatric 
patients. The safety and efficacy of alendronate sodium were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4-18 years, with severe 
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight less than 40 kg) or 10 mg alendronate 
sodium daily (weight greater than or equal to 40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score from 
baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the alendronate-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo- treated patients. Treatment with alendronate sodium did not reduce the risk of fracture. Sixteen percent of the
alendronate-treated patients who sustained a radiologically-confirmed fracture by Month 12 of the study had delayed fracture healing (callus remodeling) or fracture non-union when assessed 
radiographically at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: In alendronate-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data obtained at Month 
24 demonstrated decreased bone turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between the alendronate 
sodium and placebo groups in reduction of bone pain. The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed in adults. The overall safety profile of alendronate sodium in osteogenesis 
imperfecta patients treated for up to 24 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium. However, there was an increased occurrence of vomiting in 
osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated with alendronate sodium compared to placebo. During the 24-month treatment period, vomiting was observed in 32 of 109 (29.4%) patients treated with alendronate
sodium and 3 of 30 (10%) patients treated with placebo.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: pharmacokinetics: Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary 
for patients with creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min. BINOSTO is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with alendronate in renal 
failure. Hepatic Impairment: As there is evidence that alendronate is not metabolized or excreted in the bile, no studies were conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is 
necessary. Drug Interactions Ranitidine: Intravenous ranitidine was shown to double the bioavailability of oral alendronate. The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and whether 
similar increases will occur in patients given oral H 2 -antagonists is unknown. ALENDRONATE: pharmacokinetics: Prednisone: In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days)
did not produce a clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20 to 44%). Calcium and Multivalent Cations: Products containing calcium and 
other multivalent cations are likely to interfere with absorption of alendronate. Levothyroxine: The geometric mean AUC(0-∞) and C max of alendronate decreased by 7% (point estimate: 0.93; 90% CI: 
0.79-1.08) and 9% (point estimate: 0.91; 90% CI: 0.77-1. ALENDRONATE: pharmacokinetics: 08), respectively, when a single dose of BINOSTO (70 mg alendronate) and 600 mcg levothyroxine were given 
concomitantly to 29 healthy male and female subjects.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new or 
worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper Gastrointestinal 
Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential 
for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, dysphagia, other 
esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and rarely followed 
by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe and required 
hospitalization. ALENDRONATE: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to 
discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences appears to be 
greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after developing symptoms
suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot comply with dosing 
instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: Data Animal Data Reproduction studies in rats dosed orally from before mating to the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased postimplantation 
survival starting at 2 mg/kg/day and decreased body weight gain starting at 1 mg/kg/day, doses equivalent to less than half the 40 mg clinical daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m 2 . Incidence
of incomplete fetal ossification in vertebral, skull, and sternebral bones were increased in rats dosed orally during organogenesis starting at 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the 40 mg clinical 
daily dose). No similar fetal effects were observed in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis at up to 35 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). 
ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: Both total and ionized calcium decreased in pregnant rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) 
resulting in delays and failures of delivery. Protracted parturition due to maternal hypocalcemia was observed when rats were treated from before mating through gestation starting at 0.5 mg/kg/day 
(approximately one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily dose). Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy deaths) also occurred in female rats treated orally with 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical
daily dose) for varying gestational time periods. These maternal deaths were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment. Calcium supplementation in the drinking water or by subcutaneous 
minipump to rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate could not ameliorate the hypocalcemia or prevent the dystocia-related maternal and neonatal deaths. ALENDRONATE: 
use_in_specific_populations: However, intravenous calcium supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether alendronate is present in 
human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has effects on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical 
need for BINOSTO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BINOSTO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use BINOSTO is not indicated for use in pediatric 
patients. The safety and efficacy of alendronate sodium were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4-18 years, with severe 
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight less than 40 kg) or 10 mg alendronate 
sodium daily (weight greater than or equal to 40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score from 
baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the alendronate-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo- treated patients. Treatment with alendronate sodium did not reduce the risk of fracture. Sixteen percent of the
alendronate-treated patients who sustained a radiologically-confirmed fracture by Month 12 of the study had delayed fracture healing (callus remodeling) or fracture non-union when assessed 
radiographically at Month 24 compared with 9% of the placebo-treated patients. ALENDRONATE: use_in_specific_populations: In alendronate-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data obtained at Month 
24 demonstrated decreased bone turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between the alendronate 
sodium and placebo groups in reduction of bone pain. The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed in adults. The overall safety profile of alendronate sodium in osteogenesis 
imperfecta patients treated for up to 24 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium. However, there was an increased occurrence of vomiting in 
osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated with alendronate sodium compared to placebo. During the 24-month treatment period, vomiting was observed in 32 of 109 (29.4%) patients treated with alendronate
sodium and 3 of 30 (10%) patients treated with placebo.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: pharmacokinetics: Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary 
for patients with creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min. BINOSTO is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with alendronate in renal 
failure. Hepatic Impairment: As there is evidence that alendronate is not metabolized or excreted in the bile, no studies were conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is 
necessary. Drug Interactions Ranitidine: Intravenous ranitidine was shown to double the bioavailability of oral alendronate. The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and whether 
similar increases will occur in patients given oral H 2 -antagonists is unknown. ALENDRONATE: pharmacokinetics: Prednisone: In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days)
did not produce a clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20 to 44%). Calcium and Multivalent Cations: Products containing calcium and 
other multivalent cations are likely to interfere with absorption of alendronate. Levothyroxine: The geometric mean AUC(0-∞) and C max of alendronate decreased by 7% (point estimate: 0.93; 90% CI: 
0.79-1.08) and 9% (point estimate: 0.91; 90% CI: 0.77-1. ALENDRONATE: pharmacokinetics: 08), respectively, when a single dose of BINOSTO (70 mg alendronate) and 600 mcg levothyroxine were given 
concomitantly to 29 healthy male and female subjects.

The question was whether ALENDRONATE increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. After consulting with FDAHandler, the response was DO-NOT-KNOW, which indicates that the FDA label for 
ALENDRONATE does not specify any information regarding its effect on the risk of myocardial infarction. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine if ALENDRONATE has any 
effect on the risk of myocardial infarction.
