[31mCONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Available evidence suggests that many depressions have a biochemical basis in the form of a relative deficiency [0m

[31mdeficiencies may be associated with low spinal fluid levels of [0m[1;31m5[0m[31m-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. While the precise mechanism of action of the tricyclic antidepressants is unknown, a leading theory suggests [0m
[31mthat they restore normal levels of neurotransmitters by blocking the re-uptake of these substances from the synapse in the central nervous system. Evidence indicates that the secondary amine tricyclic[0m
[31mantidepressants, including desipramine hydrochloride, may have greater activity in blocking the re-uptake of norepinephrine. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: Tertiary amine tricyclic [0m
[31mantidepressants, such as amitriptyline, may have greater effect on serotonin re-uptake. Desipramine hydrochloride is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor [0m[1;31m([0m[31mMAOI[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m and does not act primarily as a central [0m
[31mnervous system stimulant. It has been found in some studies to have a more rapid onset of action than imipramine. Earliest therapeutic effects may occasionally be seen in [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m to [0m[1;31m5[0m[31m days, but full [0m
[31mtreatment benefit usually requires [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m to [0m[1;31m3[0m[31m weeks to obtain. Metabolism Tricyclic antidepressants, such as desipramine hydrochloride, are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Tricyclic [0m
[31mantidepressants or their metabolites are to some extent excreted through the gastric mucosa and reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Desipramine is metabolized in the liver, and approximately [0m
[1;31m70[0m[31m% is excreted in the urine. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: The rate of metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants varies widely from individual to individual, chiefly on a genetically determined [0m
[31mbasis. Up to a [0m[1;31m36[0m[31m-fold difference in plasma level may be noted among individuals taking the same oral dose of desipramine. The ratio of [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the [0m
[31melderly, most likely due to decreased renal elimination with aging. Certain drugs, particularly the psychostimulants and the phenothiazines, increase plasma levels of concomitantly administered [0m
[31mtricyclic antidepressants through competition for the same metabolic enzyme systems. Concurrent administration of cimetidine and tricyclic antidepressants can produce clinically significant increases [0m
[31min the plasma concentrations of the tricyclic antidepressants. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: Conversely, decreases in plasma levels of the tricyclic antidepressants have been reported upon [0m
[31mdiscontinuation of cimetidine, which may result in the loss of the therapeutic efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant. Other substances, particularly barbiturates and alcohol, induce liver enzyme [0m
[31mactivity and thereby reduce tricyclic antidepressant plasma levels. Similar effects have been reported with tobacco smoke. Research on the relationship of plasma level to therapeutic response with the[0m
[31mtricyclic antidepressants has produced conflicting results. While some studies report no correlation, many studies cite therapeutic levels for most tricyclics in the range of [0m[1;31m50[0m[31m to [0m[1;31m300[0m[31m nanograms per [0m
[31mmilliliter. The therapeutic range is different for each tricyclic antidepressant. For desipramine, an optimal range of therapeutic plasma levels has not been established.         [0m

[31mCONTENT: DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Available evidence suggests that many depressions have a biochemical basis in the form of a relative deficiency [0m
[31mof neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and serotonin. Norepinephrine deficiency may be associated with relatively low urinary [0m[1;31m3[0m[31m-methoxy-[0m[1;31m4[0m[31m- hydroxyphenyl glycol [0m[1;31m([0m[31mMHPG[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m levels, while serotonin [0m
[31mdeficiencies may be associated with low spinal fluid levels of [0m[1;31m5[0m[31m-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. While the precise mechanism of action of the tricyclic antidepressants is unknown, a leading theory suggests [0m
[31mthat they restore normal levels of neurotransmitters by blocking the re-uptake of these substances from the synapse in the central nervous system. Evidence indicates that the secondary amine tricyclic[0m
[31mantidepressants, including desipramine hydrochloride, may have greater activity in blocking the re-uptake of norepinephrine. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: Tertiary amine tricyclic [0m
[31mantidepressants, such as amitriptyline, may have greater effect on serotonin re-uptake. Desipramine hydrochloride is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor [0m[1;31m([0m[31mMAOI[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m and does not act primarily as a central [0m
[31mnervous system stimulant. It has been found in some studies to have a more rapid onset of action than imipramine. Earliest therapeutic effects may occasionally be seen in [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m to [0m[1;31m5[0m[31m days, but full [0m
[31mtreatment benefit usually requires [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m to [0m[1;31m3[0m[31m weeks to obtain. Metabolism Tricyclic antidepressants, such as desipramine hydrochloride, are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Tricyclic [0m
[31mantidepressants or their metabolites are to some extent excreted through the gastric mucosa and reabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Desipramine is metabolized in the liver, and approximately [0m
[1;31m70[0m[31m% is excreted in the urine. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: The rate of metabolism of tricyclic antidepressants varies widely from individual to individual, chiefly on a genetically determined [0m
[31mbasis. Up to a [0m[1;31m36[0m[31m-fold difference in plasma level may be noted among individuals taking the same oral dose of desipramine. The ratio of [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the [0m
[31melderly, most likely due to decreased renal elimination with aging. Certain drugs, particularly the psychostimulants and the phenothiazines, increase plasma levels of concomitantly administered [0m
[31mtricyclic antidepressants through competition for the same metabolic enzyme systems. Concurrent administration of cimetidine and tricyclic antidepressants can produce clinically significant increases [0m
[31min the plasma concentrations of the tricyclic antidepressants. DESIPRAMINE: clinical_pharmacology: Conversely, decreases in plasma levels of the tricyclic antidepressants have been reported upon [0m
[31mdiscontinuation of cimetidine, which may result in the loss of the therapeutic efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressant. Other substances, particularly barbiturates and alcohol, induce liver enzyme [0m
[31mactivity and thereby reduce tricyclic antidepressant plasma levels. Similar effects have been reported with tobacco smoke. Research on the relationship of plasma level to therapeutic response with the[0m
[31mtricyclic antidepressants has produced conflicting results. While some studies report no correlation, many studies cite therapeutic levels for most tricyclics in the range of [0m[1;31m50[0m[31m to [0m[1;31m300[0m[31m nanograms per [0m
