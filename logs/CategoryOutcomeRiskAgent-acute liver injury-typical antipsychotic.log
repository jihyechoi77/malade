                Passages:
                1. Drug HALOPERIDOL: The FDA label for HALOPERIDOL does not specifically mention an increased risk of acute liver injury. However, it does note that impaired liver function and/or 
jaundice have been reported as adverse reactions. This indicates that there may be some impact on liver health, but the degree of risk or a direct causal relationship is not clearly established in the
label information.
2. Drug THIOTHIXENE: The FDA label for THIOTHIXENE does not specifically mention an increased risk of acute liver injury. However, it does indicate that liver damage has been reported with related 
drugs, and patients should be observed for signs of liver damage. The degree of risk specifically associated with thiothixene is not detailed in the label.
3. Drug PIMOZIDE: The FDA label for PIMOZIDE does not specifically mention an increased risk of acute liver injury. However, it does caution that PIMOZIDE should be administered cautiously to patients
with impaired liver function, indicating a potential for liver-related side effects. The degree of risk for acute liver injury specifically is not detailed in the FDA label.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for HALOPERIDOL mentions impaired liver function and/or jaundice as adverse reactions, suggesting some impact on liver health.
2. The FDA label for THIOTHIXENE indicates that liver damage has been reported with related drugs and advises observation for signs of liver damage, implying a potential risk.
3. The FDA label for PIMOZIDE advises caution in administering the drug to patients with impaired liver function, which suggests a concern for liver-related side effects.
4. None of the labels for HALOPERIDOL, THIOTHIXENE, or PIMOZIDE explicitly state an increased risk of acute liver injury, but they all contain language that suggests a potential for liver-related side
effects.
5. Given that all three drugs have some indication of potential liver-related side effects, it can be inferred that the typical antipsychotic category may have some association with an increased risk 
of acute liver injury.
        -----
        Final answer: The typical antipsychotic category of drugs may increase the risk of acute liver injury.
