CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: The following additional adverse reactions were previously reported with carbamazepine: Hemopoietic System: Aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, 
bone marrow depression, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, eosinophilia, acute intermittent porphyria. Skin: Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) (see BOXED 
WARNING ), Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP), pruritic and erythematous rashes, urticaria, photosensitivity reactions, alterations in skin pigmentation, exfoliative dermatitis, 
erythema multiforme and nodosum, purpura, aggravation of disseminated lupus erythematosus, alopecia, diaphoresis, onychomadesis and hirsutism. CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: In certain cases, 
discontinuation of therapy may be necessary. Cardiovascular System : Congestive heart failure, edema, aggravation of hypertension, hypotension, syncope and collapse, aggravation of coronary artery 
disease, arrhythmias and AV block, thrombophlebitis, thromboembolism, and adenopathy or lymphadenopathy. Some of these cardiovascular complications have resulted in fatalities. Myocardial infarction 
has been associated with other tricyclic compounds. Immune system disorders : Hypogammaglobulinemia. Liver : Abnormalities in liver function tests, cholestatic and hepatocellular jaundice, hepatitis, 
and hepatic failure. Pancreatic : Pancreatitis. Respiratory System: Pulmonary hypersensitivity characterized by fever, dyspnea, pneumonitis, or pneumonia. CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: 
Genitourinary System : Urinary frequency, acute urinary retention, oliguria with elevated blood pressure, azotemia, renal failure, and impotence. Albuminuria, glycosuria, elevated BUN, and microscopic
deposits in the urine have also been reported. There have been rare reports of impaired male fertility and/or abnormal spermatogenesis. Testicular atrophy occurred in rats receiving carbamazepine 
orally from 4 to 52 weeks at dosage levels of 50 to 400 mg/kg/day. Additionally, rats receiving carbamazepine in the diet for 2 years at dosage levels of 25, 75, and 250 mg/kg/day had a dose-related 
incidence of testicular atrophy and aspermatogenesis. In dogs, it produced a brownish discoloration, presumably a metabolite, in the urinary bladder at dosage levels of 50 mg/kg/day and higher. 
Relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: Nervous System : Dizziness, drowsiness, disturbances of coordination, confusion, headache, fatigue, blurred vision, 
visual hallucinations, transient diplopia, oculomotor disturbances, nystagmus, speech disturbances, abnormal involuntary movements, peripheral neuritis and paresthesias, depression with agitation, 
talkativeness, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. There have been reports of associated paralysis and other symptoms of cerebral arterial insufficiency, but the exact relationship of these reactions to the 
drug has not been established. Isolated cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome have been reported with concomitant use of psychotropic drugs. Digestive System : Nausea, vomiting, gastric distress and
abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, and dryness of the mouth and pharynx, including glossitis and stomatitis. Eyes: Scattered punctate cortical lens opacities, as well as conjunctivitis,
have been reported. CARBAMAZEPINE: adverse_reactions: Although a direct causal relationship has not been established, many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye changes. 
Musculoskeletal System: Bone loss, aching joints and muscles, and leg cramps. Metabolism : Fever and chills, decreased levels of plasma calcium leading to osteoporosis, and hyperammonemia have been 
reported. Other: Isolated cases of a lupus erythematosus-like syndrome have been reported. There have been occasional reports of elevated levels of cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in 
patients taking anticonvulsants. A case of aseptic meningitis, accompanied by myoclonus and peripheral eosinophilia, has been reported in a patient taking carbamazepine in combination with other 
medications. The patient was successfully dechallenged, and the meningitis reappeared upon rechallenge with carbamazepine.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: laboratory_tests: Laboratory Tests For genetically at-risk patients (see WARNINGS ), high-resolution ‘ HLA-B*1502 typing ’ is recommended. The test is positive if either one or
two HLA-B*1502 alleles are detected and negative if no HLA-B*1502 alleles are detected. Complete pretreatment blood counts, including platelets and possibly reticulocytes and serum iron, should be 
obtained as a baseline. If a patient in the course of treatment exhibits low or decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, the patient should be monitored closely. Discontinuation of the drug 
should be considered if any evidence of significant bone marrow depression develops. Baseline and periodic evaluations of liver function, particularly in patients with a history of liver disease, must
be performed during treatment with this drug since liver damage may occur (see PRECAUTIONS , General and ADVERSE REACTIONS , Liver ). CARBAMAZEPINE: laboratory_tests: Carbamazepine extended-release 
capsules should be discontinued based on clinical judgement, if indicated by newly occurring or worsening clinical or laboratory evidence of liver dysfunction or hepatic damage, or in the case of 
active liver disease. Baseline and periodic eye examinations, including slit-lamp, funduscopy, and tonometry, are recommended since many phenothiazines and related drugs have been shown to cause eye 
changes. Baseline and periodic complete urinalysis and BUN determinations are recommended for patients treated with this agent because of observed renal dysfunction. Increases in total cholesterol, 
LDL and HDL have been observed in some patients taking anticonvulsants. Therefore, periodic evaluation of these parameters is also recommended. Monitoring of blood levels (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) 
has increased the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants. This monitoring may be particularly useful in cases of dramatic increase in seizure frequency and for verification of compliance. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: laboratory_tests: In addition, measurement of drug serum levels may aid in determining the cause of toxicity when more than one medication is being used. Thyroid function tests have 
been reported to show decreased values with carbamazepine administered alone. Interference with some pregnancy tests has been reported.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole), cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, dalfopristin, danazol, dantrolene, delavirdine, diltiazem,
erythromycin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, ibuprofen, isoniazid, loratadine, macrolides, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, olanzapine, omeprazole, oxybutynin, protease inhibitors, 
propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, ticlopidine, troleandomycin, valproate, verapamil, zileuton. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Human microsomal epoxide hydrolase has been identified as the enzyme
responsible for the formation of the 10,11-transdiol derivative from carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide. Coadministration of inhibitors of human microsomal epoxide hydrolase may result in increased 
carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide plasma concentrations. Accordingly, the dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be adjusted and/or the plasma levels monitored when used concomitantly with
loxapine, quetiapine, or valproic acid. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these 
CYP3A4 or epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, it is reasonable to expect that a dose reduction for carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Agents that 
Induce Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes : Carbamazepine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the potential exists for interaction between carbamazepine and any agent that induces CYP3A4. Agents that are CYP
inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of carbamazepine extended-release capsules include, for example, the following: Aminophylline, cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, 
felbamate, fosphenytoin, methsuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin( 1 ), primidone, rifampin and theophylline. (1) Phenytoin plasma levels have also been reported to increase and decrease in the presence
of carbamazepine, see below. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on carbamazepine extended-release capsules, and then begins a course of treatment
with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be necessary. Agents with Decreased Levels in the Presence of 
Carbamazepine due to Induction of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: Carbamazepine is a potent inducer of hepatic CYP3A4 and is also known to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and may therefore reduce plasma
concentrations of co-medications mainly metabolized by CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and 3A4, through induction of their metabolism. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: When used concomitantly with carbamazepine
extended-release capsules, monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment of these agents may be necessary: When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be doubled. 
Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. If carbamazepine is later withdrawn, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When carbamazepine is used with tacrolimus, monitoring 
of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are recommended. The use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine should be avoided with temsirolimus. If 
patients must be coadministered carbamazepine with temsirolimus, an adjustment of temsirolimus dosage should be considered. The use of carbamazepine with lapatinib should generally be avoided. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: If carbamazepine is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up. If carbamazepine is discontinued, the 
lapatinib dose should be reduced. Concomitant use of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic 
effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monitor concentrations of valproate when carbamazepine extended-release capsules are introduced 
or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In addition, carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of, for example, the following drugs,
for which monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment may be necessary: Acetaminophen, albendazole, alprazolam, aprepitant, buprenorphine, apixaban( 6 ), bupropion, buspirone, citalopram, 
clobazam, clonazepam, clozapine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone), cyclosporin, dabigatran( 6 ), delavirdine, desipramine, diazepam, dicumarol, dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: felodipine), doxycycline, edoxaban( 6 ), eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, everolimus, felbamate, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, 
levothyroxine, lorazepam, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives( 2 ), oxcarbazepine, paliperidone, phenytoin( 3
), praziquantel, protease inhibitors, quetiapine, risperidone, rivaroxaban( 6 ), sertraline, sirolimus, tadalafil, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, triazolam, trazodone CARBAMAZEPINE: 
drug_interactions: ( 4 ), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin (5) , ziprasidone, and zonisamide. ( 2 ) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with
hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be 
decreased. Breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancies have been reported with carbamazepine. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered. ( 3 ) Phenytoin has also been 
reported to increase in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ( 4 ) 
Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine )
by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values. (5) Warfarin’s anticoagulant effect can be reduced in the presence of carbamazepine. (6) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban (direct acting oral anticoagulants) is expected to result in decreased plasma concentrations of these anticoagulants that may be insufficient to achieve
the intended therapeutic effect. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In general, coadministration of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban should be avoided. Thus, if a 
patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that 
a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary. Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine Carbamazepine extended-release capsules increase the plasma levels of the 
following agents. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules,
it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin( 7 ), and Primidone Carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules can increase the concentrations of clomipramine, phenytoin, and primidone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of these agents in this category, and then
begins treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these drugs. ( 7 )Phenytoin has also been reported to decrease in the presence of 
carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide is an inactive prodrug and is converted to its 
active metabolite in part by CYP3A. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide are reportedly increased by chronic co-administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers. There is a potential for increased cyclophosphamide toxicity when coadministered with carbamazepine. Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Carbamazepine: Delavirdine 
Coadministration of carbamazepine with delavirdine may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Lithium Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects. Thyroid Effects with Other Anticonvulsant Medications Alterations
of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Chloroquine and Mefloquine Anti-malarial drugs, such as 
chloroquine and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of carbamazepine. Thus if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of 
treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose adjustment may be necessary. CNS Depressants The concomitant use of carbamazepine extended-release 
capsules and other CNS depressants can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, hypotension, and syncope.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: WARNINGS Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), have been reported with carbamazepine treatment. The risk of these events is estimated to be about 1 to 6 per 10,000 new users in countries with mainly Caucasian populations. However, the risk 
in some Asian countries is estimated to be about 10 times higher. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not 
drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: SJS/TEN and HLA-B*1502 Allele 
Retrospective case-control studies have found that in patients of Chinese ancestry there is a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN with carbamazepine treatment and the presence of
an inherited variant of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B*1502. The occurrence of higher rates of these reactions in countries with higher frequencies of this allele suggests that the risk may be increased in 
allele-positive individuals of any ethnicity. Across Asian populations, notable variation exists in the prevalence of HLA-B*1502. Greater than 15% of the population is reported positive in Hong Kong, 
Thailand, Malaysia, and parts of the Philippines, compared to about 10% in Taiwan and 4% in North China. South Asians, including Indians, appear to have intermediate prevalence of HLA-B*1502, 
averaging 2 to 4%, but higher in some groups. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: HLA-B*1502 is present in <1% of the population in Japan and Korea. HLA-B*1502 is largely absent in individuals not of Asian 
origin (e.g., Caucasians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans). Prior to initiating carbamazepine extended-release capsules therapy, testing for HLA-B*1502 should be performed in 
patients with ancestry in populations in which HLA-B*1502 may be present. In deciding which patients to screen, the rates provided above for the prevalence of HLA-B*1502 may offer a rough guide, 
keeping in mind the limitations of these figures due to wide variability in rates even within ethnic groups, the difficulty in ascertaining ethnic ancestry, and the likelihood of mixed ancestry. 
Carbamazepine extended-release capsules should not be used in patients positive for HLA-B*1502 unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Tested patients who are found to
be negative for the allele are thought to have a low risk of SJS/TEN (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS/Laboratory Tests ). Over 90% of carbamazepine treated patients who will experience SJS/TEN have this 
reaction within the first few months of treatment. This information may be taken into consideration in determining the need for screening of genetically at-risk patients currently on carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules. The HLA-B*1502 allele has not been found to predict risk of less severe adverse cutaneous reactions from carbamazepine, such as maculopapular eruption [MPE] or to predict 
Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of 
Chinese ancestry taking other anti-epileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding use of other drugs associated with SJS/TEN in HLA-B*1502 
positive patients, when alternative therapies are otherwise equally acceptable. Patients should be made aware that carbamazepine extended-release capsules contain carbamazepine and should not be used 
in combination with any other medications containing carbamazepine. Hypersensitivity Reactions and HLA-A*3101 Allele Retrospective case-control studies in patients of European, Korean, and Japanese 
ancestry have found a moderate association between the risk of developing hypersensitivity reactions and the presence of HLA-A*3101, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-A gene, in patients using 
carbamazepine. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: These hypersensitivity reactions include SJS/TEN, maculopapular eruptions, and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (see DRESS/Multiorgan 
hypersensitivity below). HLA-A*3101 is expected to be carried by more than 15% of patients of Japanese, Native American, Southern Indian (e.g., Tamil Nadu) and some Arabic ancestry; up to about 10% in
patients of Han Chinese, Korean, European, Latin American and other Indian ancestry; and up to about 5% in African-Americans and patients of Thai, Taiwanese, and Chinese (Hong Kong) ancestry. The 
risks and benefits of carbamazepine therapy should be weighed before considering carbamazepine in patients known to be positive for HLA-A*3101. General Information on HLA Genotyping and 
Hypersensitivity Application of HLA genotyping as a screening tool has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management.

ANSWER: Carbamazepine has been reported to cause renal failure as an adverse reaction. Specifically, the adverse reactions section of the carbamazepine label lists "renal failure" under genitourinary 
system adverse reactions. Additionally, it mentions urinary frequency, acute urinary retention, oliguria with elevated blood pressure, azotemia, and other related issues. It is important to note that 
these are potential adverse reactions and do not necessarily occur in all patients taking carbamazepine.

The final answer to the question "Does CARBAMAZEPINE increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?" is that CARBAMAZEPINE has been reported to increase the risk of renal failure as an adverse 
reaction according to its drug label. However, it is important to note that this is a potential adverse reaction and does not necessarily occur in all patients taking the medication.
