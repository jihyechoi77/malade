CONTENT: WARFARIN: drug_interactions: 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, antibiotics, antifungals, botanical (herbal) products, and inhibitors and inducers of 
CYP2C9, 1A2, or 3A4. ( 7 ) Consult labeling of all concurrently used drugs for complete information about interactions with warfarin sodium or increased risks for bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 General 
Information Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired
hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic 
mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: It is important to note that some
drugs may interact by more than one mechanism. More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, 
including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [ see Boxed Warning ]. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information 
about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding. 7.2 CYP450 Interactions CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 
1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 
3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin. Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease
INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin. Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2 ; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. 
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, 
stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer. Table 2: Examples of 
CYP450 Interactions with Warfarin Enzyme Inhibitors Inducers CYP2C9 amiodarone, capecitabine, cotrimoxazole, etravirine, fluconazole, fluvastatin, fluvoxamine, metronidazole, miconazole, oxandrolone,

nafcillin, phenytoin, pioglitazone, prednisone, rifampin, rufinamide 7.3 Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk Examples of drugs known to increase the risk of bleeding are presented in Table 3 . WARFARIN:
drug_interactions: Because bleeding risk is increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin, closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin. WARFARIN: 
drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs that Can Increase the Risk of Bleeding Drug Class Specific Drugs Anticoagulants argatroban, dabigatran, bivalirudin, desirudin, heparin, lepirudin Antiplatelet Agents

paroxetine, sertraline, venlaf WARFARIN: drug_interactions: axine, vilazodone 7.4 Antibiotics and Antifungals There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or 
antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin. Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic 
or antifungal in patients taking warfarin. 7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals. Few adequate, 
well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with 
botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. Some botanicals 
may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be
expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium (e.g., co-enzyme Q 10 , St. John’s wort, ginseng). Some
botanicals and foods can interact with warfarin sodium through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John’s wort). The amount of vitamin K in food may affect 
therapy with warfarin sodium. Advise patients taking warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic 
changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: drug_interactions: 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk, antibiotics, antifungals, botanical (herbal) products, and inhibitors and inducers of 
CYP2C9, 1A2, or 3A4. ( 7 ) Consult labeling of all concurrently used drugs for complete information about interactions with warfarin sodium or increased risks for bleeding. ( 7 ) 7.1 General 
Information Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired
hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic 
mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: It is important to note that some
drugs may interact by more than one mechanism. More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, 
including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [ see Boxed Warning ]. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information 
about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding. 7.2 CYP450 Interactions CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 
1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin S -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R -enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 
3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin. Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease
INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin. Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in Table 2 ; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. 
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, 
stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer. Table 2: Examples of

drug_interactions: Because bleeding risk is increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin, closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin. WARFARIN: 
drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs that Can Increase the Risk of Bleeding Drug Class Specific Drugs Anticoagulants argatroban, dabigatran, bivalirudin, desirudin, heparin, lepirudin Antiplatelet Agents

paroxetine, sertraline, venlaf WARFARIN: drug_interactions: axine, vilazodone 7.4 Antibiotics and Antifungals There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or 
antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin. Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic 
or antifungal in patients taking warfarin. 7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals. Few adequate, 
well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with 
botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. Some botanicals 
may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g. WARFARIN: drug_interactions: garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be
expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium (e.g., co-enzyme Q 10 , St. John’s wort, ginseng). Some
botanicals and foods can interact with warfarin sodium through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John’s wort). The amount of vitamin K in food may affect 
therapy with warfarin sodium. Advise patients taking warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic 
changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: information_for_patients: 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Instructions for Patients Advise 
patients to: Strictly adhere to the prescribed dosage schedule  . If the prescribed dose of warfarin sodium is missed, take the dose as soon as possible on the same day but do not take a double dose 
of warfarin sodium the next day to make up for missed doses  . Obtain prothrombin time tests and make regular visits to their physician or clinic to monitor therapy  . Be aware that if therapy with 
warfarin sodium is discontinued, the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium may persist for about 2 to 5 days  . WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Avoid any activity or sport that may result in 
traumatic injury  . And to tell their physician if they fall often as this may increase their risk for complications. Eat a normal, balanced diet to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K. Avoid 
drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of leafy, green vegetables  . Contact their physician to report any serious illness, such as severe diarrhea, infection, or fever  . 
Immediately contact their physician when experiencing pain and discoloration of the skin (a purple bruise like rash) mostly on areas of the body with a high fat content, such as breasts, thighs, 
buttocks, hips and abdomen [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]. WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Immediately contact their physician when experiencing any unusual symptom or pain since 
warfarin sodium may cause small cholesterol or athero emboli. On feet it may appear as a sudden cool, painful, purple discoloration of toe(s) or forefoot [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) ]. 
Immediately contact their physician when taking warfarin sodium after any heparin formulation therapy and experiencing bloody or black stools or appearence of bruises, or bleeding [ see Warnings and 
Precautions ( 5.6 ) ]. To tell all of their healthcare professionals and dentists that they are taking warfarin sodium. This should be done before they have any surgery or dental procedure [ see 
Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 ) ]. Carry identification stating that they are taking warfarin sodium. Bleeding Risks Advise patients to: Notify their physician immediately if any unusual bleeding or
symptoms occur. WARFARIN: information_for_patients: Signs and symptoms of bleeding include: pain, swelling or discomfort, prolonged bleeding from cuts, increased menstrual flow or vaginal bleeding,

CONTENT: WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Individualize dosing regimen for each patient, and adjust based on INR response. ( 2.1 , 2.2 ) Knowledge of genotype can 
inform initial dose selection. ( 2.3 ) Monitoring: Obtain daily INR determinations upon initiation until stable in the therapeutic range. Obtain subsequent INR determinations every 1 to 4 weeks. ( 2.4
) Review conversion instructions from other anticoagulants. ( 2.8 ) 2.1 Individualized Dosing The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according
to the patient’s International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient’s INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical 
practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions. 2. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for 
Individual Indications An INR of greater than 4 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding. Venous Thromboembolism 
(including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE) Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2 to 3) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the 
indication as follows: For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended. For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, 
treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient. WARFARIN: 
dosage_and_administration: For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, 
periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient. Atrial Fibrillation In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 
2.5 (range, 2 to 3). In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at high risk of stroke (i.e., having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic
attack, or systemic embolism, or 2 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart failure, history of 
hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: In patients with non-valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and 
at an intermediate risk of ischemic stroke (i.e., having 1 of the following risk factors: age greater than 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or heart 
failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended. For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is 
recommended. For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, long-term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended; the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and 
position, and on patient factors. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves For patients with a bileaflet mechanical valve or a Medtronic Hall (Minneapolis, MN) 
tilting disk valve in the aortic position who are in sinus rhythm and without left atrial enlargement, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2.5 (range, 2 to 3) is recommended. For patients with 
tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) is recommended. For patients with caged ball or caged disk 
valves, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3 (range, 2.5 to 3.5) is recommended. For patients with a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position, therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2.

mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the decision to initiate or continue warfarin sodium should be reviewed with the patient, taking into 
consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient’s medical situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes
a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug 
is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus  . 5. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 8 Other 
Clinical Settings with Increased Risks In the following clinical settings, the risks of warfarin sodium therapy may be increased: Moderate to severe hepatic impairment Infectious diseases or 
disturbances of intestinal flora (e.g., sprue, antibiotic therapy) Use of an indwelling catheter Severe to moderate hypertension Deficiency in protein C-mediated anticoagulant response: Warfarin 
sodium reduces the synthesis of the naturally occurring anticoagulants, protein C and protein S. Hereditary or acquired deficiencies of protein C or its cofactor, protein S, have been associated with 
tissue necrosis following warfarin administration. Concomitant anticoagulation therapy with heparin for 5 to 7 days during initiation of therapy with warfarin sodium may minimize the incidence of 
tissue necrosis in these patients. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Eye surgery: In cataract surgery, warfarin sodium use was associated with a significant increase in minor complications of sharp 
needle and local anesthesia block but not associated with potentially sight-threatening operative hemorrhagic complications. As warfarin sodium cessation or reduction may lead to serious 
thromboembolic complications, the decision to discontinue warfarin sodium before a relatively less invasive and complex eye surgery, such as lens surgery, should be based upon the risks of 
anticoagulant therapy weighed against the benefits. Polycythemia vera Vasculitis Diabetes mellitus 5.9 Endogenous Factors Affecting INR The following factors may be responsible for increased INR 
response: diarrhea, hepatic disorders, poor nutritional state, steatorrhea, or vitamin K deficiency. The following factors may be responsible for decreased INR response: increased vitamin K intake or 
hereditary warfarin resistance.

        Question: Does WARFARIN increase or decrease the risk of hip fracture?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I attempted to retrieve information from FDAHandler regarding the effect of warfarin on the risk of hip fracture.
2. FDAHandler consistently responded with 'DO-NOT-KNOW,' indicating that the FDA label for warfarin does not contain information about its impact on the risk of hip fracture.
        -----
        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for warfarin does not contain information about its impact on the risk of hip fracture, as indicated by the consistent "DO-NOT-KNOW" responses from FDAHandler. Therefore, I cannot 
provide a definitive answer on whether warfarin increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture.
