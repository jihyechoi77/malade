CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE ABELCET ® is indicated for the treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of 
conventional amphotericin B therapy. This is based on open-label treatment of patients judged by their physicians to be intolerant to or failing conventional amphotericin B therapy (See DESCRIPTION OF
CLINICAL STUDIES). DESCRIPTION OF CLINICAL STUDIES Fungal Infections Data from 473 patients were pooled from three open-label studies in which ABELCET ® was provided for the treatment of patients with
invasive fungal infections who were judged by their physicians to be refractory to or intolerant of conventional amphotericin B, or who had preexisting nephrotoxicity. Results of these studies 
demonstrated effectiveness of ABELCET ® in the treatment of invasive fungal infections as a second line therapy. AMPHOTERICIN B: indications_and_usage: Patients were defined by their individual 
physician as being refractory to or failing conventional amphotericin B therapy based on overall clinical judgement after receiving a minimum total dose of 500 mg of amphotericin B. Nephrotoxicity was
defined as a serum creatinine that had increased to >2.5 mg/dL in adults and >1.5 mg/dL in pediatric patients, or a creatinine clearance of <25 mL/min while receiving conventional amphotericin B 
therapy. Of the 473 patients, four were enrolled more than once; each enrollment contributed separately to the denominator. The median age was 39 years (range of <1 to 93 years); 307 patients were 
male and 166 female. Patients were Caucasian (381, 81%), African-American (41, 9%), Hispanic (27, 6%), Asian (10, 2%), and various other races (14, 3%). AMPHOTERICIN B: indications_and_usage: The 
median baseline neutrophil count was 4,000 PMN/mm3; of these, 101 (21%) had a baseline neutrophil count <500/mm 3 . Two-hundred eighty-two patients of the 473 patients were considered evaluable for 
response to therapy; the other 191 patients were excluded on the basis of unconfirmed diagnosis, confounding factors, concomitant systemic antifungal therapy, or receiving 4 doses or less of ABELCET ®
. For evaluable patients, the following fungal infections were treated (n=282): aspergillosis (n=111), candidiasis (n=87), zygomycosis (n=25), cryptococcosis (n=16), and fusariosis (n=11). There were 
fewer than 10 evaluable patients for each of several other fungal species treated. For each type of fungal infection listed above there were some patients successfully treated. AMPHOTERICIN B: 
indications_and_usage: However, in the absence of controlled studies it is unknown how response would have compared to either continuing conventional amphotericin B therapy or the use of alternative 
antifungal agents. Renal Function: Patients with aspergillosis who initiated treatment with ABELCET ® when serum creatinine was above 2.5 mg/dL experienced a decline in serum creatinine during 
treatment (Figure 1). Serum creatinine levels were also lower during treatment with ABELCET ® when compared to the serum creatinine levels of patients treated with conventional amphotericin B in a 
retrospective historical control study. Meaningful statistical testing of the differences between these two groups is precluded since these data were obtained from two separate studies. [ ]= Number of
patients at each time point. Note: These curves do not represent the clinical course of a given patient, but that of an open-label cohort of patients. [ ]= Number of patients at each time point.

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics The assay used to measure amphotericin B in the blood after the administration of ABELCET ® does not distinguish 
amphotericin B that is complexed with the phospholipids of ABELCET ® from amphotericin B that is uncomplexed. The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B after the administration of ABELCET ® are 
nonlinear. Volume of distribution and clearance from blood increase with increasing dose of ABELCET ® , resulting in less than proportional increases in blood concentrations of amphotericin B over a 
dose range of 0.6-5 mg/kg/day. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B in whole blood after the administration of ABELCET ® and amphotericin B desoxycholate are: 
Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Amphotericin B in Whole Blood in Patients Administered Multiple Doses of ABELCET ® or Amphotericin B Desoxycholate Pharmacokinetic Parameter ABELCET ® 5 mg/kg/day for 5-7

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: Although amphotericin B is excreted slowly, there is little accumulation in the blood after repeated dosing. AUC of amphotericin B increased 
approximately 34% from day 1 after the administration of ABELCET ® 5 mg/kg/day for 7 days. The effect of gender or ethnicity on the pharmacokinetics of ABELCET ® has not been studied. Tissue 
concentrations of amphotericin B have been obtained at autopsy from one heart transplant patient who received three doses of ABELCET ® at 5.3 mg/kg/day: Concentration in Human Tissues Organ 
Amphotericin B Tissue Concentration (µg/g) Spleen 290.0 Lung 222.0 Liver 196.0 Lymph Node 7.6 Kidney 6.9 Heart 0 5. Brain 1. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: 6 This pattern of distribution is 
consistent with that observed in preclinical studies in dogs in which greatest concentrations of amphotericin B after ABELCET ® administration were observed in the liver, spleen, and lung; however, 
the relationship of tissue concentrations of amphotericin B to its biological activity when administered as ABELCET ® is unknown. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic 
impairment on the disposition of ABELCET ® is not known. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of ABELCET ® is not known. The effect of dialysis on the elimination of 
ABELCET ® has not been studied; however, amphotericin B is not removed by hemodialysis when administered as amphotericin B desoxycholate. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: Pediatric and Elderly 
Patients: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pediatric patients (≤16 years of age) and elderly patients (≥65 years of age) have not been studied.

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE ABELCET ® is indicated for the treatment of invasive fungal infections in patients who are refractory to or intolerant of 
conventional amphotericin B therapy. This is based on open-label treatment of patients judged by their physicians to be intolerant to or failing conventional amphotericin B therapy (See DESCRIPTION OF
CLINICAL STUDIES). DESCRIPTION OF CLINICAL STUDIES Fungal Infections Data from 473 patients were pooled from three open-label studies in which ABELCET ® was provided for the treatment of patients with
invasive fungal infections who were judged by their physicians to be refractory to or intolerant of conventional amphotericin B, or who had preexisting nephrotoxicity. Results of these studies 
demonstrated effectiveness of ABELCET ® in the treatment of invasive fungal infections as a second line therapy. AMPHOTERICIN B: indications_and_usage: Patients were defined by their individual 
physician as being refractory to or failing conventional amphotericin B therapy based on overall clinical judgement after receiving a minimum total dose of 500 mg of amphotericin B. Nephrotoxicity was
defined as a serum creatinine that had increased to >2.5 mg/dL in adults and >1.5 mg/dL in pediatric patients, or a creatinine clearance of <25 mL/min while receiving conventional amphotericin B 
therapy. Of the 473 patients, four were enrolled more than once; each enrollment contributed separately to the denominator. The median age was 39 years (range of <1 to 93 years); 307 patients were 
male and 166 female. Patients were Caucasian (381, 81%), African-American (41, 9%), Hispanic (27, 6%), Asian (10, 2%), and various other races (14, 3%). AMPHOTERICIN B: indications_and_usage: The 
median baseline neutrophil count was 4,000 PMN/mm3; of these, 101 (21%) had a baseline neutrophil count <500/mm 3 . Two-hundred eighty-two patients of the 473 patients were considered evaluable for 
response to therapy; the other 191 patients were excluded on the basis of unconfirmed diagnosis, confounding factors, concomitant systemic antifungal therapy, or receiving 4 doses or less of ABELCET ®
. For evaluable patients, the following fungal infections were treated (n=282): aspergillosis (n=111), candidiasis (n=87), zygomycosis (n=25), cryptococcosis (n=16), and fusariosis (n=11). There were 
fewer than 10 evaluable patients for each of several other fungal species treated. For each type of fungal infection listed above there were some patients successfully treated. AMPHOTERICIN B: 
indications_and_usage: However, in the absence of controlled studies it is unknown how response would have compared to either continuing conventional amphotericin B therapy or the use of alternative 
antifungal agents. Renal Function: Patients with aspergillosis who initiated treatment with ABELCET ® when serum creatinine was above 2.5 mg/dL experienced a decline in serum creatinine during 
treatment (Figure 1). Serum creatinine levels were also lower during treatment with ABELCET ® when compared to the serum creatinine levels of patients treated with conventional amphotericin B in a 
retrospective historical control study. Meaningful statistical testing of the differences between these two groups is precluded since these data were obtained from two separate studies. [ ]= Number of
patients at each time point. Note: These curves do not represent the clinical course of a given patient, but that of an open-label cohort of patients. [ ]= Number of patients at each time point.

concentrations of amphotericin B have been obtained at autopsy from one heart transplant patient who received three doses of ABELCET ® at 5.3 mg/kg/day: Concentration in Human Tissues Organ 
Amphotericin B Tissue Concentration (µg/g) Spleen 290.0 Lung 222.0 Liver 196.0 Lymph Node 7.6 Kidney 6.9 Heart 0 5. Brain 1. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: 6 This pattern of distribution is 
consistent with that observed in preclinical studies in dogs in which greatest concentrations of amphotericin B after ABELCET ® administration were observed in the liver, spleen, and lung; however, 
the relationship of tissue concentrations of amphotericin B to its biological activity when administered as ABELCET ® is unknown. Special Populations Hepatic Impairment: The effect of hepatic 
impairment on the disposition of ABELCET ® is not known. Renal Impairment: The effect of renal impairment on the disposition of ABELCET ® is not known. The effect of dialysis on the elimination of 
ABELCET ® has not been studied; however, amphotericin B is not removed by hemodialysis when administered as amphotericin B desoxycholate. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: Pediatric and Elderly 
Patients: The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pediatric patients (≤16 years of age) and elderly patients (≥65 years of age) have not been studied.

The FDA label data does not specify whether Amphotericin B increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable answer to this question 
based on the available data.
