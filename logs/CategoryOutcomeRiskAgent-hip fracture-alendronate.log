                Passages:
                1. Drug ALENDRONATE SODIUM: ALENDRONATE SODIUM decreases the risk of hip fracture. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which indicates that ALENDRONATE SODIUM is 
used for the treatment of osteoporosis and works by inhibiting osteoclast activity, leading to an increase in bone mass and a reduction in the incidence of fractures, including hip fractures.
2. Drug ALENDRONATE: Alendronate decreases the risk of hip fracture. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which states that Alendronate is indicated for the treatment of 
osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis. It inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, reducing bone resorption without directly affecting bone formation. 
Clinical studies have shown that Alendronate sodium increases bone mass and reduces the incidence of fractures, including those of the hip and spine.
                ---------
                Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of
                hip fracture, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of hip fracture, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Both passages provided discuss drugs within the alendronate category.
2. Passage 1 states that ALENDRONATE SODIUM decreases the risk of hip fracture by inhibiting osteoclast activity, leading to an increase in bone mass and a reduction in the incidence of fractures.
3. Passage 2 confirms that Alendronate also decreases the risk of hip fracture by inhibiting osteoclast activity, which reduces bone resorption and has been clinically shown to increase bone mass and 
reduce the incidence of fractures, including hip fractures.
4. The information provided is consistent across both passages and indicates a clear effect of the alendronate category of drugs on decreasing the risk of hip fracture.
        -----
        Final answer: The alendronate category of drugs decreases the risk of hip fracture.
