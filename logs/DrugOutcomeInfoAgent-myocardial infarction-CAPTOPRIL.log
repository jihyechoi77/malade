[31mthe drug. Renin, an enzyme synthesized by the kidneys, is released into the circulation where it acts on a plasma globulin substrate to produce angiotensin I, a relatively inactive decapeptide. [0m
[31mAngiotensin I is then converted by angiotensin converting enzyme [0m[1;31m([0m[31mACE[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m to angiotensin II, a potent endogenous vasoconstrictor substance. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion from the [0m
[31madrenal cortex, thereby contributing to sodium and fluid retention. CAPTOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Captopril prevents the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibition of ACE, a [0m
[31mpeptidyldipeptide carboxy hydrolase. This inhibition has been demonstrated in both healthy human subjects and in animals by showing that the elevation of blood pressure caused by exogenously [0m
[31madministered angiotensin I was attenuated or abolished by captopril. In animal studies, captopril did not alter the pressor responses to a number of other agents, including angiotensin II and [0m
