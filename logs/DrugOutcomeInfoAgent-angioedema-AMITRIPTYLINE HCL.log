[31mtreated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the [0m
[31minitial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, [0m

[31mdepressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or [0m
[31mthe emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Consideration should be [0m
[31mgiven to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms[0m
[31mthat might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient’s presenting symptoms. Families and [0m
[31mcaregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients [0m
[31mfor the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to [0m
[31mhealth care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for amitriptyline hydrochloride should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets[0m
[31mconsistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder A major depressive episode may be the initial [0m
[31mpresentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed [0m[1;31m([0m[31mthough not established in controlled trials[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m that treating such an episode with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of [0m
[31mprecipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to initiating [0m
[31mtreatment with an antidepressant, patients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed [0m
[31mpsychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted that amitriptyline hydrochloride is not approved for use in treating bipolar [0m
[31mdepression. Amitriptyline hydrochloride may block the antihypertensive action of guanethidine or similarly acting compounds. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: It should be used with caution in patients [0m
[31mwith a history of seizures and, because of its atropine-like action, in patients with a history of urinary retention, angle-closure glaucoma or increased intraocular pressure. In patients with [0m
[31mangle-closure glaucoma, even average doses may precipitate an attack. Patients with cardiovascular disorders should be watched closely. Tricyclic antidepressant drugs, including amitriptyline [0m
[31mhydrochloride, particularly when given in high doses, have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, and prolongation of the conduction time. Myocardial infarction and stroke have been [0m
[31mreported with drugs of this class. Close supervision is required when amitriptyline hydrochloride is given to hyperthyroid patients or those receiving thyroid medication. Amitriptyline may enhance the[0m
[31mresponse to alcohol and the effects of barbiturates and other CNS depressants. AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: warnings: In patients who may use alcohol excessively, it should be borne in mind that the [0m
