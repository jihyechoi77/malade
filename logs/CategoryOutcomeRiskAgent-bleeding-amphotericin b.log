                Passages:
                1. Drug AMBISOME: AMBISOME may increase the risk of bleeding due to its association with thrombocytopenia and the listing of hemorrhage as an adverse event. This information is based 
on the AMBISOME label, which reports thrombocytopenia as a condition that can increase the risk of bleeding and lists hemorrhage as a cardiovascular adverse event and gum/oral hemorrhage under 
digestive system adverse events.
2. Drug AMPHOTERICIN B: Amphotericin B has been reported to increase the risk of bleeding, specifically causing gastrointestinal hemorrhage, with an incidence of 4% among patients treated with it.
3. Drug ABELCET: The final answer to the question "Does ABELCET increase or decrease the risk of bleeding?" is that ABELCET has been reported to cause gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which is a type of 
bleeding, in 4% of patients based on a safety data base of 556 patients. However, the causal relationship between ABELCET and the occurrence of bleeding is uncertain. Therefore, it cannot be 
definitively stated that ABELCET increases the risk of bleeding with a high degree of reliability.

                bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the amphotericin b category of drugs increase the risk of bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that AMBISOME may increase the risk of bleeding due to its association with thrombocytopenia and the listing of hemorrhage as an adverse event.
2. Passage 2 reports that Amphotericin B has been associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, with an incidence of 4%.
3. Passage 3 suggests that ABELCET has been reported to cause gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 4% of patients, but the causal relationship is uncertain.
4. Based on the information provided, two of the drugs in the amphotericin b category (AMBISOME and Amphotericin B) have been associated with an increased risk of bleeding, while the third (ABELCET) 
has reported bleeding events but with uncertain causality.
5. Overall, the evidence suggests that the amphotericin b category of drugs is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, although the strength of the association may vary among individual drugs.
        -----
        Final answer: The amphotericin b category of drugs increases the risk of bleeding.
