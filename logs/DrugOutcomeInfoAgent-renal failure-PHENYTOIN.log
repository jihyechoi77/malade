CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using 
alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of 
intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as “purple glove syndrome”) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin 
injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms 
may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 
Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the 
administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile 
saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and 
abscess formation at the injection site  . 5. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with
renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view 
of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other 
Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other 
adverse developmental outcomes  . PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of 
fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among 
children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including 
neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This 
drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's 
inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. PHENYTOIN: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above 
Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as "delirium", "psychosis", or "encephalopathy", or rarely irreversible 
cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if 
serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.         
SOURCE:PHENYTOIN label


CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: pharmacokinetics: As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one
week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IM dose is increased by 50 percent over the 
previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half 
of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of 
toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). PHENYTOIN: pharmacokinetics: Distribution Phenytoin is 
extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin 
is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of 
phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease 
with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). PHENYTOIN: pharmacokinetics: Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in 
elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required . S e x /Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction
of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. P regnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of 
phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies 
Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. PHENYTOIN: pharmacokinetics: Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing 
enzymes  .         
SOURCE:PHENYTOIN label


CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to 
sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when 
possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin 
at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations 
may increase modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50
mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered
intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the 
slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms . Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. 
Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form 
over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt 
and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those
with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly 
patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required . 2. PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: 7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy 
because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted
as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels 
should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin 
within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). PHENYTOIN: dosage_and_administration: The drug should be injected
slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower.

CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse 
developmental outcomes. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure 
Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are 
advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 
1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . 
Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an 
increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial 
features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in 
combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy  . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during 
pregnancy. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental 
toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk
of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic 
measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage  . However, postpartum restoration of the original 
dosage will probably be indicated. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin 
K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the 
neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in 
children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern 
of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies.         
SOURCE:PHENYTOIN label


CONTENT: PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, 
and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 
75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s 
clinical need for Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8. PHENYTOIN: 
use_in_specific_populations: 4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally 
accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with 
rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin 
clearance tends to decrease with increasing age  . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required . 8. PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: 6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The 
liver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is 
increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in 
Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g.,*1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared
to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1 ). PHENYTOIN: use_in_specific_populations: Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses 
of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should 
be checked immediately  .

ANSWER: The provided extracts from the PHENYTOIN label do not directly address the question of whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. However, it is mentioned that the 
fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, and that monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound 
fraction in these patients. This suggests that there is a consideration for altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment, but it does not specify an increase or decrease in the
risk of renal failure due to phenytoin use.

The question was whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. After consulting with FDAHandler, the information provided from the PHENYTOIN label does not directly address the 
risk of renal failure associated with the use of PHENYTOIN. The label mentions that the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with 
hypoalbuminemia, and that monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in these patients. This indicates that there is a consideration for altered phenytoin 
pharmacokinetics in patients with renal impairment, but it does not specify whether PHENYTOIN use increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, we do not 
have a definitive answer to this question.
