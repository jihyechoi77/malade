                1. Drug METOPROLOL TARTRATE: I apologize for the confusion earlier. I have now received the response from FDAHandler regarding the effect of Metoprolol Tartrate on the risk of hip 
fracture. The FDAHandler indicated that the FDA label for Metoprolol Tartrate does not specify information about the drug's effect on the risk of hip fracture. Therefore, based on the available FDA 
label data, we cannot determine whether Metoprolol Tartrate increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture.

 DO-NOT-KNOW
2. Drug LABETALOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether LABETALOL increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. I consulted FDAHandler to inquire about this specific effect of LABETALOL. FDAHandler's response was DO-NOT-KNOW, 
which indicates that the FDA label for LABETALOL does not contain information regarding its effect on the risk of hip fracture. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine 
whether LABETALOL has an effect on the risk of hip fracture.
3. Drug ATENOLOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ATENOLOL does not contain information regarding its effect on the risk of hip fracture, hence there is no known increase or decrease in risk associated with ATENOLOL based on FDA 
label data.

                Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of
                hip fracture, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of hip fracture, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passages provided do not contain specific information about the effect of beta blockers on the risk of hip fracture.
2. For Metoprolol Tartrate, Labetalol, and Atenolol, the FDA labels do not specify whether they increase or decrease the risk of hip fracture.
3. Without specific data or evidence from the FDA labels for these drugs, we cannot determine the effect of the beta blocker category on hip fracture risk.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the beta blocker category of drugs on the risk of hip fracture based on the information provided.
