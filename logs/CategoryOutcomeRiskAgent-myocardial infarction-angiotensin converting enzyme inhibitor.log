                Passages:
                1. Drug LISINOPRIL: LISINOPRIL is associated with a decrease in the risk of myocardial infarction as part of its blood pressure-lowering effects. Controlled trials of antihypertensive 
drugs, including lisinopril, have regularly shown reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality.
2. Drug CAPTOPRIL: The question was whether CAPTOPRIL increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, CAPTOPRIL has been reported to cause 
myocardial infarction in approximately 2 to 3 out of 1000 patients, which is considered a relatively low incidence. This data comes from clinical trials involving around 7000 patients. However, it is 
important to note that the causal relationship between CAPTOPRIL and myocardial infarction is uncertain. Therefore, while there is a reported incidence of myocardial infarction in patients taking 
CAPTOPRIL, it cannot be definitively stated that CAPTOPRIL increases the risk due to the uncertainty of the causal relationship.
3. Drug ENALAPRIL MALEATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDAHandler provided information on the clinical pharmacology of ENALAPRIL MALEATE, indicating its use in the treatment of hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, and asymptomatic left 
ventricular dysfunction. It works by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which can lower blood pressure and benefit heart failure patients. However, the FDAHandler response did not 
directly address the risk of myocardial infarction associated with ENALAPRIL MALEATE. Therefore, based on the information provided, we do not know whether ENALAPRIL MALEATE increases or decreases the 
risk of myocardial infarction.

        Question: Does the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs increase the risk of myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. Passage 1 indicates that LISINOPRIL, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, is associated with a decrease in the risk of myocardial infarction due to its blood pressure-lowering 
effects. Controlled trials have shown reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality with the use of lisinopril.
2. Passage 2 mentions that CAPTOPRIL has been reported to cause myocardial infarction in a small number of patients (2 to 3 out of 1000), but the causal relationship is uncertain. This suggests that 
while there is a reported incidence, it is not clear if CAPTOPRIL actually increases the risk of myocardial infarction.
3. Passage 3 does not provide information on whether ENALAPRIL MALEATE increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction, leaving its effect on myocardial infarction risk unknown.
4. Based on the available information, there is evidence that at least one drug in the category (LISINOPRIL) decreases the risk of myocardial infarction, while the effect of another (CAPTOPRIL) is 
uncertain, and there is no information on the third (ENALAPRIL MALEATE).
        -----
        Final answer: The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs does not have a clear overall effect on the risk of myocardial infarction, as the evidence suggests a decrease for 
one drug, uncertainty for another, and no information for the third.
