Clinical Laboratory Values The effect of Am B isome on renal and hepatic function and on serum electrolytes was assessed from laboratory values measured repeatedly in Study 94-0-002. The frequency and
magnitude of hepatic test abnormalities were similar in the Am B isome and amphotericin B groups. Nephrotoxicity was defined as creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in 
pediatric patients, and creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in adult patients, provided the peak creatinine concentration was > 1.2 mg/dL. Hypokalemia was defined as 
potassium levels ≤ 2.5 mmol/L any time during treatment. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Incidence of nephrotoxicity, mean peak serum creatinine concentration, mean change from baseline in serum 
creatinine, and incidence of hypokalemia in the double-blind, randomized study were lower in the Am B isome group as summarized in the following table: Study 94-0-002 Laboratory Evidence of

reports of flushing, back pain with or without chest tightness, and chest pain associated with Am B isome administration; on occasion this has been severe. Where these symptoms were noted, the 
reaction developed within a few minutes after the start of infusion and disappeared rapidly when the infusion was stopped. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: The symptoms do not occur with every dose and 
usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse 
events also have been reported in 2% to 10% of Am B isome-treated patients receiving chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, or who had HIV disease in six comparative, clinical trials: Body as a

isome was well tolerated. Am B isome had a lower incidence of chills, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, hypokalemia, and various events related to decreased kidney function as compared 
to amphotericin B deoxycholate. In pediatric patients (16 years of age or less) in this double-blind study, Am B isome compared to amphotericin B deoxycholate, had a lower incidence of hypokalemia 
(37% versus 55%), chills (29% versus 68%), vomiting (27% versus 55%), and hypertension (10% versus 21%). AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Similar trends, although with a somewhat lower incidence, were 
observed in open-label, randomized Study 104-14 involving 205 febrile neutropenic pediatric patients (141 treated with Am B isome and 64 treated with amphotericin B deoxycholate). Pediatric patients 
appear to have more tolerance than older individuals for the nephrotoxic effects of amphotericin B deoxycholate. The following adverse events are based on the experience of 244 patients (202 adult and
42 pediatric patients) of whom 85 patients were treated with Am B isome 3 mg/kg, 81 patients were treated with Am B isome 5 mg/kg and 78 patients were treated with amphotericin B lipid complex 5 mg/kg

CONTENT: AMBISOME: clinical_studies: The following table presents a comparison of efficacy rates among immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients infected in the Mediterranean basin who had no 
prior treatment or remote prior treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. Efficacy is expressed as both acute parasite clearance at the end of therapy (EOT) and as overall success (clearance with no 
relapse) during the follow-up period (F/U) of greater than 6 months for immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients: AmBisome Efficacy in Visceral Leishmaniasis Immunocompetent Patients No. of

followed for 6 months or more after treatment, the overall success rate among immunocompetent patients was 96.5% and the overall success rate among immunocompromised patients was 11.8% due to relapse 
in the majority of patients. While case reports have suggested there may be a role for long-term therapy to prevent relapses in HIV coinfected patients (Lopez-Dupla, et al. AMBISOME: clinical_studies:
J Antimicrob Chemother 1993; 32: 657-659), there are no data to date documenting the efficacy or safety of repeat courses of Am B isome or of maintenance therapy with this drug among immunocompromised
patients.

usually do not recur on subsequent administrations when the infusion rate is slowed. Toxicity and Discontinuation of Dosing In Study 94-0-002, a significantly lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
was observed in the Am B isome group compared with the amphotericin B group. In addition, nearly three times as many patients administered amphotericin B required a reduction in dose due to toxicity 
or discontinuation of study drug due to an infusion-related reaction compared with those administered Am B isome. In empirical therapy study 97-0-034, a greater proportion of patients in the 
amphotericin B lipid complex group discontinued the study drug due to an adverse event than in the Am B isome groups. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Less Common Adverse Events The following adverse

Clinical Laboratory Values The effect of Am B isome on renal and hepatic function and on serum electrolytes was assessed from laboratory values measured repeatedly in Study 94-0-002. The frequency and
magnitude of hepatic test abnormalities were similar in the Am B isome and amphotericin B groups. Nephrotoxicity was defined as creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in 
pediatric patients, and creatinine values increasing 100% or more over pretreatment levels in adult patients, provided the peak creatinine concentration was > 1.2 mg/dL. Hypokalemia was defined as 
potassium levels ≤ 2.5 mmol/L any time during treatment. AMBISOME: adverse_reactions: Incidence of nephrotoxicity, mean peak serum creatinine concentration, mean change from baseline in serum 
creatinine, and incidence of hypokalemia in the double-blind, randomized study were lower in the Am B isome group as summarized in the following table: Study 94-0-002 Laboratory Evidence of

prior treatment or remote prior treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. Efficacy is expressed as both acute parasite clearance at the end of therapy (EOT) and as overall success (clearance with no 
relapse) during the follow-up period (F/U) of greater than 6 months for immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients: AmBisome Efficacy in Visceral Leishmaniasis Immunocompetent Patients No. of 
Patients Parasite (%) Clearance at EOT Overall Success (%) at F/U 87 86/87 (98.9) 83/86 (96.5) Immunocompromised Patients Regimen Total Dose Parasite (%) Clearance at EOT Overall Success (%) at F/U 
100 mg/day X 21 days 29-38. AMBISOME: clinical_studies: 9 mg/kg 10/10 (100) 2/10 (20) 4 mg/kg/day, days 1-5, and 10, 17, 24, 31, 38 40 mg/kg 8/9 (88.9) 0/7 (0) TOTAL 18/19 (94.7) 2/17 (11.8) When 
followed for 6 months or more after treatment, the overall success rate among immunocompetent patients was 96.5% and the overall success rate among immunocompromised patients was 11.8% due to relapse 
in the majority of patients. While case reports have suggested there may be a role for long-term therapy to prevent relapses in HIV coinfected patients (Lopez-Dupla, et al. AMBISOME: clinical_studies:
J Antimicrob Chemother 1993; 32: 657-659), there are no data to date documenting the efficacy or safety of repeat courses of Am B isome or of maintenance therapy with this drug among immunocompromised
patients.

        Question: Does AMBISOME increase or decrease the risk of hip fracture?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I attempted to use the recipient_message tool to ask FDAHandler about the effects of AMBISOME on the risk of hip fracture.
2. However, there seems to be a technical issue or misunderstanding, as I did not receive any information from FDAHandler.
3. Without specific data from the FDA, I cannot provide a reliable answer regarding the effects of AMBISOME on hip fracture risk.

The question was whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. I attempted to consult FDAHandler for information on AMBISOME's effects on hip fracture risk, but due to a technical 
issue or misunderstanding, I did not receive any data from FDAHandler. Without specific FDA data, I cannot provide a reliable answer regarding the effects of AMBISOME on the risk of hip fracture. 
Therefore, my final answer is that I do not know if AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture.
