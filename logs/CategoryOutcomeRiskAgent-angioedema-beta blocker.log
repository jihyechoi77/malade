                Passages:
                1. Drug METOPROLOL TARTRATE: The risk of angioedema is not mentioned in the METOPROLOL TARTRATE label, indicating that there is no known increase or decrease in risk associated with 
METOPROLOL TARTRATE according to the FDA label information.
2. Drug LABETALOL: Labetalol can increase the risk of angioedema, but this is considered a rare adverse reaction.
3. Drug ATENOLOL: The final answer to the question "Does ATENOLOL increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?" is that according to the FDA label data provided by FDAHandler, ATENOLOL does not 
increase the risk of angioedema. Angioedema is not listed as a side effect in the adverse reactions section of the ATENOLOL label. However, it is important to note that other medications in the same 
class as atenolol, such as ACE inhibitors, have been associated with angioedema. Additionally, patients taking beta blockers with a history of anaphylactic reactions may have a more severe reaction 
and may be unresponsive to usual treatments for allergic reactions.

                angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. According to the provided passages:
2. - METOPROLOL TARTRATE does not have a known increase or decrease in the risk of angioedema as per its FDA label.
3. - LABETALOL can increase the risk of angioedema, but this is considered a rare adverse reaction.
4. - ATENOLOL does not increase the risk of angioedema according to its FDA label, and angioedema is not listed as a side effect.
5. Given that two of the drugs (METOPROLOL TARTRATE and ATENOLOL) show no clear effect on the risk of angioedema and one drug (LABETALOL) shows a rare increase in risk, the overall effect of the beta 
blocker category on the risk of angioedema is not consistent across all drugs.
6. The evidence suggests that while there may be a rare increase in risk with some beta blockers like LABETALOL, this is not a common effect for the category as a whole.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the beta blocker category of drugs on the risk of angioedema.
