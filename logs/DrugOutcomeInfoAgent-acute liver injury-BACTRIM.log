CONTENT: BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of BACTRIM or sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim were identified in clinical trials, 
postmarketing or published reports. Because some of these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or 
establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and 
urticaria). BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Fatalities and serious adverse reactions, including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, 
drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; 
agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim
products, including BACTRIM(see WARNINGS ). BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Hematologic: Agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic 
anemia, hypoprothrombinemia, methemoglobinemia, eosinophilia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Allergic Reactions: Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, anaphylaxis, allergic myocarditis, erythema multiforme, exfoliative dermatitis, angioedema, drug fever, chills, Henoch-Schoenlein purpura, serum sickness-like 
syndrome, generalized allergic reactions, generalized skin eruptions, photosensitivity, conjunctival and scleral injection, pruritus, urticaria, rash, periarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP), and acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND) (see WARNINGS ). 
BACTRIM: adverse_reactions: Gastrointestinal: Hepatitis (including cholestatic jaundice and hepatic necrosis), elevation of serum transaminase and bilirubin, pseudomembranous enterocolitis, 
pancreatitis, stomatitis, glossitis, nausea, emesis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia. Genitourinary: Renal failure, interstitial nephritis, BUN and serum creatinine elevation, renal insufficiency, 
oliguria and anuria, crystalluria and nephrotoxicity in association with cyclosporine. Metabolic and Nutritional: Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia (see PRECAUTIONS: Electrolyte Abnormalities ), metabolic 
acidosis. Neurologic: Aseptic meningitis, convulsions, peripheral neuritis, ataxia, vertigo, tinnitus, headache. Psychiatric: Hallucinations, depression, apathy, nervousness. BACTRIM: 
adverse_reactions: Endocrine: The sulfonamides bear certain chemical similarities to some goitrogens, diuretics (acetazolamide and the thiazides) and oral hypoglycemic agents. Cross-sensitivity may 
exist with these agents. Diuresis and hypoglycemia have occurred. Musculoskeletal: Arthralgia, myalgia, rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory: Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates, acute 
eosinophilic pneumonia, acute and delayed lung injury, interstitial lung disease, acute respiratory failure (see WARNINGS ). Cardiovascular System: QT prolongation resulting in ventricular tachycardia
and torsades de pointes , circulatory shock (see WARNINGS ) . Miscellaneous: Weakness, fatigue, insomnia.

CONTENT: BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger 
subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate 
deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or 
without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased 
incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be 
monitored. BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage 
adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
section). The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given 
concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM 
treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Bactrim Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Bactrim DS Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.
BACTRIM: geriatric_use: Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher 
and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics ).

CONTENT: BACTRIM: teratogenic_effects: Teratogenic Effects Human Data While there are no large prospective, well controlled studies in pregnant women and their babies, some retrospective epidemiologic
studies suggest an association between first trimester exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly neural tube defects, 
cardiovascular abnormalities, urinary tract defects, oral clefts, and club foot. These studies, however, were limited by the small number of exposed cases and the lack of adjustment for multiple 
statistical comparisons and confounders. These studies are further limited by recall, selection, and information biases, and by limited generalizability of their findings. Lastly, outcome measures 
varied between studies, limiting cross-study comparisons. Alternatively, other epidemiologic studies did not detect statistically significant associations between sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim 
exposure and specific malformations. BACTRIM: precautions: Animal Data In rats, oral doses of either 533 mg/kg sulfamethoxazole or 200 mg/kg trimethoprim produced teratologic effects manifested mainly
as cleft palates. These doses are approximately 5 and 6 times the recommended human total daily dose on a body surface area basis. In two studies in rats, no teratology was observed when 512 mg/kg of 
sulfamethoxazole was used in combination with 128 mg/kg of trimethoprim. In some rabbit studies, an overall increase in fetal loss (dead and resorbed conceptuses) was associated with doses of 
trimethoprim 6 times the human therapeutic dose based on body surface area. Nonteratogenic Effects See CONTRAINDICATIONS section. Nursing Mothers Levels of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in breast 
milk are approximately 2–5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. BACTRIM: precautions: Caution should be exercised when BACTRIM is administered to a nursing woman, 
especially when breastfeeding jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus. Pediatric Use BACTRIM is contraindicated for 
infants younger than 2 months of age (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and 
over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions 
exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. BACTRIM: precautions: Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see

CONTENT: BACTRIM: warnings: WARNINGS Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions Fatalities and serious adverse reactions including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous 
pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the 
administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Cough, shortness of breath and pulmonary infiltrates potentially representing hypersensitivity
reactions of the respiratory tract have been reported in association with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment. BACTRIM: warnings: Other severe pulmonary adverse reactions occurring within days
to week of BACTRIM initiation and resulting in prolonged respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), lung transplantation or death have also 
been reported in patients and otherwise healthy individuals treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products. Circulatory shock with fever, severe hypotension, and confusion requiring 
intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors has occurred within minutes to hours of re-challenge with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including BACTRIM, in patients with history of 
recent (days to weeks) exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. BACTRIM should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of a serious adverse reaction. BACTRIM: warnings: 
A skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, AFND, AGEP, hepatic necrosis, or serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS 
and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Clinical signs, such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions. 
Thrombocytopenia BACTRIM-induced thrombocytopenia may be an immune-mediated disorder. Severe cases of thrombocytopenia that are fatal or life threatening have been reported. Thrombocytopenia usually 
resolves within a week upon discontinuation of BACTRIM. BACTRIM: warnings: Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever The sulfonamides should not be used for treatment of group A β-hemolytic 
streptococcal infections. In an established infection, they will not eradicate the streptococcus and, therefore, will not prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever. Clostridioides difficile Associated 
Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including BACTRIM, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal 
colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of 
CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. BACTRIM: warnings:
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the 
administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte 
management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Risk Associated with Concurrent Use of Leucovorin for 
Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia Treatment failure and excess mortality were observed when BACTRIM was used concomitantly with leucovorin for the treatment of HIV positive patients with P. jirovecii 
pneumonia in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. 4 Avoid coadministration of BACTRIM and leucovorin during treatment of P . jirovecii pneumonia.
