                1. Drug WARFARIN: WARFARIN decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. This conclusion is based on the Warfarin Re-Infarction Study (WARIS), which showed that 
treatment with warfarin led to a 24% risk reduction in total mortality compared to placebo. The FDA label for WARFARIN confirms its indication for reducing the risk of death after myocardial 
infarction.

                Does the warfarin category of drugs increase the risk of
                mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the warfarin category of drugs increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passage provides information from the Warfarin Re-Infarction Study (WARIS) indicating that treatment with warfarin led to a 24% risk reduction in total mortality compared to placebo.
2. The FDA label for WARFARIN also confirms its indication for reducing the risk of death after myocardial infarction.
3. Based on the evidence from a clinical study (WARIS) and the FDA label, it can be concluded that warfarin decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
        -----
        Final answer: The warfarin category of drugs decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction.
