[1;34m2[0m[34m. Drug PHENYTOIN: The question was whether PHENYTOIN increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. I consulted FDAHandler, and the response indicated that PHENYTOIN has been associated with [0m

[34mAplastic anemia is a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce sufficient new cells to replenish blood cells, and pancytopenia can be a manifestation of aplastic anemia. Therefore, the [0m
[34minformation suggests that PHENYTOIN increases the risk of aplastic anemia.[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. Drug EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: The question was whether EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. According to the information provided by FDAHandler, EXTENDED [0m

[34mcells, such as thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia, with or without bone marrow suppression. Additionally, pure red cell aplasia, which is related to [0m
[34maplastic anemia, has been reported. However, the frequency of these events and the clarity of the causal relationship to the drug are not well established.[0m

[34mTherefore, while there is an association between EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM and hematopoietic complications, including conditions related to aplastic anemia, the degree of risk and the reliability of [0m
