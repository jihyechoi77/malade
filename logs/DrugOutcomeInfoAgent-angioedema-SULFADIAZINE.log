CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Several cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in patients receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy. 1,2,3 Leukopenia associated with
silver sulfadiazine administration is primarily characterized by decreased neutrophil count. Maximal white blood cell depression occurs within two to four days of initiation of therapy. Rebound to 
normal leukocyte levels follows onset within two to three days. Recovery is not influenced by continuation of silver sulfadiazine therapy. An increased incidence has been seen in patients treated 
concurrently with cimetidine. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiforme, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial nephritis. Reduction in 
bacterial growth after application of topical antibacterial agents has been reported to permit spontaneous healing of deep partial-thickness burns by preventing conversion of the partial thickness to 
full thickness by sepsis. SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: However, reduction in bacterial colonization has caused delayed separation, in some cases necessitating escharotomy in order to prevent 
contracture.         
SOURCE:SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category B. A reproductive study has been performed in rabbits at doses up to three to ten times the concentration of silver
sulfadiazine in silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% and has revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to silver sulfadiazine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant 
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly justified, especially in pregnant women approaching or
at term. SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: (See CONTRAINDICATIONS )         
SOURCE:SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is a topical antimicrobial drug indicated as an adjunct for the prevention and treatment of wound 
sepsis in patients with second and third degree burns.         
SOURCE:SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to silver sulfadiazine or any of the other 
ingredients in the preparation. Because sulfonamide therapy is known to increase the possibility of kernicterus, silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should not be used on pregnant women approaching or 
at term, on premature infants, or on newborn infants during the first 2 months of life.         
SOURCE:SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prompt institution of appropriate regimens for care of the burned patient is of prime importance and includes the control of
shock and pain. The burn wounds are then cleansed and debrided; silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is then applied under sterile conditions. The burn areas should be covered with silver sulfadiazine 
cream, USP 1% at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of approximately one sixteenth of an inch. Whenever necessary, the cream should be reapplied to any areas 
from which it has been removed by patient activity. Administration may be accomplished in minimal time because dressings are not required. However, if individual patient requirements make dressings 
necessary, they may be used. Reapply immediately after hydrotherapy. Treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should be continued until satisfactory healing has occurred or until the burn site
is ready for grafting. SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: The drug should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except if a significant 
adverse reaction occurs.         
SOURCE:SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: warnings: WARNINGS Absorption of silver sulfadiazine varies depending upon the percent of body surface area and the extent of the tissue damage. Although few have been reported,
it is possible that any adverse reaction associated with sulfonamides may occur. Some of the reactions which have been associated with sulfonamides are as follows: blood dyscrasias including 
agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hemolytic anemia; dermatologic and allergic reactions, including life-threatening cutaneous reactions [Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and exfoliative dermatitis]; gastrointestinal reactions, hepatitis and hepatocellular necrosis; CNS reactions; and toxic nephrosis. There is a potential 
cross-sensitivity between silver sulfadiazine and other sulfonamides. SULFADIAZINE: warnings: If allergic reactions attributable to treatment with silver sulfadiazine occur, continuation of therapy 
must be weighed against the potential hazards of the particular allergic reaction. Fungal proliferation in and below the eschar may occur. However, the incidence of clinically reported fungal 
superinfection is low. The use of silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% in some cases of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient individuals may be hazardous, as hemolysis may occur.

ANSWER: The available information from the SULFADIAZINE label does not specifically mention an increased risk of angioedema. However, it does list several dermatologic and allergic reactions, 
including life-threatening cutaneous reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and exfoliative dermatitis, which are associated with sulfonamides. It is 
possible that angioedema could be included in the spectrum of allergic reactions, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided extracts.

        Question: Does SULFADIAZINE increase or decrease the risk of angioedema?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if SULFADIAZINE increases the risk of angioedema.
2. FDAHandler responded that the SULFADIAZINE label does not specifically mention an increased risk of angioedema, but it does list several dermatologic and allergic reactions, including 
life-threatening cutaneous reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and exfoliative dermatitis, which are associated with sulfonamides.
3. Angioedema could potentially be included in the spectrum of allergic reactions to sulfonamides, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the label extracts provided by FDAHandler.
        -----
        Final answer: The risk of angioedema associated with SULFADIAZINE is not explicitly mentioned in the FDA label data. However, given that sulfonamides are associated with a range of 
dermatologic and allergic reactions, it is possible that angioedema could be a part of these reactions, although this is not confirmed by the label information.

The question was whether SULFADIAZINE increases or decreases the risk of angioedema. According to the response from FDAHandler, the SULFADIAZINE label does not specifically mention an increased risk 
of angioedema. However, the label does list several dermatologic and allergic reactions, including life-threatening cutaneous reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal 
necrolysis (TEN), and exfoliative dermatitis, which are associated with sulfonamides. While angioedema could potentially be included in the spectrum of allergic reactions to sulfonamides, it is not 
explicitly mentioned in the label extracts provided. Therefore, the degree of risk of angioedema associated with SULFADIAZINE cannot be confirmed by the FDA label data.
