[31manticholinergic side effects and should be used with caution in individuals whose conditions may be aggravated by anticholinergic activity. Pimozide should be administered cautiously to patients with [0m
[31mimpairment of liver or kidney function, because it is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Antipsychotics should be administered with caution to patients receiving anticonvulsant [0m

[31mpatient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary [0m
[31msource of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only [0m

[31mlikelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if [0m
[31mpossible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to [0m
[31munderstand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under [0m[1;31m12[0m[31m years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP [0m
[31mfrom foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed[0m
[31mthat all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected [0m
[31mdeaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the [0m
[31mheart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.[0m
[31mAlso, pimozide, at a dose about [0m[1;31m15[0m[31m times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. [0m
[31mSimilar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the [0m
[31mdrug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.         [0m

[31mimpairment of liver or kidney function, because it is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Antipsychotics should be administered with caution to patients receiving anticonvulsant [0m

[31mpatient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary [0m
[31msource of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only [0m

[31mlikelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if [0m
[31mpossible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to [0m
[31munderstand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under [0m[1;31m12[0m[31m years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP [0m
[31mfrom foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed[0m
[31mthat all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected [0m
[31mdeaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the [0m
[31mheart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.[0m
[31mAlso, pimozide, at a dose about [0m[1;31m15[0m[31m times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. [0m
[31mSimilar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the [0m
[31mdrug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.         [0m

[31mhyperplasia at doses approximating the human dose and adenoma at doses about fifteen times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg per kg basis. The mechanism for the induction of pituitary tumors [0m
[31min mice is not known. Mammary gland tumors in female mice were also increased, but these tumors are expected in rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs which elevate prolactin levels. Chronic [0m
[31madministration of an antipsychotic also causes elevated prolactin levels in humans. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in [0m
[31mvitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Although disturbances such as [0m
[31mgalactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither [0m
[31mclinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis. The available evidence, however, is [0m
