CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect: In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and 
agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug
induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently 
during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of pimozide should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. 
Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. PIMOZIDE: 
precautions: Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue pimozide and have their WBC followed until recovery. GENERAL Pimozide may impair the mental 
and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during the first few days of therapy. Pimozide produces 
anticholinergic side effects and should be used with caution in individuals whose conditions may be aggravated by anticholinergic activity. Pimozide should be administered cautiously to patients with 
impairment of liver or kidney function, because it is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Antipsychotics should be administered with caution to patients receiving anticonvulsant 
medication, with a history of seizures, or with EEG abnormalities, because they may lower the convulsive threshold. If indicated, adequate anticonvulsant therapy should be maintained concomitantly. 
PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Treatment with pimozide tablets, USP exposes the patient to serious risks. A decision to use pimozide tablets, USP chronically in 
Tourette’s Disorder is one that deserves full consideration by the patient (or patient’s family) as well as by the treating physician. Because the goal of treatment is symptomatic improvement, the 
patient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary 
source of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only 
for use in patients with Tourette’s Disorder whose symptoms are severe and who cannot tolerate, or who do not respond to HALDOL ® (haloperidol). PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Given the 
likelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if 
possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to 
understand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under 12 years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP 
from foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed
that all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected 
deaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the 
heart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.
Also, pimozide, at a dose about 15 times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. 
Similar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the 
drug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride may be required for control of such reactions. It should be 
noted that persistent extrapyramidal reactions have been reported and that the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases. Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs: Generally, patients receiving 
short term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt 
withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under “Tardive Dyskinesia” except for duration. It is not known whether gradual 
withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs, but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw 
use of pimozide. PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Tardive Dyskinesia: Pimozide may be associated with persistent dyskinesias. Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, 
involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may occur after drug therapy has been discontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on 
high-dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue, face, mouth or
jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities and the trunk. There is no known 
effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; antiparkinson agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms
appear. PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked. It
has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop. 
Electrocardiographic Changes: Electrocardiographic changes have been observed in clinical trials of pimozide in Tourette’s Disorder and schizophrenia. These have included prolongation of the QT 
interval, flattening, notching and inversion of the T wave and the appearance of U waves. Sudden, unexpected deaths and grand mal seizure have occurred at doses above 20 mg/day. Neuroleptic Malignant 
Syndrome: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported with pimozide. (See WARNINGS for further information concerning NMS. PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Hyperpyrexia: Hyperpyrexia has been 
reported with other antipsychotic drugs. Clinical Trials The following adverse reaction tabulation was derived from 20 patients in a 6-week long placebo-controlled clinical trial of pimozide in

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: DRUG INTERACTIONS Because pimozide prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, an additive effect on QT interval would be anticipated if administered with 
other drugs, such as phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants or antiarrhythmic agents, which prolong the QT interval. Accordingly, pimozide should not be given with dofetilide, sotalol, quinidine, 
other Class Ia and III anti-arrhythmics, mesoridazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, droperidol, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, halofantrine, mefloquine, pentamidine, arsenic trioxide, 
levomethadyl acetate, dolasetron mesylate, probucol, tacrolimus, ziprasidone, or other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects. PIMOZIDE: 
drug_interactions: Also, the use of macrolide antibiotics in patients with prolonged QT intervals has been rarely associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Such concomitant administration should not be
undertaken (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Since pimozide is partly metabolized via CYP 3A4, it should not be administered concomitantly with inhibitors of this metabolic system, such as azole antifungal 
agents and protease inhibitor drugs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Pimozide and Celexa: In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg coadministered with racemic citalopram 40 mg given once daily 
for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Racemic citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The 
mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known. PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: Concomitant use of Pimozide and Celexa or Lexapro is contraindicated (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). CYP 2D6 
inhibitors: In healthy subjects, co-administration of pimozide 2 mg (single dose) and paroxetine 60 mg resulted in a 151% increase in pimozide AUC and a 62% increase in pimozide C max compared to 
pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and C max is related to the CYP 2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine. Concomitant use of pimozide and paroxetine or other strong CYP 2D6 
inhibitors are contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: As CYP 1A2 may also contribute to the metabolism of pimozide, prescribers should be aware of the theoretical 
potential for drug interactions with inhibitors of this enzymatic system. Pimozide may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants, including analgesics, sedatives, anxiolytics, and alcohol. Rare case 
reports have suggested possible additive effects of pimozide and fluoxetine leading to bradycardia. Concomitant administration of pimozide and sertraline should be contraindicated (See 
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pharmacogenomics Individuals with genetic variations resulting in poor CYP 2D6 metabolism (approximately 5 to 10% of the population) exhibit higher pimozide concentrations than 
extensive CYP 2D6 metabolizers. PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: The concentrations observed in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers are similar to those seen with strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine. The 
time to achieve steady state Pimozide concentrations is expected to be longer (approximately 2 weeks) in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers because of the prolonged half-life. Alternative dosing strategies are
recommended in patients who are genetically poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ). Interaction with Food Patients should avoid grapefruit juice because it may inhibit the 
metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4. PIMOZIDE: precautions: The concentrations observed in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers are similar to those seen with strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine. The time
to achieve steady state Pimozide concentrations is expected to be longer (approximately 2 weeks) in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers because of the prolonged half-life. Alternative dosing strategies are 
recommended in patients who are genetically poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ). Interaction with Food Patients should avoid grapefruit juice because it may inhibit the 
metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4. CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, pimozide causes a dose-related increase in 
pituitary and mammary tumors. PIMOZIDE: precautions: When mice were treated for up to 18 months with pimozide, pituitary gland changes developed in females only. These changes were characterized as 
hyperplasia at doses approximating the human dose and adenoma at doses about fifteen times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg per kg basis. The mechanism for the induction of pituitary tumors 
in mice is not known. Mammary gland tumors in female mice were also increased, but these tumors are expected in rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs which elevate prolactin levels. Chronic 
administration of an antipsychotic also causes elevated prolactin levels in humans. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in 
vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Although disturbances such as 
galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither 
clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis. The available evidence, however, is 
considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, animals received up to 50 times the maximum recommended human dose. No increased incidence of overall
tumors or tumors at any site was observed in either sex. Because of the limited number of animals surviving this study, the meaning of these results is unclear. Pimozide did not have mutagenic 
activity in the Ames test with four bacterial test strains, in the mouse dominant lethal test or in the micronucleus test in rats. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Reproduction studies in animals were not 
adequate to assess all aspects of fertility. Nevertheless, female rats administered pimozide had prolonged estrus cycles, an effect also produced by other antipsychotic drugs. PREGNANCY Teratogenic 
Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 8 times the maximum human dose did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity. In the rat, however, 
this multiple of the human dose resulted in decreased pregnancies and in the retarded development of fetuses. These effects are thought to be due to an inhibition or delay in implantation which is 
also observed in rodents administered other antipsychotic drugs. In the rabbit, maternal toxicity, mortality, decreased weight gain, and embryotoxicity including increased resorptions were 
dose-related. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, pimozide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefits of 
treatment clearly outweigh the potential risks. Nonteratogenic effects. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or 
withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These 
complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Pimozide 
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. LABOR & DELIVERY This drug has no recognized use in labor or delivery.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect: In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and 
agranulocytosis have been reported temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug
induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently 
during the first few months of therapy and discontinuation of pimozide should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. 
Patients with clinically significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. PIMOZIDE: 
precautions: Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue pimozide and have their WBC followed until recovery. GENERAL Pimozide may impair the mental 
and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during the first few days of therapy. Pimozide produces 
anticholinergic side effects and should be used with caution in individuals whose conditions may be aggravated by anticholinergic activity. Pimozide should be administered cautiously to patients with 
impairment of liver or kidney function, because it is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Antipsychotics should be administered with caution to patients receiving anticonvulsant 
medication, with a history of seizures, or with EEG abnormalities, because they may lower the convulsive threshold. If indicated, adequate anticonvulsant therapy should be maintained concomitantly. 
PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Treatment with pimozide tablets, USP exposes the patient to serious risks. A decision to use pimozide tablets, USP chronically in 
Tourette’s Disorder is one that deserves full consideration by the patient (or patient’s family) as well as by the treating physician. Because the goal of treatment is symptomatic improvement, the 
patient’s view of the need for treatment and assessment of response are critical in evaluating the impact of therapy and weighing its benefits against the risks. Since the physician is the primary 
source of information about the use of a drug in any disease, it is recommended that the following information be discussed with patients and/or their families. Pimozide tablets, USP is intended only 
for use in patients with Tourette’s Disorder whose symptoms are severe and who cannot tolerate, or who do not respond to HALDOL ® (haloperidol). PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Given the 
likelihood that a proportion of patients exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if 
possible, full information about this risk. The decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to 
understand the information provided. There is limited information available on the use of pimozide tablets, USP in children under 12 years of age. The information available on pimozide tablets, USP 
from foreign marketing experience and from U.S. clinical trials indicates that pimozide tablets, USP has a side effect profile similar to that of other antipsychotic drugs. Patients should be informed
that all types of side effects associated with the use of antipsychotics may be associated with the use of pimozide tablets, USP. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: In addition, sudden, unexpected 
deaths have occurred in patients taking high doses of pimozide tablets, USP for conditions other than Tourette’s Disorder. These deaths may have been the result of an effect of pimozide upon the 
heart. Therefore, patients should be instructed not to exceed the prescribed dose of pimozide tablets, USP and they should realize the need for the initial ECG and for follow-up ECGs during treatment.
Also, pimozide, at a dose about 15 times that given humans, caused an increase in the number of benign tumors of the pituitary gland in female mice. It is not possible to say how important this is. 
Similar tumors were not seen in rats given pimozide, nor at lower doses in mice, which is reassuring. However, any such finding must be considered to suggest a possible risk of long term use of the 
drug. PIMOZIDE: information_for_patients: Because substances in grapefruit juice may inhibit the metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4, patients should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice.

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Administration of antiparkinson drugs such as benztropine mesylate or trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride may be required for control of such reactions. It should be 
noted that persistent extrapyramidal reactions have been reported and that the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases. Withdrawal Emergent Neurological Signs: Generally, patients receiving 
short term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after abrupt 
withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under “Tardive Dyskinesia” except for duration. It is not known whether gradual 
withdrawal of antipsychotic drugs will reduce the rate of occurrence of withdrawal emergent neurological signs, but until further evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw 
use of pimozide. PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Tardive Dyskinesia: Pimozide may be associated with persistent dyskinesias. Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, 
involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may occur after drug therapy has been discontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on 
high-dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear irreversible. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue, face, mouth or
jaw (e.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements). Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities and the trunk. There is no known 
effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; antiparkinson agents usually do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. It is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be discontinued if these symptoms
appear. PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Should it be necessary to reinstitute treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked. It
has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and if the medication is stopped at that time the syndrome may not develop. 
Electrocardiographic Changes: Electrocardiographic changes have been observed in clinical trials of pimozide in Tourette’s Disorder and schizophrenia. These have included prolongation of the QT 
interval, flattening, notching and inversion of the T wave and the appearance of U waves. Sudden, unexpected deaths and grand mal seizure have occurred at doses above 20 mg/day. Neuroleptic Malignant 
Syndrome: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has been reported with pimozide. (See WARNINGS for further information concerning NMS. PIMOZIDE: adverse_reactions: Hyperpyrexia: Hyperpyrexia has been 
reported with other antipsychotic drugs. Clinical Trials The following adverse reaction tabulation was derived from 20 patients in a 6-week long placebo-controlled clinical trial of pimozide in

CONTENT: PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: DRUG INTERACTIONS Because pimozide prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, an additive effect on QT interval would be anticipated if administered with 
other drugs, such as phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants or antiarrhythmic agents, which prolong the QT interval. Accordingly, pimozide should not be given with dofetilide, sotalol, quinidine, 
other Class Ia and III anti-arrhythmics, mesoridazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, droperidol, sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, halofantrine, mefloquine, pentamidine, arsenic trioxide, 
levomethadyl acetate, dolasetron mesylate, probucol, tacrolimus, ziprasidone, or other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects. PIMOZIDE: 
drug_interactions: Also, the use of macrolide antibiotics in patients with prolonged QT intervals has been rarely associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Such concomitant administration should not be
undertaken (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Since pimozide is partly metabolized via CYP 3A4, it should not be administered concomitantly with inhibitors of this metabolic system, such as azole antifungal 
agents and protease inhibitor drugs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Pimozide and Celexa: In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg coadministered with racemic citalopram 40 mg given once daily 
for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Racemic citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The 
mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known. PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: Concomitant use of Pimozide and Celexa or Lexapro is contraindicated (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). CYP 2D6 
inhibitors: In healthy subjects, co-administration of pimozide 2 mg (single dose) and paroxetine 60 mg resulted in a 151% increase in pimozide AUC and a 62% increase in pimozide C max compared to 
pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and C max is related to the CYP 2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine. Concomitant use of pimozide and paroxetine or other strong CYP 2D6 
inhibitors are contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: As CYP 1A2 may also contribute to the metabolism of pimozide, prescribers should be aware of the theoretical 
potential for drug interactions with inhibitors of this enzymatic system. Pimozide may be capable of potentiating CNS depressants, including analgesics, sedatives, anxiolytics, and alcohol. Rare case 
reports have suggested possible additive effects of pimozide and fluoxetine leading to bradycardia. Concomitant administration of pimozide and sertraline should be contraindicated (See 
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Pharmacogenomics Individuals with genetic variations resulting in poor CYP 2D6 metabolism (approximately 5 to 10% of the population) exhibit higher pimozide concentrations than 
extensive CYP 2D6 metabolizers. PIMOZIDE: drug_interactions: The concentrations observed in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers are similar to those seen with strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine. The 
time to achieve steady state Pimozide concentrations is expected to be longer (approximately 2 weeks) in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers because of the prolonged half-life. Alternative dosing strategies are
recommended in patients who are genetically poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ). Interaction with Food Patients should avoid grapefruit juice because it may inhibit the 
metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4. PIMOZIDE: precautions: The concentrations observed in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers are similar to those seen with strong CYP 2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine. The time
to achieve steady state Pimozide concentrations is expected to be longer (approximately 2 weeks) in poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers because of the prolonged half-life. Alternative dosing strategies are 
recommended in patients who are genetically poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ). Interaction with Food Patients should avoid grapefruit juice because it may inhibit the 
metabolism of pimozide by CYP 3A4. CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats. In mice, pimozide causes a dose-related increase in 
pituitary and mammary tumors. PIMOZIDE: precautions: When mice were treated for up to 18 months with pimozide, pituitary gland changes developed in females only. These changes were characterized as 
hyperplasia at doses approximating the human dose and adenoma at doses about fifteen times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg per kg basis. The mechanism for the induction of pituitary tumors 
in mice is not known. Mammary gland tumors in female mice were also increased, but these tumors are expected in rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs which elevate prolactin levels. Chronic 
administration of an antipsychotic also causes elevated prolactin levels in humans. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin-dependent in 
vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously detected breast cancer. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Although disturbances such as 
galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither 
clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis. The available evidence, however, is 
considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. In a 24-month carcinogenicity study in rats, animals received up to 50 times the maximum recommended human dose. No increased incidence of overall
tumors or tumors at any site was observed in either sex. Because of the limited number of animals surviving this study, the meaning of these results is unclear. Pimozide did not have mutagenic 
activity in the Ames test with four bacterial test strains, in the mouse dominant lethal test or in the micronucleus test in rats. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Reproduction studies in animals were not 
adequate to assess all aspects of fertility. Nevertheless, female rats administered pimozide had prolonged estrus cycles, an effect also produced by other antipsychotic drugs. PREGNANCY Teratogenic 
Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to 8 times the maximum human dose did not reveal evidence of teratogenicity. In the rat, however, 
this multiple of the human dose resulted in decreased pregnancies and in the retarded development of fetuses. These effects are thought to be due to an inhibition or delay in implantation which is 
also observed in rodents administered other antipsychotic drugs. In the rabbit, maternal toxicity, mortality, decreased weight gain, and embryotoxicity including increased resorptions were 
dose-related. PIMOZIDE: precautions: Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, pimozide should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefits of 
treatment clearly outweigh the potential risks. Nonteratogenic effects. Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or 
withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These 
complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Pimozide 
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. LABOR & DELIVERY This drug has no recognized use in labor or delivery.

The FDA label for PIMOZIDE does not specifically associate the use of the drug with an increased or decreased risk of aplastic anemia. However, the label does mention that leukopenia/neutropenia and 
agranulocytosis have been reported in temporal relation to antipsychotic agents, including pimozide. Patients with a history of low white blood cell count or drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should
be monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy, and consideration should be given to discontinuing pimozide if there is a clinically significant decline in white blood cells in the 
absence of other causative factors. This information suggests that while there is no direct mention of aplastic anemia, there is a concern for other blood-related issues that could potentially be 
related to bone marrow suppression, which is a feature of aplastic anemia.
