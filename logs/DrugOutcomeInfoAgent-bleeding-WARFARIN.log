[32mWARFARIN increases the risk of bleeding, which can be serious and sometimes lead to death. This is based on the medication guide for WARFARIN, which states that it can cause bleeding. There are [0m
[32mspecific warnings about the bleeding risk, including a boxed warning indicating that WARFARIN sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Regular monitoring of INR is required to minimize the risk of [0m
[32mbleeding, and certain populations are at higher risk.[0m
