[32mThe FDA label for ALENDRONATE does not directly address whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. The label does mention that in preclinical studies with rats, there was an [0m

[32mrenal failure. However, this information does not provide direct evidence regarding the risk of renal failure in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, we cannot determine from the FDA label [0m
