        -----
        
CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Distribution Preclinical studies (in male rats) show that alendronate sodium transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/kg IV administration 
but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine. The mean steady-state volume of distribution, exclusive of bone, is at least 28 L in humans. Concentrations of drug in plasma 
following therapeutic oral doses are too low (less than 5 ng/mL) for analytical detection. Protein binding in human plasma is approximately 78%. Metabolism There is no evidence that alendronate sodium
is metabolized in animals or humans. Excretion Following a single IV dose of [ 14 C]alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no 
radioactivity was recovered in the feces. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Following a single 10 mg IV dose, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 mL/min (64, 78; 90% confidence interval [CI]),
and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 mL/min. Plasma concentrations fell by more than 95% within 6 hours following IV administration. The terminal half-life in humans is estimated to exceed 10 
years, probably reflecting release of alendronate from the skeleton. Based on the above, it is estimated that after 10 years of oral treatment with alendronate sodium (10 mg daily) the amount of 
alendronate released daily from the skeleton is approximately 25% of that absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Specific Populations Gender: Bioavailability and the fraction of an intravenous dose
excreted in urine were similar in men and women. Geriatric: Bioavailability and disposition (urinary excretion) were similar in elderly and younger patients. No dosage adjustment is necessary in 
elderly patients . ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Race: Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Renal Impairment: Preclinical studies show that, in rats with kidney 
failure, increasing amounts of drug are present in plasma, kidney, spleen, and tibia. In healthy controls, drug that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the urine. No evidence of 
saturation of bone uptake was found after 3 weeks dosing with cumulative intravenous doses of 35 mg/kg in young male rats. Although no formal renal impairment pharmacokinetic study has been conducted 
in patients, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of 
alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min. ALENDRONATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: BINOSTO is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with alendronate in renal failure. Hepatic Impairment: As there 
is evidence that alendronate is not metabolized or excreted in the bile, no studies were conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. No dosage adjustment is necessary. Drug Interactions Ranitidine:
Intravenous ranitidine was shown to double the bioavailability of oral alendronate. The clinical significance of this increased bioavailability and whether similar increases will occur in patients 
given oral H 2 -antagonists is unknown. Prednisone: In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) did not produce a clinically meaningful change in the oral 
bioavailability of alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20 to 44%). ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Calcium and Multivalent Cations: Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations 
are likely to interfere with absorption of alendronate. Levothyroxine: The geometric mean AUC(0-âˆž) and C max of alendronate decreased by 7% (point estimate: 0.93; 90% CI: 0.79-1.08) and 9% (point 
estimate: 0.91; 90% CI: 0.77-1.08), respectively, when a single dose of BINOSTO (70 mg alendronate) and 600 mcg levothyroxine were given concomitantly to 29 healthy male and female subjects.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts
on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, 
bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and
specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately 
reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass 
that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or 
kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of 
bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the 
spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90, the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. ALENDRONATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes.
Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women 
produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as 
deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy 
with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) 
reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to 
those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone 
resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. 
ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by 
approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased 
osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year 
studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of 
bone turnover reached a new steady state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: As a result of inhibition of 
bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from 
baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate sodium 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium 
were observed for the five-year duration of treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate 
sodium 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the 
positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption. ALENDRONATE: clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Men Treatment of men with osteoporosis 
with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day for two years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately
40%. Similar reductions were observed in a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Relative to an intravenous (IV) 
reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardized 
breakfast. Oral bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet in men (0.59%) was similar to that in women when administered after an overnight fast and 2 hours before breakfast. ALENDRONATE: 
clinical_pharmacology: BINOSTO 70 mg effervescent tablet and alendronate sodium 70 mg tablet are bioequivalent. A study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of BINOSTO was performed in
119 healthy women. Bioavailability was decreased (by approximately 50%) when 70 mg alendronate sodium was administered 15 minutes before a standardized breakfast, when compared to dosing 4 hours 
before eating. In studies of treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast. Bioavailability was negligible whether 
alendronate sodium was administered with or up to 2 hours after a standardized breakfast. Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately
60%.

preclinical studies with rats, increasing amounts of drug were present in plasma, kidney, spleen, and tibia in rats with kidney failure, indicating that elimination of alendronate via the kidney will 
be reduced in patients with impaired renal function. Consequently, there might be greater accumulation of alendronate in bone in patients with impaired renal function. No dosage adjustment is 
necessary for patients with creatinine clearance 35 to 60 mL/min, but ALENDRONATE is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with 
alendronate in renal failure. This suggests caution when using alendronate in patients with existing renal impairment, but does not provide information on the risk of renal failure in patients with 
normal renal function.

The FDA label for ALENDRONATE does not directly address whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. The label does mention that in preclinical studies with rats, there was an 
increased accumulation of alendronate in the presence of renal failure, which suggests that elimination of the drug is reduced in patients with impaired renal function. The label advises caution when 
using alendronate in patients with existing renal impairment and does not recommend its use for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min due to lack of experience with alendronate in 
renal failure. However, this information does not provide direct evidence regarding the risk of renal failure in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, we cannot determine from the FDA label 
whether alendronate increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
