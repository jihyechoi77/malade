CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In studies in which mice and rats were administered diazepam in the 
diet at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 and 12 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD = 1 mg/kg/day] on a mg/m 2 basis) for 80 and 104 weeks, respectively, an increased 
incidence of liver tumors was observed in males of both species. The data currently available are inadequate to determine the mutagenic potential of diazepam. Reproduction studies in rats showed 
decreases in the number of pregnancies and in the number of surviving offspring following administration of an oral dose of 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 16 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) prior to 
and during mating and throughout gestation and lactation. DIAZEPAM: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: No adverse effects on fertility or offspring viability were noted at a 
dose of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 13 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: warnings: WARNINGS Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Concomitant use of benzodiazepiones, including diazepam tablets, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory 
depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have 
demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe diazepam 
tablets concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and 
sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of diazepam tablets than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. 
DIAZEPAM: warnings: If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking diazepam tablets, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response. Advise both patients 
and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when diazepam tablets are used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of 
concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction The use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, exposes users to the 
risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. DIAZEPAM: warnings: Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the 
maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, 
including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse ). Before prescribing diazepam tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, 
misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of diazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of 
diazepam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other 
substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects most commonly reported were drowsiness, fatigue, muscle weakness, and ataxia. The following have also been reported: Central 
Nervous System: confusion, depression, dysarthria, headache, slurred speech, tremor, vertigo Gastrointestinal System: constipation, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances Special Senses: blurred 
vision, diplopia, dizziness Cardiovascular System: hypotension Psychiatric and Paradoxical Reactions: stimulation, restlessness, acute hyperexcited states, anxiety, agitation, aggressiveness, 
irritability, rage, hallucinations, psychoses, delusions, increased muscle spasticity, insomnia, sleep disturbances, and nightmares. Inappropriate behavior and other adverse behavioral effects have 
been reported when using benzodiazepines. Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued. They are more likely to occur in children and in the elderly. DIAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: 
Urogenital System: incontinence, changes in libido, urinary retention Skin and Appendages: skin reactions Laboratories: elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase Other: changes in salivation, 
including dry mouth, hypersalivation Antegrade amnesia may occur using therapeutic dosages, the risk increasing at higher dosages. Amnestic effects may be associated with inappropriate behavior. Minor
changes in EEG patterns, usually low-voltage fast activity, have been observed in patients during and after diazepam tablets therapy and are of no known significance. Because of isolated reports of 
neutropenia and jaundice, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy. Postmarketing Experience Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications There have been
reports of falls and fractures in benzodiazepine users. The risk is increased in those taking concomitant sedatives (including alcohol), and in the elderly.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In studies in which mice and rats were administered diazepam in the 
diet at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 and 12 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD = 1 mg/kg/day] on a mg/m 2 basis) for 80 and 104 weeks, respectively, an increased 
incidence of liver tumors was observed in males of both species. The data currently available are inadequate to determine the mutagenic potential of diazepam. Reproduction studies in rats showed 
decreases in the number of pregnancies and in the number of surviving offspring following administration of an oral dose of 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 16 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) prior to 
and during mating and throughout gestation and lactation. DIAZEPAM: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: No adverse effects on fertility or offspring viability were noted at a 
dose of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 13 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis).

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: warnings: WARNINGS Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Concomitant use of benzodiazepiones, including diazepam tablets, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory 
depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have 
demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe diazepam 
tablets concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and 
sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of diazepam tablets than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. 
DIAZEPAM: warnings: If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking diazepam tablets, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response. Advise both patients 
and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when diazepam tablets are used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of 
concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction The use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, exposes users to the 
risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. DIAZEPAM: warnings: Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the 
maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, 
including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse ). Before prescribing diazepam tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, 
misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of diazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of 
diazepam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other 
substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects most commonly reported were drowsiness, fatigue, muscle weakness, and ataxia. The following have also been reported: Central 
Nervous System: confusion, depression, dysarthria, headache, slurred speech, tremor, vertigo Gastrointestinal System: constipation, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances Special Senses: blurred 
vision, diplopia, dizziness Cardiovascular System: hypotension Psychiatric and Paradoxical Reactions: stimulation, restlessness, acute hyperexcited states, anxiety, agitation, aggressiveness, 
irritability, rage, hallucinations, psychoses, delusions, increased muscle spasticity, insomnia, sleep disturbances, and nightmares. Inappropriate behavior and other adverse behavioral effects have 
been reported when using benzodiazepines. Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued. They are more likely to occur in children and in the elderly. DIAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: 
Urogenital System: incontinence, changes in libido, urinary retention Skin and Appendages: skin reactions Laboratories: elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase Other: changes in salivation, 
including dry mouth, hypersalivation Antegrade amnesia may occur using therapeutic dosages, the risk increasing at higher dosages. Amnestic effects may be associated with inappropriate behavior. Minor
changes in EEG patterns, usually low-voltage fast activity, have been observed in patients during and after diazepam tablets therapy and are of no known significance. Because of isolated reports of 
neutropenia and jaundice, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy. Postmarketing Experience Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications There have been
reports of falls and fractures in benzodiazepine users. The risk is increased in those taking concomitant sedatives (including alcohol), and in the elderly.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In studies in which mice and rats were administered diazepam in the 
diet at a dose of 75 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 and 12 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD = 1 mg/kg/day] on a mg/m 2 basis) for 80 and 104 weeks, respectively, an increased 
incidence of liver tumors was observed in males of both species. The data currently available are inadequate to determine the mutagenic potential of diazepam. Reproduction studies in rats showed 
decreases in the number of pregnancies and in the number of surviving offspring following administration of an oral dose of 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 16 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis) prior to 
and during mating and throughout gestation and lactation. DIAZEPAM: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: No adverse effects on fertility or offspring viability were noted at a 
dose of 80 mg/kg/day (approximately 13 times the MRHD on a mg/m 2 basis).         
SOURCE:DIAZEPAM label


CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: warnings: WARNINGS Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Concomitant use of benzodiazepiones, including diazepam tablets, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory 
depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have 
demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe diazepam 
tablets concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and 
sedation. In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of diazepam tablets than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. 
DIAZEPAM: warnings: If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking diazepam tablets, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response. Advise both patients 
and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when diazepam tablets are used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of 
concomitant use with the opioid have been determined (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction The use of benzodiazepines, including diazepam tablets, exposes users to the 
risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. DIAZEPAM: warnings: Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the 
maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, 
including respiratory depression, overdose, or death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse ). Before prescribing diazepam tablets and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, 
misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening tool). Use of diazepam tablets, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of 
diazepam tablets along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other 
substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Side effects most commonly reported were drowsiness, fatigue, muscle weakness, and ataxia. The following have also been reported: Central 
Nervous System: confusion, depression, dysarthria, headache, slurred speech, tremor, vertigo Gastrointestinal System: constipation, nausea, gastrointestinal disturbances Special Senses: blurred 
vision, diplopia, dizziness Cardiovascular System: hypotension Psychiatric and Paradoxical Reactions: stimulation, restlessness, acute hyperexcited states, anxiety, agitation, aggressiveness, 
irritability, rage, hallucinations, psychoses, delusions, increased muscle spasticity, insomnia, sleep disturbances, and nightmares. Inappropriate behavior and other adverse behavioral effects have 
been reported when using benzodiazepines. Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued. They are more likely to occur in children and in the elderly. DIAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: 
Urogenital System: incontinence, changes in libido, urinary retention Skin and Appendages: skin reactions Laboratories: elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase Other: changes in salivation, 
including dry mouth, hypersalivation Antegrade amnesia may occur using therapeutic dosages, the risk increasing at higher dosages. Amnestic effects may be associated with inappropriate behavior. Minor
changes in EEG patterns, usually low-voltage fast activity, have been observed in patients during and after diazepam tablets therapy and are of no known significance. Because of isolated reports of 
neutropenia and jaundice, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable during long-term therapy. Postmarketing Experience Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications There have been
reports of falls and fractures in benzodiazepine users. The risk is increased in those taking concomitant sedatives (including alcohol), and in the elderly.

CONTENT: DIAZEPAM: risks: Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see WARNINGS: 
Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear 
association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data ). Diazepam has been shown to be teratogenic in mice and hamsters when given orally at daily doses of 100 mg/kg or greater 
(approximately eight times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD=1 mg/kg/day] or greater on a mg/m 2 basis). Cleft palate and encephalopathy are the most common and consistently reported 
malformations produced in these species by administration of high, maternally toxic doses of diazepam during organogenesis. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated
population is unknown. DIAZEPAM: risks: All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth 
defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

question about whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.

The FDAHandler, which is the source I have access to for FDA data, did not provide an answer to the inquiry about the relationship between DIAZEPAM and the risk of aplastic anemia. This lack of 
information from the FDAHandler means that I do not have access to FDA label data that specifies whether DIAZEPAM has an effect on the risk of aplastic anemia. Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable 
answer based on the data available to me.

Without specific information from the FDA label data, I cannot comment on the strength of evidence or the magnitude of the effect of DIAZEPAM on the risk of aplastic anemia. It is possible that this 
information is not included in the FDA label, or that the relationship has not been sufficiently studied or established to be included in the label.

In summary, due to the absence of information from the FDAHandler, I am unable to determine whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. The reliability of the answer is 
limited to the data available, which in this case is none. Therefore, the final answer must be "DO-NOT-KNOW" with the justification that the FDA label data does not specify the answer.

        Do one of the following:

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.
            DO NOT REPEAT your original message; ONLY specify the 
            `intended_recipient` via this tool/function-call.
        2. If you are ready to have the critic check your answer,
            do so with the `final_answer` tool/function, as I have requested.
        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
        else to say, you MUST EXIT IMMEDIATELY by stating that you are done
        with the usual code (as in #3).

The question was whether DIAZEPAM increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. I attempted to obtain this information from the FDAHandler, which provides data from FDA labels. However, the 
FDAHandler did not provide an answer to the inquiry. Without specific information from the FDA label data, I cannot comment on the strength of evidence or the magnitude of the effect of DIAZEPAM on 
the risk of aplastic anemia. Therefore, the final answer is "DO-NOT-KNOW" because the FDA label data does not specify the answer.
