                Passages:
                1. Drug ALENDRONATE SODIUM: The FDA label for Alendronate Sodium does not specify information regarding the risk of angioedema associated with its use. Therefore, it is not possible to
determine from this source whether Alendronate Sodium increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.

 DO-NOT-KNOW

The justification for this answer is that the FDA label data, as provided by FDAHandler, does not contain information about the effect of Alendronate Sodium on the risk of angioedema. Without this 
specific information, it is not possible to provide a reliable answer to the question of whether Alendronate Sodium increases or decreases the risk of angioedema.
2. Drug ALENDRONATE: ALENDRONATE increases the risk of angioedema. This is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which cited the ALENDRONATE label indicating that hypersensitivity reactions
including urticaria and angioedema have been reported.

                Does the alendronate category of drugs increase the risk of
                angioedema, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for Alendronate Sodium does not specify information regarding the risk of angioedema, making it impossible to determine its effect from this source.
2. The FDAHandler indicates that Alendronate increases the risk of angioedema, as hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria and angioedema have been reported.
3. Since Alendronate Sodium and Alendronate belong to the same category of drugs and there is a report of increased risk of angioedema for Alendronate, it is reasonable to infer that the category as a
whole may have this risk associated with it, despite the lack of specific information for Alendronate Sodium.
        -----
        Final answer: The alendronate category of drugs increases the risk of angioedema.

        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for Alendronate Sodium does not provide information regarding the risk of angioedema, which means there is no evidence from this source to suggest an increase or decrease in 
risk.
2. The FDAHandler indicates that Alendronate, which is within the same category as Alendronate Sodium, does increase the risk of angioedema as hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria and

3. Given that Alendronate is reported to increase the risk of angioedema, and it is within the same drug category as Alendronate Sodium, the category as a whole is considered to potentially have this 
risk, despite the lack of specific information for Alendronate Sodium.
4. The evidence from FDAHandler for Alendronate is used to infer the risk for the category, as drug categories often share similar side effect profiles.
