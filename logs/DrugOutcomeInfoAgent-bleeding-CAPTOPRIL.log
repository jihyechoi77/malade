CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Hydrochlorothiazide : Two-year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology 
Program (NTP) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice (at doses of up to approximately 600 mg/kg/day) or in male and female rats (at doses of up to 
approximately 100 mg/kg/day). The NTP, however, found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice. Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in in vitro assays using strains TA 98, TA 100, 
TA 1535, TA 1537 and TA 1538 of Salmonella typhimurium (Ames assay) and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) test for chromosomal aberrations, or in vivo assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes, 
Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes, and the Drosophilia sex linked recessive lethal trait gene. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Positive test results were obtained only in the in vitro CHO Sister 
Chromatid Exchange (clastogenicity) and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell (mutagenicity) assays, using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide from 43 to 1300 mcg/mL, and in the Aspergillus nidulans 
non-disjunction assay at an unspecified concentration. Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed, via 
their diet, to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg/kg, respectively, prior to conception and throughout gestation. Animal Toxicology Captopril : Chronic oral toxicity studies were conducted in rats (2 years),
dogs (47 weeks; 1 year), mice (2 years), and monkeys (1 year). Significant drug-related toxicity included effects on hematopoiesis, renal toxicity, erosion/ulceration of the stomach, and variation of 
retinal blood vessels. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Reductions in hemoglobin and/or hematocrit values were seen in mice, rats, and monkeys at doses 50 to 150 times the maximum recommended human dose 
(MRHD). Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and bone marrow suppression occurred in dogs at doses 8 to 30 times MRHD. The reductions in hemoglobin and hematocrit values in rats and mice were only 
significant at 1 year and returned to normal with continued dosing by the end of the study. Marked anemia was seen at all dose levels (8 to 30 times MRHD) in dogs, whereas moderate to marked 
leukopenia was noted only at 15 and 30 times MRHD and thrombocytopenia at 30 times MRHD. The anemia could be reversed upon discontinuation of dosing. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Bone marrow suppression 
occurred to a varying degree, being associated only with dogs that died or were sacrificed in a moribund condition in the 1 year study. However, in the 47-week study at a dose 30 times MRHD, bone 
marrow suppression was found to be reversible upon continued drug administration. Captopril caused hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidneys at doses 7 to 200 times the MRHD in rats 
and mice, at 20 to 60 times MRHD in monkeys, and at 30 times the MRHD in dogs. Gastric erosions/ulcerations were increased in incidence at 20 and 200 times MRHD in male rats and at 30 and 65 times 
MRHD in dogs and monkeys, respectively. Rabbits developed gastric and intestinal ulcers when given oral doses approximately 30 times MRHD for only five to seven days. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: In the 
two-year rat study, irreversible and progressive variations in the caliber of retinal vessels (focal sacculations and constrictions) occurred at all dose levels (7 to 200 times MRHD) in a dose-related
fashion. The effect was first observed in the 88 th week of dosing, with a progressively increased incidence thereafter, even after cessation of dosing. Pregnancy Categories C (first trimester) and D 
(second and third trimesters): See WARNINGS: Captopril: Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality . Pregnancy: Nonteratogenic Effects: Hydrochlorothiazide : Thiazides cross the placental barrier and 
appear in cord blood. The use of thiazides in pregnant women requires that the anticipated benefit be weighed against possible hazards to the fetus. These hazards include fetal or neonatal jaundice, 
thrombocytopenia, and possibly other adverse reactions which have occurred in the adult. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Nursing Mothers Both captopril and hydrochlorothiazide are excreted in human milk. 
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from both drugs, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue therapy taking into account the 
importance of captopril and hydrochlorothiazide to the mother. (See PRECAUTIONS: Pediatric Use. ) Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. There is 
limited experience reported in the literature with the use of captopril in the pediatric population; dosage, on a weight basis, was generally reported to be comparable to or less than that used in 
adults. Infants, especially newborns, may be more susceptible to the adverse hemodynamic effects of captopril. Excessive, prolonged and un-predictable decreases in blood pressure and associated 
complications, including oliguria and seizures, have been reported. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Captopril and hydrochlorothiazide should be used in pediatric patients only if other measures for 
controlling blood pressure have not been effective.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Swelling confined to the face, mucous membranes of the mouth, lips and extremities has usually resolved with discontinuation of treatment; some cases required medical 
therapy. (See PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients and ADVERSE REACTIONS: Captopril .) Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors. These 
patients presented with abdominal pain (with or without nausea or vomiting); in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. The angioedema was 
diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, or at surgery, and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential 
diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Anaphylactoid Reactions During Desensitization : Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with 
hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life-threatening anaphylactoid reactions. In the same patients, these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld, 
but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure : Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients dialyzed with high-flux membranes and 
treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor. Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low-density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption. 
Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis : Neutropenia (< 1000/mm 3 ) with myeloid hypoplasia has resulted from use of captopril. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: About half of the neutropenic patients developed systemic or 
oral cavity infections or other features of the syndrome of agranulocytosis. The risk of neutropenia is dependent on the clinical status of the patient: In clinical trials in patients with 
hypertension who have normal renal function (serum creatinine less than 1.6 mg/dL and no collagen vascular disease), neutropenia has been seen in one patient out of over 8,600 exposed. In patients 
with some degree of renal failure (serum creatinine at least 1.6 mg/dL) but no collagen vascular disease, the risk of neutropenia in clinical trials was about 1 per 500, a frequency over 15 times that
for uncomplicated hypertension. Daily doses of captopril were relatively high in these patients, particularly in view of their diminished renal function. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: In foreign marketing 
experience in patients with renal failure, use of allopurinol concomitantly with captopril has been associated with neutropenia but this association has not appeared in U.S. reports. In patients with 
collagen vascular diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma) and impaired renal function, neutropenia occurred in 3.7 percent of patients in clinical trials. While none of the over 750
patients in formal clinical trials of heart failure developed neutropenia, it has occurred during the subsequent clinical experience. About half of the reported cases had serum creatinine ≥ 1.6 mg/dL 
and more than 75 percent were in patients also receiving procainamide. In heart failure, it appears that the same risk factors for neutropenia are present. The neutropenia has usually been detected 
within three months after captopril was started. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Bone marrow examinations in patients with neutropenia consistently showed myeloid hypoplasia, frequently accompanied by erythroid 
hypoplasia and decreased numbers of megakaryocytes (e.g., hypoplastic bone marrow and pancytopenia); anemia and thrombocytopenia were sometimes seen. In general, neutrophils returned to normal in 
about two weeks after captopril was discontinued, and serious infections were limited to clinically complex patients. About 13 percent of the cases of neutropenia have ended fatally, but almost all 
fatalities were in patients with serious illness, having collagen vascular disease, renal failure, heart failure or immunosuppressant therapy, or a combination of these complicating factors. 
Evaluation of the hypertensive or heart failure patient should always include assessment of renal function. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: If captopril is used in patients with impaired renal function, white 
blood cell and differential counts should be evaluated prior to starting treatment and at approximately two-week intervals for about three months, then periodically. In patients with collagen vascular
disease or who are exposed to other drugs known to affect the white cells or immune response, particularly when there is impaired renal function, captopril should be used only after an assessment of 
benefit and risk, and then with caution. All patients treated with captopril should be told to report any signs of infection (e.g., sore throat, fever). If infection is suspected, white cell counts 
should be performed without delay. Since discontinuation of captopril and other drugs has generally led to prompt return of the white count to normal, upon confirmation of neutropenia (neutrophil 
count < 1000/mm 3 ) the physician should withdraw captopril and closely follow the patient’s course. CAPTOPRIL: warnings: Proteinuria : Total urinary proteins greater than 1 g per day were seen in 
about 0.7 percent of patients receiving captopril. About 90 percent of affected patients had evidence of prior renal disease or received relatively high doses of captopril (in excess of 150 mg/day), 
or both. The nephrotic syndrome occurred in about one-fifth of proteinuric patients. In most cases, proteinuria subsided or cleared within six months whether or not captopril was continued. Parameters
of renal function, such as BUN and creatinine, were seldom altered in the patients with proteinuria. Hypotension : Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in hypertensive patients but is a possible 
consequence of captopril use in salt/volume depleted persons (such as those treated vigorously with diuretics), patients with heart failure or those patients undergoing renal dialysis. (See

blurred vision. Urogenital : impotence. As with other ACE inhibitors, a syndrome has been reported which may include: fever, myalgia, arthralgia, interstitial nephritis, vasculitis, rash or other 
dermatologic manifestations, eosinophilia and an elevated ESR. Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality: See WARNINGS: Captopril: Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality . Hydrochlorothiazide : 
Gastrointestinal System : anorexia, gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting, cramping, diarrhea, constipation, jaundice (intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice), pancreatitis, and sialadenitis. CAPTOPRIL: 
adverse_reactions: Central Nervous System : dizziness, vertigo, paresthesias, headache, and xanthopsia. Hematologic : leukopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, and hemolytic 
anemia. Cardiovascular : orthostatic hypotension. Hypersensitivity : purpura, photosensitivity, rash, urticaria, necrotizing angiitis (vasculitis; cutaneous vasculitis), fever, respiratory distress 
including pneumonitis, and anaphylactic reactions. Other : hyperglycemia, glycosuria, hyperuricemia, muscle spasm, weakness, restlessness, and transient blurred vision. Whenever adverse reactions are 
moderate or severe, thiazide dosage should be reduced or therapy withdrawn. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Altered Laboratory Findings: Serum Electrolytes : Hyperkalemia: small increases in serum 
potassium, especially in patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS: Captopril ). Hyponatremia : particularly in patients receiving a low sodium diet or concomitant diuretics. BUN/Serum 
Creatinine : Transient elevations of BUN or serum creatinine especially in volume or salt depleted patients or those with renovascular hypertension may occur. Rapid reduction of longstanding or 
markedly elevated blood pressure can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate and, in turn, lead to increases in BUN or serum creatinine. Hematologic : A positive ANA has been reported. 
Liver Function Tests : Elevations of liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have occurred. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Postmarketing Experience : Non-melanoma Skin Cancer : 
Hydrochlorothiazide is associated with an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer. In a study conducted in the Sentinel System, increased risk was predominantly for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 
and in white patients taking large cumulative doses. The increased risk for SCC in the overall population was approximately 1 additional case per 16,000 patients per year, and for white patients 
taking a cumulative dose of ≥ 50,000 mg the risk increase was approximately 1 additional SCC case for every 6,700 patients per year. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rising Pharma

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: precautions: The possibility of hypotensive effects with captopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake approximately one week prior 
to initiation of treatment with captopril or initiating therapy with small doses (6.25 or 12.5 mg). Alternatively, provide medical supervision for at least one hour after the initial dose. If 
hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. This transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication
to further doses which can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume expansion. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: Agents Having Vasodilator Activity : Data on the effect of 
concomitant use of other vasodilators in patients receiving captopril for heart failure are not available; therefore, nitroglycerin or other nitrates (as used for management of angina) or other drugs 
having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting captopril. If resumed during captopril therapy, such agents should be administered cautiously, and perhaps at lower 
dosage. Agents Causing Renin Release : Captopril’s effect will be augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release. For example, diuretics (e.g., thiazides) may activate the 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Agents Affecting Sympathetic Activity : The sympathetic nervous system may be especially important in supporting blood pressure in patients receiving captopril 
alone or with diuretics. Therefore, agents affecting sympathetic activity (e. CAPTOPRIL: precautions: ., ganglionic blocking agents or adrenergic neuron blocking agents) should be used with caution. 
Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs add some further antihypertensive effect to captopril, but the overall response is less than additive. Agents Increasing Serum Potassium : Since captopril decreases 
aldosterone production, elevation of serum potassium may occur. Potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride, or potassium supplements, should be given only for 
documented hypokalemia, and then with caution, since they may lead to a significant increase of serum potassium. Salt substitutes containing potassium should also be used with caution. CAPTOPRIL: 
drug_interactions: Gold : Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium 
aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including captopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Inhibitors of Endogenous Prostaglandin Synthesis : It has been reported that indomethacin may
reduce the antihypertensive effect of captopril, especially in cases of low renin hypertension. Other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., aspirin) may also have this effect. Lithium : 
Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with 
caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. CAPTOPRIL: drug_interactions: If a diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug 
Interactions: Hydrochlorothiazide: Lithium ). Hydrochlorothiazide : When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics: Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics : 
potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur. Amphotericin B, Corticosteroids, or Corticotropin (ACTH) : may intensify electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia. Monitor potassium levels; 
use potassium replacements if necessary. Anticoagulants (Oral) : dosage adjustments of anticoagulant medication may be necessary since hydrochlorothiazide may decrease their effects. Antigout 
Medications : dosage adjustments of antigout medication may be necessary since hydrochlorothiazide may raise the level of blood uric acid. Other Antihypertensive Medications (e. CAPTOPRIL: 
drug_interactions: Drug Interactions: Captopril : Hypotension—Patients On Diuretic Therapy : Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, as well as 
those on severe dietary salt restrictions or dialysis, may occasionally experience a precipitous reduction of blood pressure usually within the first hour after receiving the initial dose of 
captopril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with captopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake approximately one week prior to initiation of 
treatment with captopril or initiating therapy with small doses (6.25 or 12.5 mg). Alternatively, provide medical supervision for at least one hour after the initial dose. If hypotension occurs, the 
patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. CAPTOPRIL: drug_interactions: This transient hypotensive response is not a 
contraindication to further doses which can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume expansion. Agents Having Vasodilator Activity : Data on the effect of 
concomitant use of other vasodilators in patients receiving captopril for heart failure are not available; therefore, nitroglycerin or other nitrates (as used for management of angina) or other drugs 
having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting captopril. If resumed during captopril therapy, such agents should be administered cautiously, and perhaps at lower 
dosage. Agents Causing Renin Release : Captopril’s effect will be augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release. For example, diuretics (e.g., thiazides) may activate the

SOURCE:CAPTOPRIL label


CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II and increased plasma renin activity (PRA), the latter resulting from loss of negative feedback 
on renin release caused by reduction in angiotensin II. The reduction of angiotensin II leads to decreased aldosterone secretion, and, as a result, small increases in serum potassium may occur along 
with sodium and fluid loss. The antihypertensive effects persist for a longer period of time than does demonstrable inhibition of circulating ACE. It is not known whether the ACE present in vascular 
endothelium is inhibited longer than the ACE in circulating blood. Pharmacokinetics: After oral administration of therapeutic doses of captopril, rapid absorption occurs with peak blood levels at 
about one hour. The presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract reduces absorption by about 30 to 40 percent; captopril therefore should be given one hour before meals. Based on carbon-14 labeling,
average minimal absorption is approximately 75 percent. CAPTOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: In a 24-hour period, over 95 percent of the absorbed dose is eliminated in the urine; 40 to 50 percent is 
unchanged drug; most of the remainder is the disulfide dimer of captopril and captopril-cysteine disulfide. Approximately 25 to 30 percent of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins. The 
apparent elimination half-life for total radioactivity in blood is probably less than three hours. An accurate determination of half-life of unchanged captopril is not, at present, possible, but it is
probably less than two hours. In patients with renal impairment, however, retention of captopril occurs (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Pharmacodynamics: Administration of captopril results in a 
reduction of peripheral arterial resistance in hypertensive patients with either no change, or an increase, in cardiac output. There is an increase in renal blood flow following administration of 
captopril and glomerular filtration rate is usually unchanged. CAPTOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: In patients with heart failure, significantly decreased peripheral (systemic vascular) resistance and 
blood pressure (afterload), reduced pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload) and pulmonary vascular resistance, increased cardiac output, and increased exercise tolerance time (ETT) have been 
demonstrated. Reductions of blood pressure are usually maximal 60 to 90 minutes after oral administration of an individual dose of captopril. The duration of effect is dose related and is extended in 
the presence of a thiazide-type diuretic. The full effect of a given dose may not be attained for 6 to 8 weeks (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). The blood pressure lowering effects of captopril and 
thiazide-type diuretics are additive. In contrast, captopril and beta-blockers have a less than additive effect. Blood pressure is lowered to about the same extent in both standing and supine 
positions. CAPTOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Orthostatic effects and tachycardia are infrequent but may occur in volume-depleted patients. Abrupt withdrawal of captopril has not been associated with a
rapid increase in blood pressure. Studies in rats and cats indicate that captopril does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent. Hydrochlorothiazide : Thiazides affect the renal 
tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption. At maximal therapeutic dosage all thiazides are approximately equal in their diuretic potency. Thiazides increase excretion of sodium and chloride in 
approximately equivalent amounts. Natriuresis causes a secondary loss of potassium and bicarbonate. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown. Thiazides do not affect normal
blood pressure. The mean plasma half-life of hydrochlorothiazide in fasted individuals has been reported to be approximately 2.5 hours. CAPTOPRIL: clinical_pharmacology: Onset of diuresis occurs in 
two hours and the peak effect at about four hours. Its action persists for approximately six to twelve hours. Hydrochlorothiazide is eliminated rapidly by the kidney.

CONTENT: CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Captopril : Reported incidences are based on clinical trials involving approximately 7000 patients. Renal : About one of 100 patients developed
proteinuria (see WARNINGS ). Each of the following has been reported in approximately 1 to 2 of 1000 patients and are of uncertain relationship to drug use: renal insufficiency, renal failure, 
nephrotic syndrome, polyuria, oliguria, and urinary frequency. Hematologic : Neutropenia/agranulocytosis has occurred (see WARNINGS ). Cases of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia have been 
reported. Dermatologic : Rash, often with pruritus, and sometimes with fever, arthralgia, and eosinophilia, occurred in about 4 to 7 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients, usually 
during the first four weeks of therapy. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: It is usually maculopapular, and rarely urticarial. The rash is usually mild and disappears within a few days of dosage reduction,
short-term treatment with an antihistaminic agent, and/or discontinuing therapy; remission may occur even if captopril is continued. Pruritus, without rash, occurs in about 2 of 100 patients. Between 
7 and 10 percent of patients with skin rash have shown eosinophilia and/or positive ANA titers. A reversible associated pemphigoid-like lesion, and photosensitivity, have also been reported. Flushing 
or pallor has been reported in 2 to 5 of 1000 patients. Cardiovascular : Hypotension may occur; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS (Drug Interactions) for discussion of hypotension with captopril therapy. 
Tachycardia, chest pain, and palpitations have each been observed in approximately 1 of 100 patients. CAPTOPRIL: adverse_reactions: Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, Raynaud’s syndrome, and 
congestive heart failure have each occurred in 2 to 3 of 1000 patients. Dysgeusia : Approximately 2 to 4 (depending on renal status and dose) of 100 patients developed a diminution or loss of taste 
perception. Taste impairment is reversible and usually self-limited (2 to 3 months) even with continued drug administration. Weight loss may be associated with the loss of taste. Angioedema : 
Angioedema involving the extremities, face, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis or larynx has been reported in approximately one in 1000 patients. Angioedema involving the upper airways has caused
fatal airway obstruction. (See WARNINGS: Captopril: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema and PRECAUTIONS: Information for Patients ).

ANSWER: The information available in the CAPTOPRIL label does not directly address the risk of bleeding. However, it does mention hematologic adverse reactions such as neutropenia/agranulocytosis, 
anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia. Thrombocytopenia, which is a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, could potentially increase the risk of bleeding, although the label does not 
explicitly state that CAPTOPRIL increases the risk of bleeding.

        Question: Does CAPTOPRIL increase or decrease the risk of bleeding?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether CAPTOPRIL increases or decreases the risk of bleeding.
2. FDAHandler responded that the CAPTOPRIL label does not directly address the risk of bleeding but does mention hematologic adverse reactions such as neutropenia/agranulocytosis, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia.
3. Thrombocytopenia, which is a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood, could potentially increase the risk of bleeding, although the label does not explicitly state that CAPTOPRIL increases
the risk of bleeding.
        -----
        Final answer: The CAPTOPRIL label does not directly state that the drug increases the risk of bleeding. However, it does list thrombocytopenia as a potential adverse reaction, which could 
increase the risk of bleeding. The degree of risk associated with CAPTOPRIL in terms of causing bleeding is not specified in the label, and therefore, the relationship is not definitively established.

The final answer to the question "Does CAPTOPRIL increase or decrease the risk of bleeding?" is as follows:

The CAPTOPRIL label does not directly state that the drug increases the risk of bleeding. However, it does list thrombocytopenia as a potential adverse reaction, which could increase the risk of 
bleeding. The degree of risk associated with CAPTOPRIL in terms of causing bleeding is not specified in the label, and therefore, the relationship is not definitively established.
