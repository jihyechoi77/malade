[31mappears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely[0m

[31mcases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Haloperidol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the [0m
[31mfetus. HALOPERIDOL: warnings: Rodents given [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m to [0m[1;31m20[0m[31m times the usual maximum human dose of haloperidol by oral or parenteral routes showed an increase in incidence of resorption, reduced fertility, [0m
[31mdelayed delivery and pup mortality. No teratogenic effect has been reported in rats, rabbits or dogs at dosages within this range, but cleft palate has been observed in mice given [0m[1;31m15[0m[31m times the usual [0m
[31mmaximum human dose. Cleft palate in mice appears to be a nonspecific response to stress or nutritional imbalance as well as to a variety of drugs, and there is no evidence to relate this phenomenon to[0m
[31mpredictable human risk for most of these agents. There are no well controlled studies with haloperidol in pregnant women. There are reports, however, of cases of limb malformations observed following [0m
[31mmaternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy. Causal relationships were not established in these cases. [0m

[31mGeneral A number of cases of bronchopneumonia, some fatal, have followed the use of antipsychotic drugs, including haloperidol. It has been postulated that lethargy and decreased sensation of thirst [0m
[31mdue to central inhibition may lead to dehydration, hemoconcentration and reduced pulmonary ventilation. Therefore, if the above signs and symptoms appear, especially in the elderly, the physician [0m
[31mshould institute remedial therapy promptly. Although not reported with haloperidol, decreased serum cholesterol and/or cutaneous and ocular changes have been reported in patients receiving [0m
[31mchemically-related drugs. Haloperidol may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. The [0m
[31mambulatory patient should be warned accordingly. The use of alcohol with this drug should be avoided due to possible additive effects and hypotension.         [0m

[31mfurther evidence becomes available, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of haloperidol. Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents, haloperidol has been associated with persistent [0m
[31mdyskinesias. Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may occur after drug therapy [0m

[31mreported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of [0m

[32mThe FDA label for HALOPERIDOL does not specifically mention an increased risk of aplastic anemia. However, it does note a risk of agranulocytosis, which is a different but severe condition involving a[0m
[32mreduction in white blood cell count. Therefore, based on the FDA label, we cannot conclusively say that HALOPERIDOL increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.[0m
