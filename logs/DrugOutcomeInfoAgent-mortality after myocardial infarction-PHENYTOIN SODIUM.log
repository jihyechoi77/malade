[31mcritically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying [0m

[32mThe final answer to the question [0m[32m"Does PHENYTOIN SODIUM increase or decrease the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction?"[0m[32m is that PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of mortality after [0m
[32mmyocardial infarction due to its association with severe cardiovascular events, including cardiac arrhythmias and death. This conclusion is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which [0m
[32mindicates that Phenytoin Sodium has been associated with these severe cardiovascular events, particularly in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and those with severe myocardial insufficiency, [0m
