CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral doxycycline's virtually complete absorption, side effects of the lower bowel, particularly diarrhea, have been 
infrequent. The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines: Gastrointestinal: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, glossitis, dysphagia, enterocolitis, 
inflammatory lesions (with monilial overgrowth) in the anogenital region, and pancreatitis. Hepatotoxicity has been reported rarely. These reactions have been caused by both the oral and parenteral 
administration of tetracyclines. Superficial discoloration of the adult permanent dentition, reversible upon drug discontinuation and professional dental cleaning has been reported. Permanent tooth 
discoloration and enamel hypoplasia may occur with drugs of the tetracycline class when used during tooth development. (See WARNINGS . DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ) Rare instances of 
esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving capsule and tablet forms of the drugs in the tetracycline class. Most of these patients took medications immediately 
before going to bed. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .) Skin: toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, skin hyperpigmentation, maculopapular and erythematous rashes. 
Exfoliative dermatitis has been reported but is uncommon. Photosensitivity is discussed above. (See WARNINGS .) Renal toxicity: Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose related. (See 
WARNINGS . DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: adverse_reactions: ) Immune: Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid purpura, serum sickness, pericarditis, 
exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction has been reported in the setting of spirochete 
infections treated with doxycycline. Blood: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and eosinophilia have been reported. Other: Bulging fontanels in infants and intracranial hypertension in 
adults. (See WARNINGS .) When given over prolonged periods, tetracyclines have been reported to produce brown-black microscopic discoloration of the thyroid gland. No abnormalities of thyroid function
studies are known to occur.

CONTENT: DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: WARNINGS The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause 
permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drugs, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel
hypoplasia has also been reported. Use doxycycline in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life-threatening 
conditions (e.g., anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), particularly when there are no alternative therapies. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly 
all antibacterial agents, including doxycycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to 
overgrowth of C. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause 
increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following
the use of antibacterial drugs. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or 
confirmed, ongoing use of antibacterial drugs not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial 
treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema 
multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline. (See ADVERSE 
REACTIONS .) If severe skin reactions occur, doxycycline should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted. Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been 
associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women
of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Concomitant use of isotretinoin and 
doxycycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual 
loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients 
should be monitored until they stabilize. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in prematures given oral 
tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are 
found in fetal tissues, and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus (often related to retardation of skeletal development). DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE: warnings: Evidence of embryotoxicity has also 
been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy. If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the 
potential hazard to the fetus. The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with
impaired renal function. Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or 
ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.

DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE can increase the risk of angioedema. This information is based on the FDA label for DOXYCYCLINE HYCLATE, which lists angioedema as one of the possible hypersensitivity reactions 
reported with its use.
