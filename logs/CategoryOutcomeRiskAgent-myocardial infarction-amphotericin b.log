[34mThe question was whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of myocardial infarction. I attempted to use the recipient_message tool to ask FDAHandler for information regarding the effects of [0m
[34mAMBISOME on the risk of myocardial infarction. However, due to a technical issue, I did not receive any response from FDAHandler. Without specific data from the FDA, I cannot provide a reliable answer[0m
