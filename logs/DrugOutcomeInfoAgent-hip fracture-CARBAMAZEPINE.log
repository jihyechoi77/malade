[32mThe FDA label for CARBAMAZEPINE does not specifically mention an increased or decreased risk of hip fracture. However, it does note that carbamazepine can cause bone loss and decreased levels of [0m
[32mplasma calcium, which can lead to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a known risk factor for fractures, including hip fractures. Therefore, while not directly stated, there is an implication that [0m
[32mcarbamazepine may potentially increase the risk of hip fractures due to its effects on bone health.[0m
