                Passages:
                1. Drug PHENYTOIN SODIUM: PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of acute liver injury. Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been 
reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) or may occur in isolation. Manifestations include jaundice, 
hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In patients with 
acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered.
2. Drug PHENYTOIN: PHENYTOIN can increase the risk of acute liver injury. Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These 
events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) or may occur in isolation. Manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum 
transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course can range from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In cases of acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately 
discontinued and not re-administered.
3. Drug EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of acute liver injury. Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been 
reported with phenytoin sodium. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) or may occur in isolation. Manifestations include jaundice, 
hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course can range from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In cases of acute hepatotoxicity, the drug 
should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. This information is based on the EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label provided by FDAHandler.

                Does the phenytoin category of drugs increase the risk of
                acute liver injury, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the phenytoin category of drugs increase the risk of acute liver injury, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. All three passages consistently report that drugs in the phenytoin category can increase the risk of acute liver injury.
2. The reported manifestations of hepatotoxicity include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia, indicating a clear association with liver injury.
3. The clinical course described ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes, which suggests a significant impact on liver health.
4. The recommendation to immediately discontinue and not re-administer the drug in cases of acute hepatotoxicity underscores the seriousness of the risk.
5. The information is based on labels provided by FDAHandler, which implies that the evidence is strong and derived from regulatory sources.
        -----
        Final answer: The phenytoin category of drugs increases the risk of acute liver injury.
