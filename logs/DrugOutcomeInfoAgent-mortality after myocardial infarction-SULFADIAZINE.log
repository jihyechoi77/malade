CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is a topical antimicrobial drug indicated as an adjunct for the prevention and treatment of wound 
sepsis in patients with second and third degree burns.         
SOURCE:SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: description: DESCRIPTION Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is a soft, white, water dispersible cream containing the antimicrobial agent silver sulfadiazine in micronized form 
for topical application. Each gram of silver sulfadiazine cream contains 10mg of micronized silver sulfadiazine. This active agent has the following structural formula: Silver sulfadiazine cream 
contains 1% w/w silver sulfadiazine. The vehicle in which the active ingredient is dispersed consists of water, stearyl alcohol, white petrolatum, polyoxyl 40 stearate, propylene glycol, isopropyl 
myristate, and sorbitan monooleate with 0.3% methylparaben as a preservative.         
SOURCE:SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to silver sulfadiazine or any of the other 
ingredients in the preparation. Because sulfonamide therapy is known to increase the possibility of kernicterus, silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should not be used on pregnant women approaching or 
at term, on premature infants, or on newborn infants during the first 2 months of life.         
SOURCE:SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category B. A reproductive study has been performed in rabbits at doses up to three to ten times the concentration of silver
sulfadiazine in silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% and has revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to silver sulfadiazine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant 
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly justified, especially in pregnant women approaching or
at term. SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: (See CONTRAINDICATIONS )

CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prompt institution of appropriate regimens for care of the burned patient is of prime importance and includes the control of
shock and pain. The burn wounds are then cleansed and debrided; silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is then applied under sterile conditions. The burn areas should be covered with silver sulfadiazine 
cream, USP 1% at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of approximately one sixteenth of an inch. Whenever necessary, the cream should be reapplied to any areas 
from which it has been removed by patient activity. Administration may be accomplished in minimal time because dressings are not required. However, if individual patient requirements make dressings 
necessary, they may be used. Reapply immediately after hydrotherapy. Treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should be continued until satisfactory healing has occurred or until the burn site
is ready for grafting. SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: The drug should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except if a significant 
adverse reaction occurs.         
SOURCE:SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: warnings: WARNINGS Absorption of silver sulfadiazine varies depending upon the percent of body surface area and the extent of the tissue damage. Although few have been reported,
it is possible that any adverse reaction associated with sulfonamides may occur. Some of the reactions which have been associated with sulfonamides are as follows: blood dyscrasias including 
agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hemolytic anemia; dermatologic and allergic reactions, including life-threatening cutaneous reactions [Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and exfoliative dermatitis]; gastrointestinal reactions, hepatitis and hepatocellular necrosis; CNS reactions; and toxic nephrosis. There is a potential 
cross-sensitivity between silver sulfadiazine and other sulfonamides. SULFADIAZINE: warnings: If allergic reactions attributable to treatment with silver sulfadiazine occur, continuation of therapy 
must be weighed against the potential hazards of the particular allergic reaction. Fungal proliferation in and below the eschar may occur. However, the incidence of clinically reported fungal 
superinfection is low. The use of silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% in some cases of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient individuals may be hazardous, as hemolysis may occur.

CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Silver sulfadiazine has broad antimicrobial activity. It is bactericidal for many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as well 
as being effective against yeast. Results from in vitro testing are listed below. Sufficient data have been obtained to demonstrate that silver sulfadiazine will inhibit bacteria that are resistant to
other antimicrobial agents and that the compound is superior to sulfadiazine. Studies utilizing radioactive micronized silver sulfadiazine, electron microscopy, and biochemical techniques have 
revealed that the mechanism of action of silver sulfadiazine on bacteria differs from silver nitrate and sodium sulfadiazine. Silver sulfadiazine acts only on the cell membrane and cell wall to 
produce its bactericidal effect. SULFADIAZINE: clinical_pharmacology: Results of in Vitro Testing With Silver Sulfadiazine Cream, USP 1% Concentration of Silver Sulfadiazine Number of Sensitive

that sulfadiazine, particularly in the form of silver sulfadiazine cream USP 1%, is used as a topical antimicrobial drug for the prevention and treatment of wound sepsis in patients with second and 
third degree burns. There is no mention of sulfadiazine's effect on mortality after myocardial infarction in the provided FDA label extract.

Given that the FDA label data does not specify the effect of sulfadiazine on mortality after myocardial infarction, my answer must be DO-NOT-KNOW. The FDA label for sulfadiazine does not provide 
information on its impact on mortality post-myocardial infarction, and therefore, I cannot determine whether it increases or decreases the risk of mortality in this context.

        Do one of the following:

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.
            DO NOT REPEAT your original message; ONLY specify the 
            `intended_recipient` via this tool/function-call.
        2. If you are ready to have the critic check your answer,
            do so with the `final_answer` tool/function, as I have requested.
        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
        else to say, you MUST EXIT IMMEDIATELY by stating that you are done
        with the usual code (as in #3).

of mortality in this context based on the available FDA label information.
