[1;31m3[0m[31m. Passage [0m[1;31m3[0m[31m mentions that the FDA label does not specify the risk of aplastic anemia associated with ABELCET, indicating a lack of evidence for an effect.[0m
[1;31m4[0m[31m. Since there is no evidence from the FDA labels that any of the drugs in the amphotericin b category increase the risk of aplastic anemia, and for two of the drugs, the effect is unknown due to lack[0m
