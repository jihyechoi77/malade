        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture.
2. FDAHandler responded that EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM may cause softening of the bones (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia), which can lead to fractures, including hip fractures.

EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM may increase the risk of hip fracture due to its potential to cause softening of the bones (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia), which can lead to fractures, 
including hip fractures. This information is based on the EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label provided by the FDA.
