CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic 
Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin sodium. Some of these events have been fatal or 
life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, 
nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, 
other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not 
evident. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued if an alternative
etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin sodium and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity  . 
Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same 
patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin sodium. 5. 
EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin sodium-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses
and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity  . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in 
patients treated with phenytoin sodium in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling 
occur. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including 
infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin sodium. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in
isolation . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges
from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications 
Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, 
agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between 
phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin’s disease. Although a cause and effect 
relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur
with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS  . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control 
using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, 
osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and 
decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as
appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients 
with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In 
view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: overdosage: 10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are 
nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia 
and cardiac arrest have been reported  . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity 
may occur. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: overdosage: Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 
mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 
mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory
and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total 
exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: overdosage: In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, 
including alcohol, should be borne in mind.

        Question: Does EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increase or decrease the risk of acute liver injury?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM increases or decreases the risk of acute liver injury.
2. FDAHandler responded that EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of acute liver injury. Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been 
reported with phenytoin sodium. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation with manifestations such as jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, 
leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course can range from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes, and in cases of acute hepatotoxicity, the drug should be immediately discontinued.
        -----
        Final answer: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of acute liver injury.

EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM can increase the risk of acute liver injury. Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin sodium. 
These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) or may occur in isolation. Manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum 
transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course can range from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In cases of acute hepatotoxicity, the drug should be immediately discontinued
and not readministered. This information is based on the EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label provided by FDAHandler.
