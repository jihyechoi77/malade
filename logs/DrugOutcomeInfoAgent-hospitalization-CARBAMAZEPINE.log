CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients 
was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four 
suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal 
thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the 
analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs
in the data analyzed. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used
for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 
- Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of 
Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.
CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: 9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other 
conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing carbamazepine extended-release capsules or any other AED must 
balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and 
mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these 
symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Hyponatremia, Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion, and Water Intoxication 
Hyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic 
hormone secretion (SIADH). The risk of developing SIADH with carbamazepine treatment may be dose-related. Elderly patients and patients treated with diuretics are at greater risk of developing 
hyponatremia. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, new or increased seizure frequency, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which can 
lead to falls. Consider discontinuing carbamazepine extended-release capsules in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia. Usage in Pregnancy Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including spina 
bifida. There have also been reports that associate carbamazepine with developmental disorders and congenital anomalies (e.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, and anomalies 
involving various body systems). Developmental delays have been reported. When treating or counseling women of childbearing potential, the prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of 
therapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. 
Retrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. 
Therefore, if therapy is to be continued, monotherapy may be preferable for pregnant women.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: These serious skin reactions are more likely to happen within the first four months of carbamazepine extended-release capsules treatment but may occur at later 
times. These reactions can happen in anyone, but are more likely in people of Asian descent. If you are of Asian descent you may need a genetic blood test before you take carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules to see if you are at a higher risk for serious skin reactions with this medicine. Symptoms may include: skin rash hives sores in your mouth blistering or peeling of the skin 
2. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules can also cause other types of allergic reactions or serious problems that may affect organs and other parts of your body such as your liver or blood cells. 
You may or may not have a rash when you get these types of reactions. CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms: swelling of your face, 
eyes, lips, or tongue trouble swallowing or breathing frequent fevers or fevers that do not go away frequent infections or an infection that does not go away unusual bruising or bleeding red or purple
spots on your body severe fatigue or weakness unexpected muscle pain that does not go away swollen glands that do not go away yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes loss of appetite 
(anorexia) that does not go away nausea or vomiting that does not go away These symptoms may be the first signs of a serious reaction. A healthcare provider should examine you to decide if you should 
continue taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. 3. Like other antiepileptic drugs, carbamazepine extended-release capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of 
people, about 1 in 500. CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: thoughts about suicide
or dying attempt to commit suicide new or worse depression new or worse anxiety feeling agitated or restless panic attacks trouble sleeping (insomnia) new or worse irritability acting aggressive, 
being angry, or violent acting on dangerous impulses an extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) other unusual changes in behavior or mood How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal 
thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call 
your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Do not stop carbamazepine extended-release capsules without first talking to a healthcare provider. 
Stopping carbamazepine extended-release capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you 
have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. What is carbamazepine extended-release capsule? Carbamazepine extended-release capsule is a medicine used to 
treat: certain types of seizures (partial, tonic-clonic, mixed) certain types of nerve pain (trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia). Carbamazepine extended-release capsule is not a regular pain 
medicine and should not be used for aches or pains. Who should not take carbamazepine extended-release capsules? Do not take carbamazepine extended-release capsules if you: have a history of bone 
marrow depression are allergic to carbamazepine or any of the ingredients in carbamazepine extended-release capsules. See the end of this Medication Guide for a complete list of ingredients in 
carbamazepine extended-release capsules. CARBAMAZEPINE: spl_medguide: take nefazodone take delavirdine are allergic to antidepressant medications called tricyclic (TCAs). have taken a medicine called 
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) in the last 14 days. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of these medicines if you are not sure. What should I tell my healthcare provider before 
taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules? Before you take carbamazepine extended-release capsules, tell your healthcare provider if you: have or ever had heart problems have or ever had blood 
problems have or ever had liver or kidney problems have or ever had allergic reactions to medicines have or ever had increased pressure in your eye have or have had suicidal thoughts or actions, 
depression or mood problems have any other medical conditions drink grapefruit juice or eat grapefruit use birth control. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may make your birth control less 
effective.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: dosage_and_administration: Maintenance: Adjust dosage to the minimum effective level, usually 800 to 1,200 mg daily. Children under 12 years of age: Children taking total daily
dosages of immediate-release carbamazepine of 400 mg or greater may be converted to the same total daily dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules, using a twice daily regimen. Ordinarily, 
optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 35 mg/kg. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in 
the therapeutic range. No recommendation regarding the safety of carbamazepine extended-release capsules for use at doses above 35 mg/kg/24 hours can be made. Combination Therapy: Carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules may be used alone or with other anticonvulsants. CARBAMAZEPINE: dosage_and_administration: When added to existing anticonvulsant therapy, the drug should be added gradually 
while the other anticonvulsants are maintained or gradually decreased, except phenytoin, which may have to be increased (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions ). Trigeminal Neuralgia (see INDICATIONS AND
USAGE ) Initial: On the first day, start with one 200 mg capsule. This daily dose may be increased by up to 200 mg/day every 12 hours only as needed to achieve freedom from pain. Do not exceed 1,200 
mg daily. Maintenance: Control of pain can be maintained in most patients with 400 to 800 mg daily. However, some patients may be maintained on as little as 200 mg daily, while others may require as 
much as 1200 mg daily. CARBAMAZEPINE: dosage_and_administration: At least once every 3 months throughout the treatment period, attempts should be made to reduce the dose to the minimum effective level
or even to discontinue the drug.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, voriconazole), cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, dalfopristin, danazol, dantrolene, delavirdine, diltiazem,
erythromycin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, grapefruit juice, ibuprofen, isoniazid, loratadine, macrolides, nefazodone, niacinamide, nicotinamide, olanzapine, omeprazole, oxybutynin, protease inhibitors, 
propoxyphene, quinine, quinupristin, ticlopidine, troleandomycin, valproate, verapamil, zileuton. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Human microsomal epoxide hydrolase has been identified as the enzyme
responsible for the formation of the 10,11-transdiol derivative from carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide. Coadministration of inhibitors of human microsomal epoxide hydrolase may result in increased 
carbamazepine-10,11 epoxide plasma concentrations. Accordingly, the dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules should be adjusted and/or the plasma levels monitored when used concomitantly with
loxapine, quetiapine, or valproic acid. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage of carbamazepine extended-release capsules, and then begins a course of treatment with one of these 
CYP3A4 or epoxide hydrolase inhibitors, it is reasonable to expect that a dose reduction for carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Agents that 
Induce Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes : Carbamazepine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, the potential exists for interaction between carbamazepine and any agent that induces CYP3A4. Agents that are CYP
inducers that have been found, or are expected, to decrease plasma levels of carbamazepine extended-release capsules include, for example, the following: Aminophylline, cisplatin, doxorubicin HCL, 
felbamate, fosphenytoin, methsuximide, phenobarbital, phenytoin( 1 ), primidone, rifampin and theophylline. (1) Phenytoin plasma levels have also been reported to increase and decrease in the presence
of carbamazepine, see below. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on carbamazepine extended-release capsules, and then begins a course of treatment
with one of these CYP3A4 inducers, it is reasonable to expect that a dose increase for carbamazepine extended-release capsules may be necessary. Agents with Decreased Levels in the Presence of 
Carbamazepine due to Induction of Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: Carbamazepine is a potent inducer of hepatic CYP3A4 and is also known to be an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and may therefore reduce plasma
concentrations of co-medications mainly metabolized by CYP 1A2, 2B6, 2C9/19 and 3A4, through induction of their metabolism. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: When used concomitantly with carbamazepine
extended-release capsules, monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment of these agents may be necessary: When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be doubled. 
Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. If carbamazepine is later withdrawn, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced. When carbamazepine is used with tacrolimus, monitoring 
of tacrolimus blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments are recommended. The use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers such as carbamazepine should be avoided with temsirolimus. If 
patients must be coadministered carbamazepine with temsirolimus, an adjustment of temsirolimus dosage should be considered. The use of carbamazepine with lapatinib should generally be avoided. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: If carbamazepine is started in a patient already taking lapatinib, the dose of lapatinib should be gradually titrated up. If carbamazepine is discontinued, the 
lapatinib dose should be reduced. Concomitant use of carbamazepine with nefazodone results in plasma concentrations of nefazodone and its active metabolite insufficient to achieve a therapeutic 
effect. Coadministration of carbamazepine with nefazodone is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Monitor concentrations of valproate when carbamazepine extended-release capsules are introduced 
or withdrawn in patients using valproic acid. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In addition, carbamazepine causes, or would be expected to cause, decreased levels of, for example, the following drugs,
for which monitoring of concentrations or dosage adjustment may be necessary: Acetaminophen, albendazole, alprazolam, aprepitant, buprenorphine, apixaban( 6 ), bupropion, buspirone, citalopram, 
clobazam, clonazepam, clozapine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone, dexamethasone), cyclosporin, dabigatran( 6 ), delavirdine, desipramine, diazepam, dicumarol, dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers (e.g. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: felodipine), doxycycline, edoxaban( 6 ), eslicarbazepine, ethosuximide, everolimus, felbamate, haloperidol, imatinib, itraconazole, lamotrigine, 
levothyroxine, lorazepam, methadone, methsuximide, midazolam, mirtazapine, nefazodone, nortriptyline, olanzapine, oral and other hormonal contraceptives( 2 ), oxcarbazepine, paliperidone, phenytoin( 3
), praziquantel, protease inhibitors, quetiapine, risperidone, rivaroxaban( 6 ), sertraline, sirolimus, tadalafil, theophylline, tiagabine, topiramate, tramadol, triazolam, trazodone CARBAMAZEPINE: 
drug_interactions: ( 4 ), tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline), valproate, warfarin (5) , ziprasidone, and zonisamide. ( 2 ) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with
hormonal contraceptive products (e.g., oral and levonorgestrel subdermal implant contraceptives) may render the contraceptives less effective because the plasma concentrations of the hormones may be 
decreased. Breakthrough bleeding and unintended pregnancies have been reported with carbamazepine. Alternative or back-up methods of contraception should be considered. ( 3 ) Phenytoin has also been 
reported to increase in the presence of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: ( 4 ) 
Following co-administration of carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced trough plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well as meta-chlorophenylpiperazine )
by 76 and 60% respectively, compared to precarbamazepine values. (5) Warfarin’s anticoagulant effect can be reduced in the presence of carbamazepine. (6) Concomitant use of carbamazepine with 
rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban (direct acting oral anticoagulants) is expected to result in decreased plasma concentrations of these anticoagulants that may be insufficient to achieve
the intended therapeutic effect. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: In general, coadministration of carbamazepine with rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban should be avoided. Thus, if a 
patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that 
a dose increase for the concomitant agent may be necessary. Agents with Increased Levels in the Presence of Carbamazepine Carbamazepine extended-release capsules increase the plasma levels of the 
following agents. Thus, if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of the treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules,
it is reasonable to expect that a dose decrease for the concomitant agent may be necessary. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Clomipramine HCl, Phenytoin( 7 ), and Primidone Carbamazepine 
extended-release capsules can increase the concentrations of clomipramine, phenytoin, and primidone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of these agents in this category, and then
begins treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these drugs. ( 7 )Phenytoin has also been reported to decrease in the presence of 
carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of phenytoin plasma levels following co-medication with carbamazepine is advised. Cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide is an inactive prodrug and is converted to its 
active metabolite in part by CYP3A. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide are reportedly increased by chronic co-administration of 
CYP3A4 inducers. There is a potential for increased cyclophosphamide toxicity when coadministered with carbamazepine. Pharmacological/Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Carbamazepine: Delavirdine 
Coadministration of carbamazepine with delavirdine may lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to delavirdine or to the class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (see
CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Lithium Concomitant administration of carbamazepine and lithium may increase the risk of neurotoxic side effects. Thyroid Effects with Other Anticonvulsant Medications Alterations
of thyroid function have been reported in combination therapy with other anticonvulsant medications. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Chloroquine and Mefloquine Anti-malarial drugs, such as 
chloroquine and mefloquine, may antagonize the activity of carbamazepine. Thus if a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on one of the agents in this category, and then begins a course of 
treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules, it is reasonable to expect that a dose adjustment may be necessary. CNS Depressants The concomitant use of carbamazepine extended-release 
capsules and other CNS depressants can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, hypotension, and syncope. CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: CNS depressants include: alcohol, 
opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, sedative/hypnotics, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, antihistamines, anticholinergics, alpha and beta blockers, general anesthetics, 
muscle relaxants, and illicit CNS depressants. Consider reducing the dose of CNS depressants or carbamazepine extended-release capsules when using these drugs concomitantly. Because of its primary CNS
effect, caution should be used when carbamazepine extended-release capsules are taken with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Resistance to the neuromuscular 
blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents pancuronium, vecuronium, rocuronium and cisatracurium has occurred in patients chronically administered carbamazepine. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: drug_interactions: Whether or not carbamazepine has the same effect on other nondepolarizing agents is unknown. Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from 
neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher.

CONTENT: CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide and they should be instructed to read the Medication 
Guide before taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. Patients should be made aware of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic 
reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of 
liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Patients should be advised that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, they must report any occurrence immediately to
their physicians. In addition, the patient should be advised that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use. CARBAMAZEPINE: 
information_for_patients: Patients should be advised that serious skin reactions have been reported in association with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In the event a skin reaction should 
occur while taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules, patients should consult with their physician immediately (see WARNINGS ). Patients should be advised that anaphylactic reactions and 
angioedema may occur during treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules (see WARNINGS ). Advise patients to immediately report signs and symptoms suggesting angioedema (swelling of the 
face, eyes, lips, or tongue, or difficulty in swallowing or breathing) and to stop taking the drug until they have consulted with their healthcare provider. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: 
Patients, their caregivers, and families should be counseled that AEDs, including carbamazepine, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert 
for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern 
should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use 
of any other prescription or nonprescription medications or herbal products. Caution should be exercised if alcohol is taken in combination with carbamazepine therapy, due to a possible additive 
sedative effect. Since dizziness and drowsiness may occur, patients should be cautioned about the hazards of operating machinery or automobiles or engaging in other potentially dangerous tasks. 
CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: Patients should be encouraged to enroll in the NAAED Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of 
antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. To enroll, patients can call the toll-free number 1-888-233-2334 (see Warnings-Usage in Pregnancy ). If necessary, the carbamazepine extended-release capsules can
be opened and the contents sprinkled over food, such as a teaspoon of applesauce or other similar food products. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules or their contents should not be crushed or 
chewed. Carbamazepine extended-release capsules may interact with some drugs. Therefore, patients should be advised to report to their doctors the use of any other prescription or non-prescription 
medication or herbal products. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed of the availability of a Medication Guide, and they should be instructed to read the Medication Guide prior 
to taking carbamazepine extended-release capsules. CARBAMAZEPINE: information_for_patients: See FDA approved Medication Guide.

        Question: Does CARBAMAZEPINE increase or decrease the risk of hospitalization?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether CARBAMAZEPINE increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that the information provided does not directly address the risk of hospitalization due to CARBAMAZEPINE use. However, it mentions several warnings and adverse effects 
associated with CARBAMAZEPINE, such as an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior, hyponatremia, serious skin reactions, and other allergic reactions that may affect organs and blood cells. 
These adverse effects could potentially lead to hospitalization, but the extracts do not quantify the risk of hospitalization or provide specific data on hospitalization rates.
        -----
        Final answer: The FDA label for CARBAMAZEPINE does not directly address the risk of hospitalization. While there are several warnings and adverse effects associated with its use that could 
potentially lead to hospitalization, there is no specific data provided on the risk of hospitalization. Therefore, it cannot be conclusively stated whether CARBAMAZEPINE increases or decreases the 
risk of hospitalization based on the available FDA label information.

The FDA label for CARBAMAZEPINE does not directly address the risk of hospitalization. While there are several warnings and adverse effects associated with its use that could potentially lead to 
hospitalization, such as an increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior, hyponatremia, serious skin reactions, and other allergic reactions that may affect organs and blood cells, there is no 
specific data provided on the risk of hospitalization. Therefore, it cannot be conclusively stated whether CARBAMAZEPINE increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization based on the available FDA 
label information.
