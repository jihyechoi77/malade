[31mDyskinesia A syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome [0m
[31mappears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment, which patients are likely[0m
[31mto develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. Both the risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it[0m
[31mwill become irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can [0m
[31mdevelop, although much less commonly, after relatively brief treatment periods at low doses. HALOPERIDOL: warnings: There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although [0m
[31mthe syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic treatment, itself, however, may suppress [0m[1;31m([0m[31mor partially suppress[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m the signs and symptoms of the [0m

[31mantipsychotic drugs should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who[0m

[31mThe need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on antipsychotics, drug discontinuation should be considered. [0m

[31mdrug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been [0m
[31mreported. Hyperpyrexia and heat stroke, not associated with the above symptom complex, have also been reported with haloperidol. Falls Haloperidol tablets, USP may cause somnolence, postural [0m
[31mhypotension, motor and sensory instability, which may lead to falls and, consequently, fractures or other injuries. HALOPERIDOL: warnings: For patients with diseases, conditions, or medications that [0m

[31mNonteratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been [0m

[31mhave been self-limited, in other cases neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Haloperidol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit [0m
[31mjustifies the potential risk to the fetus. HALOPERIDOL: warnings: Rodents given [0m[1;31m2[0m[31m to [0m[1;31m20[0m[31m times the usual maximum human dose of haloperidol by oral or parenteral routes showed an increase in incidence [0m
[31mof resorption, reduced fertility, delayed delivery and pup mortality. No teratogenic effect has been reported in rats, rabbits or dogs at dosages within this range, but cleft palate has been observed [0m
[31min mice given [0m[1;31m15[0m[31m times the usual maximum human dose. Cleft palate in mice appears to be a nonspecific response to stress or nutritional imbalance as well as to a variety of drugs, and there is no [0m
[31mevidence to relate this phenomenon to predictable human risk for most of these agents. There are no well controlled studies with haloperidol in pregnant women. There are reports, however, of cases of [0m
[31mlimb malformations observed following maternal use of haloperidol along with other drugs which have suspected teratogenic potential during the first trimester of pregnancy. Causal relationships were [0m
[31mnot established in these cases. HALOPERIDOL: warnings: Since such experience does not exclude the possibility of fetal damage due to haloperidol, this drug should be used during pregnancy or in women [0m

[31mlevels were decreased by a mean of [0m[1;31m70[0m[31m% and mean scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale were increased from baseline. In five other schizophrenic patients treated with haloperidol and rifampin, [0m
[31mdiscontinuation of rifampin produced a mean [0m[1;31m3.3[0m[31m-fold increase in haloperidol concentrations. Thus, careful monitoring of clinical status is warranted when rifampin is administered or discontinued in [0m

[31mstatistically significant differences in incidences of total tumors or specific tumor types were noted. Antipsychotic drugs elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic [0m
[31madministration. Tissue culture experiments indicate that approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these[0m

[31mreported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of [0m
[31mantipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date, however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; [0m

[31mthat persistent EPS have been reported; the drug may have to be discontinued in such cases. Dystonia Class Effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged abnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in [0m
[31msusceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to tightness of the throat, [0m

[31mreceiving short-term therapy experience no problems with abrupt discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs. However, some patients on maintenance treatment experience transient dyskinetic signs after [0m
[31mabrupt withdrawal. In certain of these cases the dyskinetic movements are indistinguishable from the syndrome described below under “Tardive Dyskinesia” except for duration. HALOPERIDOL: [0m

[31mavailable, it seems reasonable to gradually withdraw use of haloperidol. Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents, haloperidol has been associated with persistent dyskinesias. Tardive [0m
[31mdyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may appear in some patients on long-term therapy or may occur after drug therapy has been [0m
[31mdiscontinued. The risk appears to be greater in elderly patients on high dose therapy, especially females. The symptoms are persistent and in some patients appear irreversible. The syndrome is [0m
[31mcharacterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of tongue, face, mouth or jaw [0m[1;31m([0m[31me.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing movements[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m. Sometimes these may be [0m
[31maccompanied by involuntary movements of extremities and the trunk. HALOPERIDOL: adverse_reactions: There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia; antiparkinson agents usually do not [0m

[31mof the agent, or switch to a different antipsychotic agent, this syndrome may be masked. It has been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of tardive dyskinesia and[0m
