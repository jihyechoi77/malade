CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: warnings: WARNINGS Absorption of silver sulfadiazine varies depending upon the percent of body surface area and the extent of the tissue damage. Although few have been 
reported, it is possible that any adverse reaction associated with sulfonamides may occur. Some of the reactions which have been associated with sulfonamides are as follows: blood dyscrasias including
agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hemolytic anemia; dermatologic and allergic reactions, including life-threatening cutaneous reactions [Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and exfoliative dermatitis]; gastrointestinal reactions, hepatitis and hepatocellular necrosis; CNS reactions; and toxic nephrosis. There is a potential 
cross-sensitivity between silver sulfadiazine and other sulfonamides. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: warnings: If allergic reactions attributable to treatment with silver sulfadiazine occur, continuation of 
therapy must be weighed against the potential hazards of the particular allergic reaction. Fungal proliferation in and below the eschar may occur. However, the incidence of clinically reported fungal 
superinfection is low. The use of silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% in some cases of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-deficient individuals may be hazardous, as hemolysis may occur.         
SOURCE:SILVER SULFADIAZINE label


CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prompt institution of appropriate regimens for care of the burned patient is of prime importance and includes the 
control of shock and pain. The burn wounds are then cleansed and debrided; silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is then applied under sterile conditions. The burn areas should be covered with silver 
sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of approximately one sixteenth of an inch. Whenever necessary, the cream should be reapplied to 
any areas from which it has been removed by patient activity. Administration may be accomplished in minimal time because dressings are not required. However, if individual patient requirements make 
dressings necessary, they may be used. Reapply immediately after hydrotherapy. Treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should be continued until satisfactory healing has occurred or until the
burn site is ready for grafting. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: The drug should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except 
if a significant adverse reaction occurs.

CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: contraindications: CONTRAINDICATIONS Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to silver sulfadiazine or any of the other 
ingredients in the preparation. Because sulfonamide therapy is known to increase the possibility of kernicterus, silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should not be used on pregnant women approaching or 
at term, on premature infants, or on newborn infants during the first 2 months of life.

CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Several cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in patients receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy. 1,2,3 Leukopenia 
associated with silver sulfadiazine administration is primarily characterized by decreased neutrophil count. Maximal white blood cell depression occurs within two to four days of initiation of 
therapy. Rebound to normal leukocyte levels follows onset within two to three days. Recovery is not influenced by continuation of silver sulfadiazine therapy. An increased incidence has been seen in 
patients treated concurrently with cimetidine. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiforme, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial 
nephritis. Reduction in bacterial growth after application of topical antibacterial agents has been reported to permit spontaneous healing of deep partial-thickness burns by preventing conversion of 
the partial thickness to full thickness by sepsis. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: However, reduction in bacterial colonization has caused delayed separation, in some cases necessitating 
escharotomy in order to prevent contracture.

CONTENT: SILVER SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category B. A reproductive study has been performed in rabbits at doses up to three to ten times the concentration of
silver sulfadiazine in silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% and has revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to silver sulfadiazine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in 
pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly justified, especially in pregnant women 
approaching or at term. SILVER SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: (See CONTRAINDICATIONS )

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if SILVER SULFADIAZINE increases the risk of acute liver injury.
2. FDAHandler responded that the information provided does not specifically mention an increased risk of acute liver injury with the use of SILVER SULFADIAZINE. However, it does note that adverse 
reactions associated with sulfonamides, which include SILVER SULFADIAZINE, can involve hepatitis and hepatocellular necrosis, which are liver-related conditions. The label warns that any adverse 
reaction associated with sulfonamides may occur with the use of SILVER SULFADIAZINE.
        -----
        Final answer: SILVER SULFADIAZINE may be associated with liver-related conditions such as hepatitis and hepatocellular necrosis, which are indicative of liver injury. Therefore, it can be 
inferred that there is a potential risk of acute liver injury with the use of SILVER SULFADIAZINE, as these conditions are adverse reactions associated with sulfonamides, the drug class to which 
SILVER SULFADIAZINE belongs.

The final answer to the question "Does SILVER SULFADIAZINE increase or decrease the risk of acute liver injury?" is that SILVER SULFADIAZINE may be associated with liver-related conditions such as 
hepatitis and hepatocellular necrosis, which are indicative of liver injury. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is a potential risk of acute liver injury with the use of SILVER SULFADIAZINE, as 
these conditions are adverse reactions associated with sulfonamides, the drug class to which SILVER SULFADIAZINE belongs. This conclusion is based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which 
indicates that while the label does not specifically mention an increased risk of acute liver injury, it does warn that any adverse reaction associated with sulfonamides may occur with the use of 
SILVER SULFADIAZINE.
