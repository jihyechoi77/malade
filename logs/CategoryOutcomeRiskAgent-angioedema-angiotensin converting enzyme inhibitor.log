[34m                [0m[1;34m1[0m[34m. Drug LISINOPRIL: LISINOPRIL increases the risk of angioedema. This has been confirmed by FDAHandler, who referenced the LISINOPRIL label indicating that angioedema of the face, [0m
[34mextremities, lips, tongue, glottis, and/or larynx has been reported rarely in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, including LISINOPRIL. The incidence of angioedema is [0m
[34mhigher in Black patients compared to non-Black patients, and in very rare cases, fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema. Patients with a [0m
[34mhistory of angioedema unrelated to ACE-inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor. Intestinal angioedema has also been reported rarely in patients [0m
[34mtreated with ACE inhibitors.[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. Drug CAPTOPRIL: CAPTOPRIL increases the risk of angioedema. This has been reported in approximately one in [0m[1;34m1000[0m[34m patients, and can involve various parts of the body including extremities, face, [0m
[34mlips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis, or larynx. Fatal airway obstruction has occurred in some cases, and the risk is higher in black patients compared to non-black patients.[0m
