        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. From the provided list, the drugs that belong to the amphotericin b category are AMBISOME, ABELCET, and AMPHOTERICIN B.
2. The usage rates from the query are as follows: Ambisome (959), Amphotericin B (78), and Abelcet (amphotericin lipid complex) (1).
3. The drugs DIMYRISTOYLPHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE, DL- and DIMYRISTOYLPHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROL, DL- do not belong to the amphotericin b category and are not included in the representative list.
4. The most common drugs in the amphotericin b category, based on the usage rates provided, are AMBISOME, AMPHOTERICIN B, and ABELCET.
        -----
        Final answer: AMBISOME, AMPHOTERICIN B, ABELCET
