[31mSOURCE:THIOTHIXENE label[0m


[31mCONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: mechanism_of_action: ACTIONS Thiothixene is an antipsychotic of the thioxanthene series. Thiothixene possesses certain chemical and pharmacological similarities to the piperazine[0m
[31mphenothiazines and differences from the aliphatic group of phenothiazines.         [0m
[31mSOURCE:THIOTHIXENE label[0m


[31mCONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS An antiemetic effect was observed in animal studies with thiothixene; since this effect may also occur in man, it is possible that thiothixene may mask [0m
[31msigns of overdosage of toxic drugs and may obscure conditions such as intestinal obstruction and brain tumor. In consideration of the known capability of thiothixene and certain other psychotropic [0m
[31mdrugs to precipitate convulsions, extreme caution should be used in patients with a history of convulsive disorders or those in a state of alcohol withdrawal, since it may lower the convulsive [0m
[31mthreshold. Although thiothixene potentiates the actions of the barbiturates, the dosage of the anticonvulsant therapy should not be reduced when thiothixene is administered concurrently. Though [0m
[31mexhibiting rather weak anticholinergic properties, thiothixene should be used with caution in patients who might be exposed to extreme heat or who are receiving atropine or related drugs. THIOTHIXENE:[0m
[31mprecautions: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease. Caution as well as careful adjustment of the dosages is indicated when thiothixene is used in conjunction with other CNS [0m
[31mdepressants. Also, careful observation should be made for pigmentary retinopathy and lenticular pigmentation [0m[1;31m([0m[31mfine lenticular pigmentation has been noted in a small number of patients treated with [0m

[31mAntipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene [0m[1;31m3[0m[31m , elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Tissue culture experiments indicate that [0m
[31mapproximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously [0m
[31mdetected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown [0m
[31mfor most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date,[0m
[31mhowever, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. THIOTHIXENE:[0m
[31mprecautions: Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported [0m
[31mtemporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count [0m[1;31m([0m[31mWBC[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. [0m

[31mtherapy and discontinuation of thiothixene should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically [0m
[31msignificant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Patients with [0m

[31mexposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The [0m
[31mdecision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided. Drug [0m
[31mInteractions Hepatic microsomal enzyme inducing agents, such as carbamazepine, were found to significantly increase the clearance of thiothixene. Patients receiving these drugs should be observed for [0m

[31mCONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS NOTE : Not all of the following adverse reactions have been reported with thiothixene. However, since thiothixene has certain chemical and [0m
[31mpharmacologic similarities to the phenothiazines, all of the known side effects and toxicity associated with phenothiazine therapy should be borne in mind when thiothixene is used. Cardiovascular [0m
[31mEffects Tachycardia, hypotension, lightheadedness, and syncope. In the event hypotension occurs, epinephrine should not be used as a pressor agent since a paradoxical further lowering of blood [0m
[31mpressure may result. Nonspecific EKG changes have been observed in some patients receiving thiothixene. These changes are usually reversible and frequently disappear on continued thiothixene therapy. [0m
[31mThe incidence of these changes is lower than that observed with some phenothiazines. The clinical significance of these changes is not known. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: CNS Effects Drowsiness, [0m
[31musually mild, may occur although it usually subsides with continuation of thiothixene therapy. The incidence of sedation appears similar to that of the piperazine group of phenothiazines but less than[0m
[31mthat of certain aliphatic phenothiazines. Restlessness, agitation and insomnia have been noted with thiothixene. Seizures and paradoxical exacerbation of psychotic symptoms have occurred with [0m
[31mthiothixene infrequently. Hyperreflexia has been reported in infants delivered from mothers having received structurally related drugs. In addition, phenothiazine derivatives have been associated with[0m
[31mcerebral edema and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities. Extrapyramidal Symptoms Extrapyramidal symptoms, such as pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia and dystonia have been reported [0m[1;31m([0m[31msee Dystonia, Class effect[0m
[1;31m)[0m[31m. Management of these extra-pyramidal symptoms depends upon the type and severity. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Rapid relief of acute symptoms may require the use of an injectable antiparkinson [0m
[31magent. More slowly emerging symptoms may be managed by reducing the dosage of thiothixene and/or administering an oral antiparkinson agent. Dystonia Class effect Symptoms of dystonia, prolonged [0m
[31mabnormal contractions of muscle groups, may occur in susceptible individuals during the first few days of treatment. Dystonic symptoms include: spasm of the neck muscles, sometimes progressing to [0m
[31mtightness of the throat, swallowing difficulty, difficulty breathing, and/or protrusion of the tongue. While these symptoms can occur at low doses, they occur more frequently and with greater severity[0m
[31mwith high potency and at higher doses of first generation antipsychotic drugs. An elevated risk of acute dystonia is observed in males and younger age groups. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: [0m
[31mPersistent Tardive Dyskinesia As with all antipsychotic agents, tardive dyskinesia may appear in some patients on long-term therapy with thiothixene [0m[1;31m1[0m[31m or may occur after drug therapy has been [0m
[31mdiscontinued. The syndrome is characterized by rhythmical involuntary movements of the tongue, face, mouth or jaw [0m[1;31m([0m[31me.g., protrusion of tongue, puffing of cheeks, puckering of mouth, chewing [0m
[31mmovements[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m. Sometimes these may be accompanied by involuntary movements of extremities. Since early detection of tardive dyskinesia is important, patients should be monitored on an ongoing basis. It [0m
[31mhas been reported that fine vermicular movement of the tongue may be an early sign of the syndrome. If this or any other presentation of the syndrome is observed, the clinician should consider [0m
[31mpossible discontinuation of antipsychotic medication [0m[1;31m([0m[31msee WARNINGS section[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Hepatic Effects Elevations of serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase, usually [0m
[31mtransient, have been infrequently observed in some patients. No clinically confirmed cases of jaundice attributable to thiothixene have been reported. Hematologic Effects As is true with certain other[0m
[31mpsychotropic drugs, leukopenia and leukocytosis, which are usually transient, can occur occasionally with thiothixene. Other antipsychotic drugs have been associated with agranulocytosis, [0m
[31meosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. Allergic Reactions Rash, pruritus, urticaria, photosensitivity and rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with thiothixene. [0m
