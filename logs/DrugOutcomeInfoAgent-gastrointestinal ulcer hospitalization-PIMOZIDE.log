[31mMammary gland tumors in female mice were also increased, but these tumors are expected in rodents treated with antipsychotic drugs which elevate prolactin levels. Chronic administration of an [0m

[31mamenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported with antipsychotic drugs, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clinical studies[0m

[32mThe FDAHandler was unable to provide information on whether PIMOZIDE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, responding with DO-NOT-KNOW. This indicates that the FDA[0m
[32mlabel for PIMOZIDE does not contain information regarding its effect on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from the FDA label data whether [0m
