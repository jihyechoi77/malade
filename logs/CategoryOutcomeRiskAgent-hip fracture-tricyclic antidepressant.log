                Passages:
                1. Drug DOXEPIN HCL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDAHandler has indicated that the FDA label for DOXEPIN HCL does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, there is 
no known effect of DOXEPIN HCL on the risk of hip fracture, and I cannot provide a definitive answer to the question.
2. Drug DESIPRAMINE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for DESIPRAMINE does not specify any information about its effect on the risk of hip fracture. Therefore, it cannot be determined from this data whether DESIPRAMINE increases or 
decreases the risk of hip fracture.
3. Drug AMITRIPTYLINE HCL: The FDAHandler has responded with DO-NOT-KNOW to the question about whether AMITRIPTYLINE HCL increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture. This indicates that the FDA 
label for AMITRIPTYLINE HCL does not contain information regarding its impact on the risk of hip fracture. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, we cannot determine if there is an association 
between the use of AMITRIPTYLINE HCL and the risk of hip fracture.

 DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for AMITRIPTYLINE HCL does not specify whether the drug increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture, and therefore we do not have information to answer this question.

                Does the tricyclic antidepressant category of drugs increase the risk of
                hip fracture, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the tricyclic antidepressant category of drugs increase the risk of hip fracture, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passages provided do not contain specific information about the effect of tricyclic antidepressants on the risk of hip fracture.
2. For DOXEPIN HCL, DESIPRAMINE, and AMITRIPTYLINE HCL, the FDA labels do not specify whether these drugs increase or decrease the risk of hip fracture.
3. Without specific data or evidence from the FDA labels for these drugs, it is not possible to determine the effect of the tricyclic antidepressant category on the risk of hip fracture.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the tricyclic antidepressant category of drugs on the risk of hip fracture based on the information provided.
