CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: warnings: WARNINGS Hepatotoxicity There have been reports of hepatic dysfunction, including increased liver enzymes, and hepatocellular and/or cholestatic 
hepatitis, with or without jaundice, occurring in patients receiving oral erythromycin products. QT Prolongation Erythromycin has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval and infrequent 
cases of arrhythmia. Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving erythromycin. Fatalities have been reported. Erythromycin 
should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval, patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant 
bradycardia, and in patients receiving Class IA (quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (dofetilide, amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: warnings: Elderly patients 
may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Syphilis in Pregnancy There have been reports suggesting that erythromycin does not reach the fetus in adequate concentration to 
prevent congenital syphilis. Infants born to women treated during pregnancy with oral erythromycin for early syphilis should be treated with an appropriate penicillin regimen. Clostridium difficile 
Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Ery-Ped, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to 
fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development
of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: warnings: difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and
may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two 
months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and 
electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Drug Interactions Serious adverse reactions
have been reported in patients taking erythromycin concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates. These include colchicine toxicity with colchicine; rhabdomyolysis with simvastatin, lovastatin, and 
atorvastatin; and hypotension with calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent side effects of oral erythromycin preparations are gastrointestinal and are dose-related. They include 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and anorexia. Symptoms of hepatitis, hepatic dysfunction and/or abnormal liver function test results may occur. (See WARNINGS section.) Onset of 
pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibacterial treatment. (See WARNINGS .) Erythromycin has been associated with QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including 
ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes. (See WARNINGS .) Allergic reactions ranging from urticaria to anaphylaxis have occurred. Skin reactions ranging from mild eruptions to erythema 
multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported rarely. There have been reports of interstitial nephritis coincident with erythromycin use. ERYTHROMYCIN 
ETHYLSUCCINATE: adverse_reactions: There have been rare reports of pancreatitis and convulsions. There have been isolated reports of reversible hearing loss occurring chiefly in patients with renal 
insufficiency and in patients receiving high doses of erythromycin.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Orally administered erythromycin ethylsuccinate suspension is readily and reliably absorbed under both fasting and 
nonfasting conditions. Erythromycin diffuses readily into most body fluids. Only low concentrations are normally achieved in the spinal fluid, but passage of the drug across the blood-brain barrier 
increases in meningitis. In the presence of normal hepatic function, erythromycin is concentrated in the liver and excreted in the bile; the effect of hepatic dysfunction on excretion of erythromycin 
by the liver into the bile is not known. Less than 5 percent of the orally administered dose of erythromycin is excreted in active form in the urine. Erythromycin crosses the placental barrier, but 
fetal plasma levels are low. The drug is excreted in human milk. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: microbiology: Microbiology Mechanism of Action Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by 
binding 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible organisms. It does not affect nucleic acid synthesis. Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin and clindamycin, lincomycin, and 
chloramphenicol. Resistance Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone but are susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used concomitantly. Interactions With Other 
Antimicrobials Staphylococci resistant to erythromycin may emerge during a course of therapy. Antimicrobial Activity Erythromycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following 
microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: microbiology: Gram-positive Organisms: Corynebacterium 
diphtheriae Corynebacterium minutissimum Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus (resistant organisms may emerge during treatment) Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-negative 
Organisms: Bordetella pertussis Legionella pneumophila Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other Microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis Entamoeba histolytica Mycoplasma pneumoniae Treponema pallidum Ureaplasma 
urealyticum The following in vitro data are available. Erythromycin exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of 0.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: Hypotension, bradyarrhythmias, and lactic acidosis have been observed in patients receiving concurrent verapamil, belonging to the calcium 
channel blockers drug class. Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels. There have been reports of increased anticoagulant 
effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly. Increased anticoagulation effects due to interactions of erythromycin with various oral anticoagulants may be more pronounced
in the elderly. Erythromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of the 3A isoform subfamily of the cytochrome p450 enzyme system (CYP3A). ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: Coadministration of 
erythromycin and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both the therapeutic and adverse effects of the 
concomitant drug. Dosage adjustments may be considered, and when possible, serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving 
erythromycin. The following are examples of some clinically significant CYP3A based drug interactions. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A isoform are also possible. ERYTHROMYCIN 
ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: The following CYP3A based drug interactions have been observed with erythromycin products in post-marketing experience: Ergotamine/dihydroergotamine Post-marketing 
reports indicate that co-administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities 
and other tissues including the central nervous system. Concomitant administration of erythromycin with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS ). 
Triazolobenzodiazepines (such as triazolam and alprazolam) and Related Benzodiazepines Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the 
pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors Erythromycin has been reported to increase concentrations of HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors (e.g., lovastatin and simvastatin). Rare reports of rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients taking these drugs concomitantly. Sildenafil (Viagra) Erythromycin has been 
reported to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of sildenafil. Reduction of sildenafil dosage should be considered. (See Viagra package insert.) There have been spontaneous or published reports of 
CYP3A based interactions of erythromycin with cyclosporine, carbamazepine, tacrolimus, alfentanil, disopyramide, rifabutin, quinidine, methylprednisolone, cilostazol, vinblastine, and bromocriptine. 
ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: drug_interactions: Concomitant administration of erythromycin with cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, or terfenadine is contraindicated. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In 
addition, there have been reports of interactions of erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including hexobarbital, phenytoin, and valproate. Erythromycin has been reported to
significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating antihistamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including 
electrocardiographic QT/QT c interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other ventricular arrhythmias have been observed. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS .) In addition, deaths have been 
reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin.

CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: information_for_patients: Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Ery-Ped should only be used to treat bacterial 
infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Ery-Ped is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better 
early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate 
treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Ery-Ped or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by 
antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps 
and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: information_for_patients: If this occurs, patients should contact their 
physician as soon as possible.         
SOURCE:ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE label


CONTENT: ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: General Prescribing Ery-Ped in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to 
provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally excreted by the liver, caution should be exercised when 
erythromycin is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and WARNINGS sections.) Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of symptoms of 
myasthenic syndrome has been reported in patients receiving erythromycin therapy. There have been reports of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) occurring in infants following erythromycin 
therapy. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: In one cohort of 157 newborns who were given erythromycin for pertussis prophylaxis, seven neonates (5%) developed symptoms of non-bilious 
vomiting or irritability with feeding and were subsequently diagnosed as having IHPS requiring surgical pyloromyotomy . A possible dose-response effect was described with an absolute risk of IHPS of 
5.1% for infants who took erythromycin for 8-14 days and 10% for infants who took erythromycin for 15-21 days. 2 Since erythromycin may be used in the treatment of conditions in infants which are 
associated with significant mortality or morbidity (such as pertussis or neonatal Chlamydia trachomatis infections), the benefit of erythromycin therapy needs to be weighed against the potential risk 
of developing IHPS. Parents should be informed to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: general_precautions: Prolonged or repeated use 
of erythromycin may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria or fungi. If superinfection occurs, erythromycin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. When indicated, 
incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Observational studies in humans have reported cardiovascular malformations after exposure
to drug products containing erythromycin during early pregnancy. ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General Prescribing Ery-Ped in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected 
bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally 
excreted by the liver, caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and WARNINGS sections.) Exacerbation of
