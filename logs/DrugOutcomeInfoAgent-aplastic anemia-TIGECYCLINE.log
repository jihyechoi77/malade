rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, 2514
patients were treated with tigecycline for injection. Tigecycline for injection was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of patients compared to 6% for all comparators. Table 1 shows the 
incidence of adverse reactions through test of cure reported in ≥2% of patients in these trials. Table 1. TIGECYCLINE: adverse_reactions: Incidence (%) of Adverse Reactions Through Test of Cure

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: The adjusted risk difference for mortality stratified by trial weight was 0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2). The cause of this mortality difference has not been 
established. Generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, complications of infection or underlying co-morbidities. Tigecycline for injection should be reserved for use in situations when 
alternative treatments are not suitable  . 5.2 Mortality Imbalance and Lower Cure Rates in Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia A trial of patients with hospital acquired, including ventilator-associated, 
pneumonia failed to demonstrate the efficacy of tigecycline for injection. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: In this trial, patients were randomized to receive tigecycline for injection (100 mg 
initially, then 50 mg every 12 hours) or a comparator. In addition, patients were allowed to receive specified adjunctive therapies. The sub-group of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who 
received tigecycline for injection had lower cure rates (47.9% versus 70.1% for the clinically evaluable population). In this trial, greater mortality was seen in patients with ventilator-associated 
pneumonia who received tigecycline for injection (25/131 [19.1%] versus 15/122 [12.3%] in comparator-treated patients)  . Particularly high mortality was seen among tigecycline for injection-treated 
patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia at baseline (9/18 [50.0%] versus 1/13 [7. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 7%] in comparator-treated patients). 5.3 Anaphylactic 
Reactions Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including tigecycline for injection, and may be life-threatening. Tigecycline for injection is structurally 
similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and should be avoided in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. 5.4 Hepatic Adverse Effects Increases in 
total bilirubin concentration, prothrombin time and transaminases have been seen in patients treated with tigecycline. Isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure have been 
reported in patients being treated with tigecycline. Some of these patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Patients who develop abnormal liver 
function tests during tigecycline therapy should be monitored for evidence of worsening hepatic function and evaluated for risk/benefit of continuing tigecycline therapy. Hepatic dysfunction may occur
after the drug has been discontinued. 5.5 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis, including fatal cases, has occurred in association with tigecycline treatment. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be 
considered in patients taking tigecycline who develop clinical symptoms, signs, or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of acute pancreatitis. Cases have been reported in patients without known risk 
factors for pancreatitis. Patients usually improve after tigecycline discontinuation. Consideration should be given to the cessation of the treatment with tigecycline in cases suspected of having 
developed pancreatitis  . 5. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 6 Monitoring of Blood Coagulation Parameters Hypofibrinogenemia has been reported in patients treated with tigecycline for injection  .
Obtain baseline blood coagulation parameters, including fibrinogen, and continue to monitor regularly during treatment with tigecycline for injection. 5.7 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The
use of tigecycline for injection during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown). 
This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of tetracyclines, but it has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported.

association with bone marrow hypocellularity, have been seen with tigecycline at exposures of 8 times and 10 times the human daily dose based on AUC in rats and dogs, (AUC of approximately 50 and 60 
mcg·hr/mL at doses of 30 and 12 mg/kg/day) respectively. These alterations were shown to be reversible after two weeks of dosing.

The available information from the TIGECYCLINE label does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of aplastic anemia. The adverse reactions table and other sections list various 
adverse reactions and serious adverse reactions, but aplastic anemia is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to whether TIGECYCLINE increases or decreases the risk
of aplastic anemia.
