[32mBACTRIM may increase the risk of bleeding, especially in elderly patients taking certain diuretics and in patients on anticoagulant therapy such as warfarin. This information is based on the BACTRIM [0m
[32mlabel, which indicates an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura in elderly patients concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides. Additionally, BACTRIM may prolong the [0m
[32mprothrombin time in patients receiving warfarin, potentially leading to an increased risk of bleeding. It is recommended to monitor prothrombin time and INR in patients on anticoagulant therapy when [0m
[32mBACTRIM is administered.[0m
