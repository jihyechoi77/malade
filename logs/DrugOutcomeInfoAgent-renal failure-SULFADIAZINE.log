CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Prompt institution of appropriate regimens for care of the burned patient is of prime importance and includes the control of
shock and pain. The burn wounds are then cleansed and debrided; silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% is then applied under sterile conditions. The burn areas should be covered with silver sulfadiazine 
cream, USP 1% at all times. The cream should be applied once to twice daily to a thickness of approximately one sixteenth of an inch. Whenever necessary, the cream should be reapplied to any areas 
from which it has been removed by patient activity. Administration may be accomplished in minimal time because dressings are not required. However, if individual patient requirements make dressings 
necessary, they may be used. Reapply immediately after hydrotherapy. Treatment with silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should be continued until satisfactory healing has occurred or until the burn site
is ready for grafting. SULFADIAZINE: dosage_and_administration: The drug should not be withdrawn from the therapeutic regimen while there remains the possibility of infection except if a significant 
adverse reaction occurs.

CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General. If hepatic and renal functions become impaired and elimination of the drug decreases accumulation may occur. Discontinuation of silver 
sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% should be weighed against the therapeutic benefit being achieved. In considering the use of topical proteolytic enzymes in conjunction with Silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1%
the possibility should be noted that silver may inactivate such enzymes. Laboratory Tests. In the treatment of burn wounds involving extensive areas of the body, the serum sulfa concentrations may 
approach adult therapeutic levels (8 to 12mg %). Therefore, in these patients it would be advisable to monitor serum sulfa concentrations. Renal function should be carefully monitored and the urine 
should be checked for sulfa crystals. Absorption of the propylene glycol vehicle has been reported to affect serum osmolality, which may affect the interpretation of laboratory tests. Carcinogenesis, 
Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility. SULFADIAZINE: precautions: Long-term dermal toxicity studies of 24 months duration in rats and 18 months in mice with concentrations of silver sulfadiazine three 
to ten times the concentration in silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity.

CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Several cases of transient leukopenia have been reported in patients receiving silver sulfadiazine therapy. 1,2,3 Leukopenia associated with
silver sulfadiazine administration is primarily characterized by decreased neutrophil count. Maximal white blood cell depression occurs within two to four days of initiation of therapy. Rebound to 
normal leukocyte levels follows onset within two to three days. Recovery is not influenced by continuation of silver sulfadiazine therapy. An increased incidence has been seen in patients treated 
concurrently with cimetidine. Other infrequently occurring events include skin necrosis, erythema multiforme, skin discoloration, burning sensation, rashes, and interstitial nephritis. Reduction in 
bacterial growth after application of topical antibacterial agents has been reported to permit spontaneous healing of deep partial-thickness burns by preventing conversion of the partial thickness to 
full thickness by sepsis. SULFADIAZINE: adverse_reactions: However, reduction in bacterial colonization has caused delayed separation, in some cases necessitating escharotomy in order to prevent 
contracture.

CONTENT: SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: PREGNANCY: TERATOGENIC EFFECTS: Pregnancy Category B. A reproductive study has been performed in rabbits at doses up to three to ten times the concentration of silver
sulfadiazine in silver sulfadiazine cream, USP 1% and has revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to silver sulfadiazine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant 
women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly justified, especially in pregnant women approaching or
at term. SULFADIAZINE: pregnancy: (See CONTRAINDICATIONS )

ANSWER: SULFADIAZINE may increase the risk of renal failure. The label indicates that renal function should be carefully monitored and the urine should be checked for sulfa crystals, which implies 
that there is a concern for renal complications. Additionally, interstitial nephritis is listed as an infrequent adverse reaction, which is a condition that can lead to renal failure if severe and not
properly managed.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if SULFADIAZINE increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler responded that SULFADIAZINE may increase the risk of renal failure. The label indicates that renal function should be carefully monitored and the urine should be checked for sulfa 
crystals, which implies a concern for renal complications. Additionally, interstitial nephritis is listed as an infrequent adverse reaction, which can lead to renal failure if severe and not properly 
managed.

SULFADIAZINE may increase the risk of renal failure. This is based on the information from FDAHandler, which indicates that the label for SULFADIAZINE suggests that renal function should be carefully 
monitored and the urine should be checked for sulfa crystals. This implies that there is a concern for renal complications when using this drug. Additionally, interstitial nephritis is listed as an 
infrequent adverse reaction on the label, and this condition can lead to renal failure if it is severe and not properly managed.
