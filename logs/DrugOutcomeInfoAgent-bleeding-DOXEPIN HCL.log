[31memergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality. Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic[0m

[31mworsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. DOXEPIN HCL: warnings: Families and caregivers of [0m
[31mpatients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the [0m

[31mrisk for bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown. DOXEPIN HCL: warnings: However, prior to initiating treatment with an antidepressant, [0m
[31mpatients with depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family [0m
