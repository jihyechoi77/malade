                Passages:
                1. Drug LISINOPRIL: The FDA label for LISINOPRIL does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. The label lists various 
gastrointestinal issues, but there is no direct mention of gastrointestinal ulcers or their potential to lead to hospitalization.
2. Drug CAPTOPRIL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for CAPTOPRIL does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. While the label lists various gastrointestinal effects, 
including peptic ulcer, it does not provide a direct correlation with the risk of hospitalization due to gastrointestinal ulcers. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the effect 
of CAPTOPRIL on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization based on the FDA label data.
3. Drug ENALAPRIL MALEATE: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether ENALAPRIL MALEATE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. I requested information from FDAHandler to answer this question. However, I have 
not received any data that would allow me to determine the effect of ENALAPRIL MALEATE on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, without specific information from the FDA label
data, I cannot provide a reliable answer to this question.

                Does the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs increase the risk of
                gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The FDA label for LISINOPRIL does not specify any direct correlation with gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
2. The FDA label for CAPTOPRIL mentions gastrointestinal effects including peptic ulcer, but does not establish a direct correlation with hospitalization risk.
3. There is no available data from the FDA label for ENALAPRIL MALEATE that indicates its effect on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
4. Since there is no clear evidence from the FDA labels for these drugs indicating an increase or decrease in the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, it can be concluded that there is no 
clear effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category on this risk.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
