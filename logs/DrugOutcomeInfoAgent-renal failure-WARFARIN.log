CONTENT: WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy 
appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding. Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels 
achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs  . Instruct patients 
about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding  . 5.2 Tissue Necrosis Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues,
which is an uncommon but serious risk (<0.1%). WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin sodium 
therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported. Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine
whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin sodium 
therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.3 Calciphylaxis Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium uremic 
arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat calciphylaxis as 
appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy. 5. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 4 Acute Kidney Injury In patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of kidney disease, 
acute kidney injury may occur with warfarin sodium, possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria  . More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is advised in patients 
with compromised renal function. 5.5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli. Systemic 
atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization. The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by 
the pancreas, spleen, and liver. Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death. A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as “purple toes syndrome. WARFARIN: 
warnings_and_cautions: Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if such phenomena are observed. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary. 5.6 Limb Ischemia, Necrosis, 
and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS Do not use warfarin sodium as initial therapy in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with 
thrombosis syndrome (HITTS). Cases of limb ischemia, necrosis, and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or 
continued. In some patients, sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and/or death. Treatment with warfarin sodium may be considered after the platelet count has normalized. 5.7 Use in 
Pregnant Women with Mechanical Heart Valves Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: While warfarin sodium is contraindicated during
pregnancy, the potential benefits of using warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism. In those individual situations, the 
decision to initiate or continue warfarin sodium should be reviewed with the patient, taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient’s medical 
situation, as well as the most current medical guidelines. Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations (warfarin embryopathy and 
fetotoxicity), fatal fetal hemorrhage, and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this 
drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus  . 5. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: 8 Other Clinical Settings with Increased Risks In the following clinical settings, the 
risks of warfarin sodium therapy may be increased: Moderate to severe hepatic impairment Infectious diseases or disturbances of intestinal flora (e.g., sprue, antibiotic therapy) Use of an indwelling 
catheter Severe to moderate hypertension Deficiency in protein C-mediated anticoagulant response: Warfarin sodium reduces the synthesis of the naturally occurring anticoagulants, protein C and protein
S. Hereditary or acquired deficiencies of protein C or its cofactor, protein S, have been associated with tissue necrosis following warfarin administration. Concomitant anticoagulation therapy with 
heparin for 5 to 7 days during initiation of therapy with warfarin sodium may minimize the incidence of tissue necrosis in these patients. WARFARIN: warnings_and_cautions: Eye surgery: In cataract 
surgery, warfarin sodium use was associated with a significant increase in minor complications of sharp needle and local anesthesia block but not associated with potentially sight-threatening 
operative hemorrhagic complications. As warfarin sodium cessation or reduction may lead to serious thromboembolic complications, the decision to discontinue warfarin sodium before a relatively less 
invasive and complex eye surgery, such as lens surgery, should be based upon the risks of anticoagulant therapy weighed against the benefits. Polycythemia vera Vasculitis Diabetes mellitus 5.9 
Endogenous Factors Affecting INR The following factors may be responsible for increased INR response: diarrhea, hepatic disorders, poor nutritional state, steatorrhea, or vitamin K deficiency. The 
following factors may be responsible for decreased INR response: increased vitamin K intake or hereditary warfarin resistance.

studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin. Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin. 
7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals. Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for 
metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active 
ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves: Warfarin sodium may cause fetal harm; however, the benefits may outweigh the 
risks. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Monitor breastfeeding infants for bruising or bleeding. ( 8.2 ) Renal Impairment: Instruct patients with renal impairment to frequently monitor their INR. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 
Pregnancy Risk Summary Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves, who are at high risk of thromboembolism, and for whom the 
benefits of warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks  . Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm. Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in
about 5% of exposed offspring. WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: Because these data were not collected in adequate and well-controlled studies, this incidence of major birth defects is not an 
adequate basis for comparison to the estimated incidences in the control group or the U.S. general population and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice. Consider the benefits and risks 
of warfarin sodium and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing warfarin sodium to a pregnant woman. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of 
medications. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth 
defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions In humans, warfarin crosses the 
placenta, and concentrations in fetal plasma approach the maternal values. WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of 
congenital malformations in about 5% of exposed offspring. Warfarin embryopathy is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata) and growth 
retardation (including low birth weight). Central nervous system and eye abnormalities have also been reported, including dorsal midline dysplasia characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum, 
Dandy-Walker malformation, midline cerebellar atrophy, and ventral midline dysplasia characterized by optic atrophy. Mental retardation, blindness, schizencephaly, microcephaly, hydrocephalus, and 
other adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported following warfarin exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy  . 8.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: The developing hemostatic system in infants and children results in a changing physiology of thrombosis and response to anticoagulants. Dosing of 
warfarin in the pediatric population varies by patient age, with infants generally having the highest, and adolescents having the lowest milligram per kilogram dose requirements to maintain target 
INRs. Because of changing warfarin requirements due to age, concomitant medications, diet, and existing medical condition, target INR ranges may be difficult to achieve and maintain in pediatric 
patients, and more frequent INR determinations are recommended. Bleeding rates varied by patient population and clinical care center in pediatric observational studies and patient registries. Infants 
and children receiving vitamin K-supplemented nutrition, including infant formulas, may be resistant to warfarin therapy, while human milk-fed infants may be sensitive to warfarin therapy. 8. 
WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients receiving warfarin sodium in controlled clinical trials for which data were available for analysis, 1885 patients
(24.4%) were 65 years and older, while 185 patients (2.4%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but 
greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin  . Warfarin 
sodium is contraindicated in any unsupervised patient with senility. Conduct more frequent monitoring for bleeding with administration of warfarin sodium to elderly patients in any situation or with 
any physical condition where added risk of hemorrhage is present. WARFARIN: use_in_specific_populations: Consider lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin sodium in elderly patients  . 8.6 
Renal Impairment Renal clearance is considered to be a minor determinant of anticoagulant response to warfarin. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. Instruct patients 
with renal impairment taking warfarin to monitor their INR more frequently  . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment can potentiate the response to warfarin through impaired synthesis of clotting 
factors and decreased metabolism of warfarin. Conduct more frequent monitoring for bleeding when using warfarin sodium in these patients.

CONTENT: WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: Table 1: Three Ranges of Expected Maintenance Warfarin Sodium Tablets Daily Doses Based on CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Genotypes † VKORC1 CYP2C9 *1/*1 *1/*2 *1/*3 
*2/*2 *2/*3 *3/*3 GG 5 to 7 mg 5 to 7 mg 3 to 4 mg 3 to 4 mg 3 to 4 mg 0.5 to 2 mg AG 5 to 7 mg 3 to 4 mg 3 to 4 mg 3 to 4 mg 0.5 to 2 mg 0.5 to 2 mg AA 3 to 4 mg 3 to 4 mg 0.5 to 2 mg 0.5 to 2 mg 0.5
to 2 mg 0. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: 5 to 2 mg † Ranges are derived from multiple published clinical studies. VKORC1−1639G > A (rs9923231) variant is used in this table. Other co-inherited 
VKORC1 variants may also be important determinants of warfarin dose. 2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation Warfarin sodium tablets have a narrow therapeutic range (index), and their action
may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during warfarin sodium tablets therapy. Determine the INR daily after the 
administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of
performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: Perform additional INR tests 
when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium tablets, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug,
increases the INR  . Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of warfarin sodium tablets therapy. 2.5 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment 
is necessary for patients with renal failure. Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range . 2.6 Missed Dose The anticoagulant 
effect of warfarin sodium tablets persists beyond 24 hours. WARFARIN: dosage_and_administration: If a patient misses a dose of warfarin sodium tablets at the intended time of day, the patient should 
take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose. 2.7 Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery Some dental or surgical 
procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of warfarin sodium tablets therapy. Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing warfarin sodium tablets even for a short period
of time. Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately 
following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium tablets to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation. 2. WARFARIN: 
dosage_and_administration: 8 Conversion From Other Anticoagulants Heparin Since the full anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium tablets is not achieved for several days, heparin is preferred for 
initial rapid anticoagulation. During initial therapy with warfarin sodium tablets, the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance. Conversion to warfarin sodium 
tablets may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days. To ensure therapeutic anticoagulation, continue full dose heparin therapy and overlap warfarin sodium tablets 
therapy with heparin for 4 to 5 days and until warfarin sodium tablets has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by INR, at which point heparin may be discontinued.

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether WARFARIN increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler provided information from the WARFARIN label indicating that Warfarin can increase the risk of acute kidney injury, especially in patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a 
history of kidney disease. This is particularly associated with episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. Patients with compromised renal function are advised to monitor their INR more 
frequently.

        Final answer: Warfarin can increase the risk of acute kidney injury, which is a form of renal failure. This risk is particularly noted in patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a 
history of kidney disease, and during episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria. Therefore, patients with compromised renal function should monitor their INR levels more frequently to 
mitigate this risk.
