CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: While incorporated in bone matrix, alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress 
osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In
addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading to progressive gains in bone mass. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone 
hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process
is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone turnover. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is 
characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic 
fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis occurs in both males and females but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone 
turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes result in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 
50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to age 90, the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 
15- to 30-fold. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: It is estimated that approximately 40% of 50-year-old women will sustain one or more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or 
wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial morbidity, disability, and mortality. Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for
six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen 
degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the 
discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 
mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively,
to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease 
in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with 
alendronate sodium. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: In osteoporosis treatment studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific 
alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate 
sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal 
women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data 
indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady state, despite the progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: 
clinical_pharmacology: As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate 
sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate 
sodium 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. 
Similar reductions were observed with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The 
reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: drug_interactions: 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Calcium supplements, antacids or oral medications containing multivalent cations interfere with absorption of alendronate. ( 7.1 ) 
Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation. ( 7.2 , 7.3 ) 7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids Co-administration of BINOSTO 
and calcium, antacids, or oral medications containing multivalent cations will interfere with absorption of BINOSTO. Therefore, instruct patients to wait at least one-half hour after taking BINOSTO 
before taking any other oral medications. 7.2 Aspirin In clinical studies, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was increased in patients receiving concomitant therapy with daily 
doses of alendronate sodium greater than 10 mg and aspirin-containing products. 7. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: drug_interactions: 3 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) BINOSTO may be administered to
patients taking NSAIDs. In a 3-year, controlled, clinical study (n=2027) during which a majority of patients received concomitant NSAIDs, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events was 
similar in patients taking alendronate sodium 5 or 10 mg/day compared to those taking placebo. However, since NSAID use is associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be used during 
concomitant use with BINOSTO. 7.4 Levothyroxine The bioavailability of alendronate was slightly decreased when BINOSTO and levothyroxine were co-administered to healthy subjects  .

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new 
or worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper 
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects 
and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, 
dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and 
rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe 
and required hospitalization. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be 
instructed to discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences 
appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after 
developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot 
comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: There have been post-marketing 
reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials  . 5.2 Mineral Metabolism
Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with BINOSTO . Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with
these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with BINOSTO. Presumably due to the effects of BINOSTO on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic 
decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur. Patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. 5. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 3 Musculoskeletal Pain In 
post-marketing experience, severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain has been reported in patients taking bisphosphonates that are approved for the treatment of 
osteoporosis  . This category of drugs includes BINOSTO. Most of the patients were postmenopausal women. The time to onset of symptoms varied from one day to several months after starting the drug. 
Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. Most patients had relief of symptoms after stopping. A subset had recurrence of symptoms when rechallenged with the same drug or another bisphosphonate. In 
placebo-controlled clinical studies of alendronate sodium, the percentages of patients with these symptoms were similar in the alendronate sodium and placebo groups. 5.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Discontinue when pregnancy is recognized. ( 8.1 ) BINOSTO is not indicated for use in pediatric 
patients. ( 8.4 ) BINOSTO is not recommended in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min). ( 5.6 , 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data on the use of BINOSTO
in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk of adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Discontinue BINOSTO when pregnancy is recognized. In animal reproduction studies, daily oral 
administration of alendronate to rats from before mating through the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased postimplantation survival and decreased pup body weight gain starting at doses 
equivalent to less than half of the highest recommended 40 mg clinical daily dose (based on body surface area, mg/m 2 ). ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: Oral administration of 
alendronate to rats during organogenesis resulted in reduced fetal ossification starting at doses 3 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose. No similar fetal effects were observed in pregnant rabbits 
dosed orally during organogenesis at doses equivalent to approximately 10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose. Delayed or failed delivery of offspring, protracted parturition, and late pregnancy 
maternal and fetal deaths due to maternal hypocalcemia occurred in rats at oral doses as low as one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily dose (See Data ). Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone 
matrix, from which they are gradually released over a period of years. The amount of bisphosphonate incorporated into adult bone and available for release into the systemic circulation is directly 
related to the dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: Consequently, based on the mechanism of action of bisphosphonates, there is a potential risk of
fetal harm, predominantly skeletal, if a woman becomes pregnant after completing a course of bisphosphonate therapy. The impact of variables such as time between cessation of bisphosphonate therapy to
conception, the particular bisphosphonate used, and the route of administration (intravenous versus oral) on the risk has not been studied. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and 
miscarriage for the indicated population(s) is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated 
background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: Data Animal Data 
Reproduction studies in rats dosed orally from before mating to the end of gestation or lactation showed decreased postimplantation survival starting at 2 mg/kg/day and decreased body weight gain 
starting at 1 mg/kg/day, doses equivalent to less than half the 40 mg clinical daily dose based on body surface area, mg/m 2 . Incidence of incomplete fetal ossification in vertebral, skull, and 
sternebral bones were increased in rats dosed orally during organogenesis starting at 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 3 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). No similar fetal effects were observed in 
pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis at up to 35 mg/kg/day (equivalent to approximately 10 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose). ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: Both 
total and ionized calcium decreased in pregnant rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day alendronate (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) resulting in delays and failures of delivery. 
Protracted parturition due to maternal hypocalcemia was observed when rats were treated from before mating through gestation starting at 0.5 mg/kg/day (approximately one tenth the 40 mg clinical daily
dose). Maternotoxicity (late pregnancy deaths) also occurred in female rats treated orally with 15 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times the 40 mg clinical daily dose) for varying gestational time periods.
These maternal deaths were lessened but not eliminated by cessation of treatment. Calcium supplementation in the drinking water or by subcutaneous minipump to rats dosed orally with 15 mg/kg/day 
alendronate could not ameliorate the hypocalcemia or prevent the dystocia-related maternal and neonatal deaths. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: However, intravenous calcium 
supplementation prevented maternal, but not neonatal deaths. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether alendronate is present in human breast milk, affects human milk production, or has 
effects on the breastfed infant. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for BINOSTO and any potential adverse effects on the 
breastfed child from BINOSTO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use BINOSTO is not indicated for use in pediatric patients. The safety and efficacy of alendronate sodium were 
examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled two-year study of 139 pediatric patients, aged 4-18 years, with severe osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). ALENDRONATE SODIUM: 
use_in_specific_populations: One-hundred-and-nine patients were randomized to 5 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight less than 40 kg) or 10 mg alendronate sodium daily (weight greater than or equal to 
40 kg) and 30 patients to placebo. The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD Z-score of the patients was -4.5. The mean change in lumbar spine BMD Z-score from baseline to Month 24 was 1.3 in the 
alendronate-treated patients and 0.1 in the placebo- treated patients. Treatment with alendronate sodium did not reduce the risk of fracture. Sixteen percent of the alendronate-treated patients who 
sustained a radiologically-confirmed fracture by Month 12 of the study had delayed fracture healing (callus remodeling) or fracture non-union when assessed radiographically at Month 24 compared with 
9% of the placebo-treated patients. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: In alendronate-treated patients, bone histomorphometry data obtained at Month 24 demonstrated decreased bone 
turnover and delayed mineralization time; however, there were no mineralization defects. There were no statistically significant differences between the alendronate sodium and placebo groups in 
reduction of bone pain. The oral bioavailability in children was similar to that observed in adults. The overall safety profile of alendronate sodium in osteogenesis imperfecta patients treated for up
to 24 months was generally similar to that of adults with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium. However, there was an increased occurrence of vomiting in osteogenesis imperfecta patients 
treated with alendronate sodium compared to placebo. During the 24-month treatment period, vomiting was observed in 32 of 109 (29.4%) patients treated with alendronate sodium and 3 of 30 (10%) 
patients treated with placebo. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: In a pharmacokinetic study, 6 of 24 pediatric osteogenesis imperfecta patients who received a single oral dose of 
alendronate sodium 35 or 70 mg developed fever, flu-like symptoms, and/or mild lymphocytopenia within 24 to 48 hours after administration. These events, lasting no more than 2 to 3 days and responding
to acetaminophen, are consistent with an acute-phase response that has been reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates, including alendronate sodium. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] 8.5 Geriatric 
Use Of the patients receiving alendronate sodium in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT), 71% (n=2302) were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 17% (n=550) were greater than or equal to 75 
years of age. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: Of the patients receiving alendronate sodium in the United States and Multinational osteoporosis treatment studies in women and 
osteoporosis studies in men,  , 45% and 54%, respectively, were 65 years of age or over. No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but 
greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment BINOSTO is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min . No dosage adjustment is 
necessary in patients with creatinine clearance values between 35-60 mL/min  . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment As there is evidence that alendronate is not metabolized or excreted in the bile, no studies were 
conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: use_in_specific_populations: No dosage adjustment is necessary  .

reduction, p<0.001); in the Four-Year Study of FIT, the percentage was reduced from 3. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: 8% to 2.1% (44% relative risk reduction, p=0.001); and in the combined 
U.S./Multinational studies, from 6.2% to 3.2% (48% relative risk reduction, p=0.034). Alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of women experiencing multiple (two or more) new vertebral fractures 
from 4.2% to 0.6% (87% relative risk reduction, p<0.001) in the combined U.S./Multinational studies and from 4.9% to 0.5% (90% relative risk reduction, p<0.001) in the Three-Year Study of FIT. In the 
Four-Year Study of FIT, alendronate sodium reduced the percentage of osteoporotic women experiencing multiple vertebral fractures from 0.6% to 0.1% (78% relative risk reduction, p=0.035). ALENDRONATE 
SODIUM: clinical_studies: Thus, alendronate sodium reduced the incidence of radiographic vertebral fractures in osteoporotic women whether or not they had a previous radiographic vertebral fracture. 
Effect on Bone Mineral Density The bone mineral density efficacy of alendronate sodium 10 mg once daily in postmenopausal women, 44 to 84 years of age, with osteoporosis (lumbar spine bone mineral 
density [BMD] of at least 2 standard deviations below the premenopausal mean) was demonstrated in 4 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies of 2 or 3 years' duration. Figure 2 shows the mean
increases in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter in patients receiving alendronate sodium 10 mg/day relative to placebo-treated patients at three years for each of these studies. 
ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: Figure 2 Osteoporosis Treatment Studies in Postmenopausal Women Increase in BMD Alendronate Sodium 10 mg/day at Three Years At 3 years significant increases in 
BMD, relative both to baseline and placebo, were seen at each measurement site in each study in patients who received alendronate 10 mg/day. Total body BMD also increased significantly in each study, 
suggesting that the increases in bone mass of the spine and hip did not occur at the expense of other skeletal sites. Increases in BMD were evident as early as 3 months and continued throughout the 3 
years of treatment. ( See figures below for lumbar spine results.) In the 2-year extension of these studies, treatment of 147 patients with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day resulted in continued increases
in BMD at the lumbar spine and trochanter (absolute additional increases between years 3 and 5: lumbar spine, 0. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: 94%; trochanter, 0.88%). BMD at the femoral neck,
forearm and total body were maintained. Alendronate sodium was similarly effective regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover, and baseline BMD in the range studied (at least 2 standard 
deviations below the premenopausal mean). Figure 3 Osteoporosis Treatment in Studies in Postmenopausal Women Time Course Effect of Alendronate Sodium 10 mg/day Versus Placebo: Lumbar Spine BMD Percent
Change From Baseline In patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day for one or two years, the effects of treatment withdrawal were assessed. Following 
discontinuation, there were no further increases in bone mass and the rates of bone loss were similar to those of the placebo groups. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: Figure 2 Figure 3 Bone 
Histology Bone histology in 270 postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with alendronate sodium at doses ranging from 1 to 20 mg/day for one, two, or three years revealed normal 
mineralization and structure, as well as the expected decrease in bone turnover relative to placebo. These data, together with the normal bone histology and increased bone strength observed in rats 
and baboons exposed to long-term alendronate treatment, support the conclusion that bone formed during therapy with alendronate sodium is of normal quality. Effect on height Alendronate sodium, over a
three- or four-year period, was associated with statistically significant reductions in loss of height vs. placebo in patients with and without baseline radiographic vertebral fractures. At the end of
the FIT studies the between-treatment group differences were 3.2 mm in the Three-Year Study and 1.3 mm in the Four-Year Study. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: Weekly dosing The therapeutic 
equivalence of once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg (n=519) and alendronate sodium 10 mg daily (n=370) was demonstrated in a one-year, double-blind, multicenter study of postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis. In the primary analysis of completers, the mean increases from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at 1 year were 5.1% (4.8, 5.4%; 95% CI) in the 70 mg once-weekly group (n=440) and 5.4% (5.0, 
5.8%; 95% CI) in the 10 mg daily group (n=330). The 2 treatment groups were also similar with regard to BMD increases at other skeletal sites. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were 
consistent with the primary analysis of completers. 14. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_studies: 2 Treatment to Increase Bone Mass in Men with Osteoporosis The efficacy of alendronate sodium in men with 
hypogonadal or idiopathic osteoporosis was demonstrated in two clinical studies. Daily Dosing A two-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study of alendronate sodium 10 mg once daily 
enrolled a total of 241 men between the ages of 31 and 87 (mean, 63). All patients in the trial had either: 1) a BMD T-score less than or equal to -2 at the femoral neck and less than or equal to -1 
at the lumbar spine, or 2) a baseline osteoporotic fracture and a BMD T-score less than or equal to -1 at the femoral neck. At two years, the mean increases relative to placebo in BMD in men receiving
alendronate sodium 10 mg/day were significant at the following sites: lumbar spine, 5.

ANSWER: Alendronate Sodium is used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It works by binding to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibiting the activity of 
osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. This reduces bone resorption without directly affecting bone formation, although bone formation is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are 
coupled during bone turnover. Alendronate Sodium is continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces, leading to progressive gains in bone mass.

information regarding the risk of aplastic anemia. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this source whether Alendronate Sodium increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia. 

<DONE> DO-NOT-KNOW

The justification for this answer is that the FDA label for Alendronate Sodium, as provided by FDAHandler, does not contain information about the drug's effect on the risk of aplastic anemia. Without 
specific information from the FDA label, we cannot ascertain the relationship between Alendronate Sodium and the risk of aplastic anemia.
