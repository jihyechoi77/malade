[32mThe justification for this response is that the FDA label data, which is the source of information I have access to for this inquiry, does not contain details on the risk of hospitalization associated[0m
[32mwith the use of phenytoin. Consequently, I cannot determine whether phenytoin increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization based on the available data.[0m
