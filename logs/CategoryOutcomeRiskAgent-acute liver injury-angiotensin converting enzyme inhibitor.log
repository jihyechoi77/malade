                Passages:
                1. Drug LISINOPRIL: LISINOPRIL has been associated with a rare increase in the risk of acute liver injury, as indicated by rare cases of liver enzyme elevations and/or serum bilirubin 
elevations. This information is based on the LISINOPRIL label provided by FDAHandler.
2. Drug CAPTOPRIL: CAPTOPRIL, as an ACE inhibitor, can rarely increase the risk of a syndrome that may lead to acute liver injury, starting with cholestatic jaundice and potentially progressing to 
fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death. This information is based on the CAPTOPRIL label provided by the FDA, which states that this association is rare and the mechanism of the syndrome is 
not understood. Patients who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes while on CAPTOPRIL should discontinue the medication and receive appropriate medical follow-up.
3. Drug ENALAPRIL MALEATE: ENALAPRIL MALEATE has been associated with an increased risk of a syndrome that can lead to acute liver injury, including cholestatic jaundice and fulminant hepatic 
necrosis. However, the occurrence of this syndrome is rare.

                Does the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs increase the risk of
                acute liver injury, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs increase the risk of acute liver injury, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. All three drugs mentioned (LISINOPRIL, CAPTOPRIL, and ENALAPRIL MALEATE) are part of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor category.
2. Each drug has been associated with a rare increase in the risk of acute liver injury, as indicated by their respective FDA labels.
3. The evidence suggests that while the risk increase is rare, it is present for each of these drugs.
4. Given that all three drugs in the ACE inhibitor category listed here show a rare but increased risk of acute liver injury, it can be inferred that the category as a whole may have a similar effect.
        -----
        Final answer: The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor category of drugs increases the risk of acute liver injury, although this increase is rare.
