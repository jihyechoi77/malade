[31m        [0m[1;31m1[0m[31m. I asked FDAHandler if ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of aplastic anemia.[0m
[1;31m2[0m[31m. FDAHandler responded that the ABELCET label does not specifically mention aplastic anemia as a risk associated with its use. The label does list various hematologic issues such as anemia, [0m
[31mthrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, but aplastic anemia is not explicitly stated. The causal association between these adverse events and ABELCET is uncertain.[0m
[31m        -----[0m
[31m        Final answer: The risk of aplastic anemia associated with ABELCET is not specified in the FDA label, and therefore it is not known whether ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of aplastic [0m
