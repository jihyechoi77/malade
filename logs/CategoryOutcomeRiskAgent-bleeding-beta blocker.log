                Passages:
                1. Drug METOPROLOL TARTRATE: The answer to whether METOPROLOL TARTRATE increases or decreases the risk of bleeding is DO-NOT-KNOW. The reasoning behind this conclusion is that the FDA 
label for METOPROLOL TARTRATE does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of bleeding as an adverse reaction or precaution. While the label does mention hematologic adverse 
reactions such as agranulocytosis, nonthrombocytopenic purpura, and thrombocytopenic purpura, which can be associated with bleeding disorders, it does not explicitly state that METOPROLOL TARTRATE 
increases the risk of bleeding in general. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, we cannot definitively say whether METOPROLOL TARTRATE has an effect on the risk of bleeding.
2. Drug LABETALOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for LABETALOL does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of bleeding as an adverse reaction or side effect. Therefore, based on the FDA label data, it is not 
possible to determine whether LABETALOL has an effect on the risk of bleeding.
3. Drug ATENOLOL: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label for ATENOLOL does not contain information regarding its effect on bleeding risk. Therefore, it is not possible to determine from this source whether ATENOLOL increases or decreases the 
risk of bleeding.

                Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of
                bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the beta blocker category of drugs increase the risk of bleeding, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passages provided do not contain sufficient information to determine the effect of beta blockers on the risk of bleeding.
2. For METOPROLOL TARTRATE, the FDA label does not mention an increase or decrease in the risk of bleeding, although it does mention hematologic adverse reactions that can be associated with bleeding 
disorders.
3. For LABETALOL, the FDA label does not specify any effect on the risk of bleeding.
4. For ATENOLOL, the FDA label also does not contain information regarding its effect on bleeding risk.
5. Since the information from the FDA labels for these drugs is inconclusive, we cannot determine a clear effect of the beta blocker category on the risk of bleeding.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the beta blocker category on the risk of bleeding based on the information provided.
