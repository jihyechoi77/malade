CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: dosage_and_administration: 3 Important Administration Instructions Instruct patients to do the following to assure adequate drug absorption and to decrease the risk of 
esophageal adverse reactions: i. Take BINOSTO upon arising for the day and at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day. Patients should not swallow the undissolved 
effervescent tablet, should not chew the effervescent tablet or allow the effervescent tablet to dissolve in their mouths because of the risk for oropharyngeal irritation . Dissolve the effervescent 
tablet in 4 ounces room temperature plain water only (not mineral water or flavored water). ii. Wait at least 5 minutes after the effervescence stops and then stir the buffered solution for 
approximately 10 seconds and ingest. iii. Avoid lying down for at least 30 minutes after taking BINOSTO and until after their first food of the day. iv. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: dosage_and_administration: 
Do not take BINOSTO at bedtime or before arising for the day. Failure to follow these instructions may increase the risk of esophageal adverse reactions  . 2.4 Recommendations for Calcium and Vitamin 
D Supplementation Instruct patients to take supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate  . Patients at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency (e.g., over the age of 70 
years, nursing home-bound, or chronically ill) may need vitamin D supplementation. Patients with gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes may require higher doses of vitamin D supplementation and 
measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be considered. 2.5 Administration Instructions for Missed Doses If the once-weekly dose is missed, instruct patients to take one dose on the morning after 
they remember. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: dosage_and_administration: They should not take 2 doses on the same day but should return to taking one dose once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen 
day.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Animal studies have indicated the following mode of action. At the cellular level, alendronate 
shows preferential localization to sites of bone resorption, specifically under osteoclasts. The osteoclasts adhere normally to the bone surface but lack the ruffled border that is indicative of 
active resorption. Alendronate does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment or attachment, but it does inhibit osteoclast activity. Studies in mice on the localization of radioactive [ 3 
H]alendronate in bone showed about 10-fold higher uptake on osteoclast surfaces than on osteoblast surfaces. Bones examined 6 and 49 days after [ 3 H]alendronate administration in rats and mice, 
respectively, showed that normal bone was formed on top of the alendronate, which was incorporated inside the matrix. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: While incorporated in bone matrix, 
alendronate is not pharmacologically active. Thus, alendronate must be continuously administered to suppress osteoclasts on newly formed resorption surfaces. Histomorphometry in baboons and rats 
showed that alendronate treatment reduces bone turnover (i.e., the number of sites at which bone is remodeled). In addition, bone formation exceeds bone resorption at these remodeling sites, leading 
to progressive gains in bone mass. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that binds to bone hydroxyapatite and specifically inhibits the activity of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing 
cells. Alendronate reduces bone resorption with no direct effect on bone formation, although the latter process is ultimately reduced because bone resorption and formation are coupled during bone 
turnover. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass that leads to an increased risk of fracture. The diagnosis can 
be confirmed by the finding of low bone mass, evidence of fracture on x-ray, a history of osteoporotic fracture, or height loss or kyphosis, indicative of vertebral (spinal) fracture. Osteoporosis 
occurs in both males and females but is most common among women following the menopause, when bone turnover increases and the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of bone formation. These changes 
result in progressive bone loss and lead to osteoporosis in a significant proportion of women over age 50. Fractures, usually of the spine, hip, and wrist, are the common consequences. From age 50 to 
age 90, the risk of hip fracture in white women increases 50-fold and the risk of vertebral fracture 15- to 30-fold. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: It is estimated that approximately 40% 
of 50-year-old women will sustain one or more osteoporosis-related fractures of the spine, hip, or wrist during their remaining lifetimes. Hip fractures, in particular, are associated with substantial
morbidity, disability, and mortality. Daily oral doses of alendronate sodium (5, 20, and 40 mg for six weeks) in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent 
inhibition of bone resorption, including decreases in urinary calcium and urinary markers of bone collagen degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen). 
These biochemical changes tended to return toward baseline values as early as 3 weeks following the discontinuation of therapy with alendronate and did not differ from placebo after 7 months. 
ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Long-term treatment of osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day (for up to five years) reduced urinary excretion of markers of bone resorption, 
deoxypyridinoline and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type l collagen, by approximately 50% and 70%, respectively, to reach levels similar to those seen in healthy premenopausal women. Similar 
decreases were seen in patients in osteoporosis prevention studies who received alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. The decrease in the rate of bone resorption indicated by these markers was evident as early
as 1 month and at 3 to 6 months reached a plateau that was maintained for the entire duration of treatment with alendronate sodium. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: In osteoporosis treatment
studies alendronate sodium 10 mg/day decreased the markers of bone formation, osteocalcin and bone specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 50%, and total serum alkaline phosphatase by 
approximately 25 to 30% to reach a plateau after 6 to 12 months. In osteoporosis prevention studies alendronate sodium 5 mg/day decreased osteocalcin and total serum alkaline phosphatase by 
approximately 40% and 15%, respectively. Similar reductions in the rate of bone turnover were observed in postmenopausal women during one-year studies with once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg for the
treatment of osteoporosis and once weekly alendronate sodium 35 mg for the prevention of osteoporosis. These data indicate that the rate of bone turnover reached a new steady state, despite the 
progressive increase in the total amount of alendronate deposited within bone. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: As a result of inhibition of bone resorption, asymptomatic reductions in serum
calcium and phosphate concentrations were also observed following treatment with alendronate sodium. In the long-term studies, reductions from baseline in serum calcium (approximately 2%) and 
phosphate (approximately 4 to 6%) were evident the first month after the initiation of alendronate sodium 10 mg. No further decreases in serum calcium were observed for the five-year duration of 
treatment; however, serum phosphate returned toward prestudy levels during years three through five. Similar reductions were observed with alendronate sodium 5 mg/day. In one-year studies with once 
weekly alendronate sodium 35 and 70 mg, similar reductions were observed at 6 and 12 months. The reduction in serum phosphate may reflect not only the positive bone mineral balance due to alendronate 
sodium but also a decrease in renal phosphate reabsorption. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: Osteoporosis in Men Treatment of men with osteoporosis with alendronate sodium 10 mg/day for two 
years reduced urinary excretion of cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen by approximately 60% and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase by approximately 40%. Similar reductions were observed in 
a one-year study in men with osteoporosis receiving once weekly alendronate sodium 70 mg. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Relative to an intravenous (IV) reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability
of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardized breakfast. Oral bioavailability of the 10 mg tablet in
men (0.59%) was similar to that in women when administered after an overnight fast and 2 hours before breakfast. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: clinical_pharmacology: BINOSTO 70 mg effervescent tablet and 
alendronate sodium 70 mg tablet are bioequivalent. A study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of BINOSTO was performed in 119 healthy women. Bioavailability was decreased (by 
approximately 50%) when 70 mg alendronate sodium was administered 15 minutes before a standardized breakfast, when compared to dosing 4 hours before eating. In studies of treatment and prevention of 
osteoporosis, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before breakfast. Bioavailability was negligible whether alendronate sodium was administered with or up to 2 hours after a
standardized breakfast. Concomitant administration of alendronate with coffee or orange juice reduced bioavailability by approximately 60%.

CONTENT: ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions can occur. Instruct patients to follow dosing instructions. Discontinue if new 
or worsening symptoms occur. ( 5.1 ) Hypocalcemia can worsen and must be corrected prior to use. ( 5.2 ) Severe Bone, Joint, Muscle Pain may occur. Discontinue use if severe symptoms develop. ( 5.3 ) 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw has been reported. ( 5.4 ) Atypical Femur Fractures have been reported. Patients with new thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. ( 5.5 ) 
Sodium Content: Each tablet contains 603 mg sodium, equivalent to 1532 mg NaCl. Use caution in patients on sodium restriction. ( 5.7 ) 5. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 1 Upper 
Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions BINOSTO, like other bisphosphonates administered orally, may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. Because of these possible irritant effects 
and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when BINOSTO is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems (such as known Barrett's esophagus, 
dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, or ulcers). Esophageal adverse experiences, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal erosions, occasionally with bleeding and 
rarely followed by esophageal stricture or perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium. In some cases these have been severe 
and required hospitalization. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible esophageal reaction and patients should be 
instructed to discontinue BINOSTO and seek medical attention if they develop dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. The risk of severe esophageal adverse experiences 
appears to be greater in patients who lie down after taking oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium, and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates including alendronate sodium after 
developing symptoms suggestive of esophageal irritation. Therefore, it is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and understood by, the patient  . In patients who cannot 
comply with dosing instructions due to mental disability, therapy with BINOSTO should be used under appropriate supervision. ALENDRONATE SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: There have been post-marketing 
reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with complications, although no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials  . 5.2 Mineral Metabolism
Hypocalcemia must be corrected before initiating therapy with BINOSTO . Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency) should also be effectively treated. In patients with
these conditions, serum calcium and symptoms of hypocalcemia should be monitored during therapy with BINOSTO. Presumably due to the effects of BINOSTO on increasing bone mineral, small, asymptomatic 
decreases in serum calcium and phosphate may occur. Patients should receive adequate calcium and vitamin D intake. 5.
