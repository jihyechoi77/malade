[34mThe question asked was whether phenytoin sodium increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization. I initiated a query to FDAHandler to obtain information on the effects of phenytoin sodium on [0m
[34mhospitalization risk. However, I have not received any data or response from FDAHandler that would enable me to provide a substantiated answer. Therefore, without specific information from the FDA [0m

[34mThe justification for this response is that the FDA label data, which is the source of information I have access to for this inquiry, does not contain details on the risk of hospitalization associated[0m

[34mThe FDA label data does not specify information regarding the general risk of hospitalization associated with the use of extended phenytoin sodium. Hospitalization risk can be influenced by a variety [0m
