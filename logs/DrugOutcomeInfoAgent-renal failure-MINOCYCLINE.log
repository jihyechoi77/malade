        -----
        
CONTENT: MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: This adverse reaction is more common during long-term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short-term courses. Enamel hypoplasia has 
also been reported. TETRACYCLINE DRUGS, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT. C. All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone-forming tissue. A decrease in fibula 
growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg/kg every 6 hours. This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued. Results of
animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta, are found in fetal tissues, and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus. Evidence of embryotoxicity has 
been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy  5. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with nearly all 
antibacterial agents, including minocycline, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to 
overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as 
these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical 
history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed 
against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and 
surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Hepatotoxicity Post-marketing cases of serious liver injury, including irreversible drug-induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic 
failure (sometimes fatal) have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne. 5.4 Metabolic Effects The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. While this
is not a problem in those with normal renal function, in patients with significantly impaired function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and 
acidosis. If renal impairment exists, even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 
Under such conditions, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and if therapy is prolonged, serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Central 
nervous system side effects including light-headedness, dizziness or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy. Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving 
vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy. These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued. 5.6 Benign Intracranial 
Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri (benign intracranial hypertension) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines. Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate 
pseudotumor cerebri, the hallmark of which is papilledema. Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Bulging fontanels have been associated with 
the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may 
be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should
be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune 
Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like 
syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis.

CONTENT: MINOCYCLINE: overdosage: 10 OVERDOSAGE In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures. Minocycline is not removed in significant 
quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

CONTENT: MINOCYCLINE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a carcinogenicity study in which 
minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female rats once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 200 mg/kg/day, minocycline HCl was associated in both genders with follicular cell 
tumors of the thyroid gland, including increased incidences of adenomas, carcinomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in males, and adenomas and the combined incidence of adenomas 
and carcinomas in females. In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg/kg/day, exposure 
to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females. MINOCYCLINE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: Mutagenesis 
Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or CHO/HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. Minocycline was not 
clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral 
doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg/kg/day (which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline 
hydrochloride extended-release tablets). MINOCYCLINE: carcinogenesis_and_mutagenesis_and_impairment_of_fertility: However, oral administration of 100 or 300 mg/kg/day of minocycline to male rats 
(resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets) adversely 
affected spermatogenesis. Effects observed at 300 mg/kg/day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis, an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile, and (at 
100 and 300 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells. Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads, misshapen heads, and abnormal flagella. 
Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis. Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used by individuals of either gender 
who are attempting to conceive a child.

CONTENT: MINOCYCLINE: pregnancy: 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category D [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5.1 )] Minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets should not be used 
during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately. There are no adequate and 
well-controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women. Minocycline, like other tetracycline-class drugs, crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant 
woman. Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in post-marketing experience. Only limited information is 
available regarding these reports; therefore, no conclusion on causal association can be established. MINOCYCLINE: pregnancy: Minocycline induced skeletal malformations (bent limb bones) in fetuses 
when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day, respectively, (resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times, respectively, the systemic exposure to 
minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered
to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use minocycline hydrochloride 
extended-release tablets). MINOCYCLINE: pregnancy: Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri-and post-natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from 
day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation (postpartum day 20), at dosages of 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg/day. In this study, body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that 
received 50 mg/kg/day (resulting in approximately 2.5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets). No 
effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed. Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups (offspring of animals that received 
minocycline) included reduced body size, improperly rotated forelimbs, and reduced size of extremities. MINOCYCLINE: pregnancy: No effects were observed on the physical development, behavior, learning
ability, or reproduction of F1 pups, and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups (offspring of F1 animals).

ANSWER: Minocycline has been associated with reversible acute renal failure as a postmarketing adverse reaction. Additionally, the anti-anabolic action of tetracyclines, which includes minocycline, 
may cause an increase in BUN (blood urea nitrogen). In patients with significantly impaired renal function, higher serum levels of tetracycline-class drugs may lead to azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, and
acidosis, potentially increasing the risk of renal failure. Therefore, if renal impairment exists, lower than usual total doses are indicated, and serum level determinations of the drug may be 
advisable if therapy is prolonged.

        Question: Does MINOCYCLINE increase or decrease the risk of renal failure?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if MINOCYCLINE increases or decreases the risk of renal failure.
2. FDAHandler provided information from the Minocycline label indicating that minocycline has been associated with reversible acute renal failure as a postmarketing adverse reaction.
3. The label also notes that the anti-anabolic action of tetracyclines, which includes minocycline, may cause an increase in BUN, potentially increasing the risk of renal failure, especially in 
patients with significantly impaired renal function.
4. Lower than usual total doses are indicated for patients with renal impairment, and serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable if therapy is prolonged.
        -----
        Final answer: Minocycline has been associated with reversible acute renal failure as a postmarketing adverse reaction and may increase the risk of renal failure, especially in patients with 
significantly impaired renal function.
