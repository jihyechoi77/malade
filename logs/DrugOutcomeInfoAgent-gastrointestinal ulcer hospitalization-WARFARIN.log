studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin. Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin. 
7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals. Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for 
metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active 
ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g. 
WARFARIN: drug_interactions: garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant 
effects of warfarin sodium. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium (e.g., co-enzyme Q 10 , St. John’s wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with 
warfarin sodium through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John’s wort). The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium. Advise 
patients taking warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as 
eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables.

in 210 patients comparing two intensities of warfarin therapy (INR 2 to 2.25 vs. INR 2.5 to 4) for a three month period following tissue heart valve replacement, thromboembolism occurred with similar

patients in the higher intensity INR group compared to zero in the lower intensity INR group. 14.3 Myocardial Infarction WARIS (The Warfarin Re-Infarction Study) was a double-blind, randomized study 
of 1214 patients 2 to 4 weeks post-infarction treated with warfarin to a target INR of 2.8 to 4.8. The primary endpoint was a composite of total mortality and recurrent infarction. A secondary 
endpoint of cerebrovascular events was assessed. Mean follow-up of the patients was 37 months. The results for each endpoint separately, including an analysis of vascular death, are provided in Table

ANSWER: Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding, which includes the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a history of stomach or intestinal bleeding may have a higher risk of 
bleeding when taking warfarin. Therefore, it can be inferred that warfarin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization due to its bleeding risk, although the extracts do not

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler if WARFARIN increases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding, which includes the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a history of stomach or intestinal bleeding may have
a higher risk of bleeding when taking warfarin.
3. Although the FDA label does not provide specific data on hospitalization rates for gastrointestinal ulcers, it can be inferred that warfarin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer 
hospitalization due to its bleeding risk.

Warfarin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization due to its association with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. This inference is based on the information provided
by FDAHandler, which states that Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a history of stomach or intestinal bleeding may have a higher 
risk of bleeding when taking Warfarin. While the FDA label does not provide specific data on hospitalization rates for gastrointestinal ulcers, the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding suggests
a potential increase in the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal ulcers.
