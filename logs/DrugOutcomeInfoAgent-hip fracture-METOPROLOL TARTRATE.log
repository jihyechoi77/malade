CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Metoprolol tartrate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. They may be used alone or in 
combination with other antihypertensive agents. Angina Pectoris Metoprolol tartrate tablets, USP are indicated in the long-term treatment of angina pectoris. Myocardial Infarction Metoprolol tartrate 
tablets, USP are indicated in the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality when used alone or in 
conjunction with intravenous metoprolol. Oral metoprolol tartrate tablets, USP therapy can be initiated after intravenous metoprolol therapy or, alternatively, oral treatment can begin within 3 to 10 
days of the acute event (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and WARNINGS ).

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use Clinical trials of metoprolol in hypertension did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether patients over 65 
years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to metoprolol. Other reported clinical experience in elderly hypertensive patients has not identified any difference in response from 
younger patients. In worldwide clinical trials of metoprolol in myocardial infarction, where approximately 478 patients were over 65 years of age (0 over 75 years of age), no age-related differences 
in safety and effectiveness were found. Other reported clinical experience in myocardial infarction has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients. However, 
greater sensitivity of some elderly individuals taking metoprolol cannot be categorically ruled out. Therefore, in general, it is recommended that dosing proceed with caution in this population.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Hypertension and Angina Most adverse effects have been mild and transient. Central Nervous System: Tiredness and dizziness have 
occurred in about 10 of 100 patients. Depression has been reported in about 5 of 100 patients. Mental confusion and short-term memory loss have been reported. Headache, nightmares, and insomnia have 
also been reported. Cardiovascular: Shortness of breath and bradycardia have occurred in approximately 3 of 100 patients. Cold extremities; arterial insufficiency, usually of the Raynaud type; 
palpitations; congestive heart failure; peripheral edema; and hypotension have been reported in about 1 of 100 patients. Gangrene in patients with pre-existing severe peripheral circulatory disorders 
has also been reported very rarely. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS . METOPROLOL TARTRATE: adverse_reactions: ) Respiratory: Wheezing (bronchospasm) and dyspnea have been reported 
in about 1 of 100 patients (see WARNINGS ). Rhinitis has also been reported. Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea has occurred in about 5 of 100 patients. Nausea, dry mouth, gastric pain, constipation, 
flatulence, and heartburn have been reported in about 1 of 100 patients. Vomiting was a common occurrence. Postmarketing experience reveals very rare reports of hepatitis, jaundice and non-specific 
hepatic dysfunction. Isolated cases of transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactic dehydrogenase elevations have also been reported. Hypersensitive Reactions: Pruritus or rash have occurred in 
about 5 of 100 patients. Very rarely, photosensitivity and worsening of psoriasis has been reported. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: adverse_reactions: Miscellaneous: Peyronie’s disease has been reported in 
fewer than 1 of 100,000 patients. Musculoskeletal pain, blurred vision, and tinnitus have also been reported. There have been rare reports of reversible alopecia, agranulocytosis, and dry eyes. 
Discontinuation of the drug should be considered if any such reaction is not otherwise explicable. There have been very rare reports of weight gain, arthritis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis 
(relationship to metoprolol has not been definitely established). The oculomucocutaneous syndrome associated with the beta-blocker practolol has not been reported with metoprolol. Myocardial 
Infarction Central Nervous System: Tiredness has been reported in about 1 of 100 patients. Vertigo, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, headache, dizziness, visual disturbances, confusion, and reduced
libido have also been reported, but a drug relationship is not clear.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Known clinically significant potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 are antidepressants such as fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, bupropion, 
clomipramine, and desipramine; antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and thioridazine; antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propafenone; antiretrovirals such as ritonavir; 
antihistamines such as diphenhydramine; antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine or quinidine; antifungals such as terbinafine. Hydralazine: Concomitant administration of hydralazine may inhibit 
presystemic metabolism of metoprolol leading to increased concentrations of metoprolol. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Alpha-adrenergic Agents: Antihypertensive effect of alpha-adrenergic 
blockers such as guanethidine, betanidine, reserpine, alpha-methyldopa or clonidine may be potentiated by beta-blockers including metoprolol. Beta-adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the postural 
hypotensive effect of the first dose of prazosin, probably by preventing reflex tachycardia. On the contrary, beta adrenergic blockers may also potentiate the hypertensive response to withdrawal of 
clonidine in patients receiving concomitant clonidine and beta-adrenergic blocker. If a patient is treated with clonidine and metoprolol concurrently, and clonidine treatment is to be discontinued, 
stop metoprolol several days before clonidine is withdrawn. Rebound hypertension that can follow withdrawal of clonidine may be increased in patients receiving concurrent beta-blocker treatment. 
METOPROLOL TARTRATE: drug_interactions: Ergot Alkaloid: Concomitant administration with beta-blockers may enhance the vasoconstrictive action of ergot alkaloids. Dipyridamole: In general, 
administration of a beta-blocker should be withheld before dipyridamole testing, with careful monitoring of heart rate following the dipyridamole injection.

CONTENT: METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension Individualized the dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be taken 
with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily in single or divided doses, whether used alone or added to a diuretic. Increase the dosage 
at weekly (or longer) intervals until optimum blood pressure reduction is achieved. In general, the maximum effect of any given dosage level will be apparent after 1 week of therapy. The effective 
dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 to 450 mg per day. Dosages above 450 mg per day have not been studied. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: While once-daily dosing is 
effective and can maintain a reduction in blood pressure throughout the day, lower doses (especially 100 mg) may not maintain a full effect at the end of the 24-hour period, and larger or more 
frequent daily doses may be required. This can be evaluated by measuring blood pressure near the end of the dosing interval to determine whether satisfactory control is being maintained throughout the
day. Beta 1 selectivity diminishes as the dose of metoprolol is increased. Angina Pectoris The dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets should be individualized. Metoprolol tartrate tablets should be 
taken with or immediately following meals. The usual initial dosage of metoprolol tartrate tablets is 100 mg daily, given in two divided doses. Gradually increase the dosage at weekly intervals until 
optimum clinical response has been obtained or there is pronounced slowing of the heart rate. METOPROLOL TARTRATE: dosage_and_administration: The effective dosage range of metoprolol tartrate tablets 
is 100 to 400 mg per day. Dosages above 400 mg per day have not been studied. If treatment is to be discontinued, gradually decrease the dosage over a period of 1 to 2 weeks (see WARNINGS ). 
Myocardial Infarction Early Treatment During the early phase of definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, initiate treatment with metoprolol tartrate tablets as soon as possible after the 
patient's arrival in the hospital. Such treatment should be initiated in a coronary care or similar unit immediately after the patient’s hemodynamic condition has stabilized. Begin treatment in this 
early phase with the intravenous administration of three bolus injections of 5 mg of metoprolol tartrate each; give the injections at approximately 2-minute intervals. During the intravenous 
administration of metoprolol, monitor blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram.

response from FDAHandler regarding the effect of Metoprolol Tartrate on the risk of hip fracture. The FDAHandler indicated that the FDA label for Metoprolol Tartrate does not specify information about
the drug's effect on the risk of hip fracture. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine whether Metoprolol Tartrate increases or decreases the risk of hip fracture.
