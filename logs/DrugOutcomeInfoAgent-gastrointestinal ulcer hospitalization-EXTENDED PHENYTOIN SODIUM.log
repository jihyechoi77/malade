        -----
        
CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: geriatric_use: 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required .         
SOURCE:EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM label


CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: John’s wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, 
valproate sodium c , valproic acid c a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John’s wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic 
acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by 
phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy 
with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting
Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide 
Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance . Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, 
pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered 
phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Prevention or Management: Patients should be 
monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: Warfarin Increased and 
decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is co-administered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, 
rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate,
lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, 
nelfin EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: avir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active 
metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, 
verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of 
phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: drug_interactions: 3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate 
Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding 
preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding 
preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to 
measure serum phenytoin concentrations.

CONTENT: EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: 13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to 
phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), 
and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive 
deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases 
of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: warnings_and_cautions: A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting
factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 
5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug’s inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum 
Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as “delirium,” “psychosis,” or “encephalopathy,” or 
rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM: 
warnings_and_cautions: Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.

                Do one of the following:
                1. Search for relevant text using one of the following tools/functions:
                    `relevant_extracts`, `relevant_search_extracts`, and `drug_category_search`
                2. If you could not find an answer, state that you are done and DO-NOT-KNOW
                    as usual
                3. If you have found an answer, state that you are done and express the answer
                    as usual
                4. If you have no clear remaining question to answer, answer the original
                    question as in #3, and if there was no original question, respond
                    as in #2

                If you have been getting or sending repeated messages, always exit by
                stating that you are done (using the usual code) and say DO-NOT-KNOW.

                DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
                else to say, you are done and you MUST EXIT IMMEDIATELY by stating that you are done
                with the usual code (you MUST choose #2 or #3, and #4 specifies how to choose).
                THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. DO THIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE WAITING FOR ANY FURTHER MESSAGES.

        Do one of the following:

        1. If you intend to ask a question to FDAAgent:
            Please use the 'add_recipient' tool/function-call
            and specify FDAAgent as your `intended_recipient`.
            DO NOT REPEAT your original message; ONLY specify the 
            `intended_recipient` via this tool/function-call.
        2. If you are ready to have the critic check your answer,
            do so with the `final_answer` tool/function, as I have requested.
        3. If the critic is satisfied and you intend to submit your final answer,
            answer as I have requested, making sure to mark that you are done as usual.

        When you have decided and stated your answer (or lack of one), you must
        ALWAYS specify that you are done using the usual code.

        DO NOT simply acknowldedge these instructions. If you have nothing
        else to say, you MUST EXIT IMMEDIATELY by stating that you are done
        with the usual code (as in #3).

I sent a request to FDAHandler to inquire about the effects of EXTENDED PHENYTOIN SODIUM on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. However, I have not yet received a response from 
FDAHandler, and therefore cannot provide a reliable answer based on FDA label data.
