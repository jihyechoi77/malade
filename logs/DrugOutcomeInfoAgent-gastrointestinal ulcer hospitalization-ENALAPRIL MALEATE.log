CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: Heart Failure, Mortality Trials In a multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 2,569 patients with all degrees of symptomatic heart failure and 
ejection fraction ≤35 percent were randomized to placebo or enalapril and followed for up to 55 months (SOLVD-Treatment). Use of enalapril was associated with an 11 percent reduction in all-cause 
mortality and a 30 percent reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. Diseases that excluded patients from enrollment in the study included severe stable angina (>2 attacks/day), hemodynamically 
significant valvular or outflow tract obstruction, renal failure (creatinine >2.5 mg/dL), cerebrovascular disease (e.g., significant carotid artery disease), advanced pulmonary disease, malignancies, 
active myocarditis and constrictive pericarditis. The mortality benefit associated with enalapril does not appear to depend upon digitalis being present. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: A second 
multicenter trial used the SOLVD protocol for study of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients. SOLVD-Prevention patients, who had left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35 percent and no history 
of symptomatic heart failure, were randomized to placebo (n=2,117) or enalapril (n=2,111) and followed for up to 5 years. The majority of patients in the SOLVD-Prevention trial had a history of 
ischemic heart disease. A history of myocardial infarction was present in 80 percent of patients, current angina pectoris in 34 percent, and a history of hypertension in 37 percent. No statistically 
significant mortality effect was demonstrated in this population. Enalapril-treated subjects had 32 percent fewer first hospitalizations for heart failure, and 32 percent fewer total heart failure 
hospitalizations. ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: Compared to placebo, 32 percent fewer patients receiving enalapril developed symptoms of overt heart failure. Hospitalizations for cardiovascular
reasons were also reduced. There was an insignificant reduction in hospitalizations for any cause in the enalapril treatment group (for enalapril vs. placebo, respectively, 1166 vs. 1201 first 
hospitalizations, 2649 vs. 2840 total hospitalizations), although the study was not powered to look for such an effect. The SOLVD-Prevention trial was not designed to determine whether treatment of 
asymptomatic patients with low ejection fraction would be superior, with respect to preventing hospitalization, to closer follow-up and use of enalapril at the earliest sign of heart failure. 
ENALAPRIL MALEATE: pharmacodynamics: However, under the conditions of follow-up in the SOLVD-Prevention trial (every 4 months at the study clinic; personal physician as needed), 68 percent of patients
on placebo who were hospitalized for heart failure had no prior symptoms recorded which would have signaled initiation of treatment. The SOLVD-Prevention trial was also not designed to show whether 
enalapril modified the progression of underlying heart disease. In another multicenter, placebo-controlled trial (CONSENSUS) limited to patients with NYHA Class IV congestive heart failure and 
radiographic evidence of cardiomegaly, use of enalapril was associated with improved survival. The results are shown in the following table. SURVIVAL (%) Six Months One Year Enalapril Maleate (n=127) 
74 64 Placebo (n=126) 56 48 In both CONSENSUS and SOLVD-Treatment trials, patients were also usually receiving digitalis, diuretics or both.

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are
effective alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of enalapril maleate and thiazides are approximately 
additive. Heart Failure Enalapril maleate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of symptomatic congestive heart failure, usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. In these patients 
enalapril maleate improves symptoms, increases survival, and decreases the frequency of hospitalization (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of 
survival trials). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: Asymptomatic Left Ventricular Dysfunction In clinically stable asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 
≤35 percent), enalapril maleate tablets, USP decreases the rate of development of overt heart failure and decreases the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Heart
Failure, Mortality Trials for details and limitations of survival trials). In using enalapril maleate, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 
captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that enalapril maleate does not 
have a similar risk (see WARNINGS , Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis ). ENALAPRIL MALEATE: indications_and_usage: In considering use of enalapril maleate, it should be noted that in controlled clinical 
trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, it should be noted that black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been 
reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non-blacks (see WARNINGS, Head and Neck Angioedema ).

CONTENT: ENALAPRIL MALEATE: clinical_pharmacology: Heart rate was unchanged or slightly reduced, and mean ejection fraction was unchanged or increased. There was a beneficial effect on severity of 
heart failure as measured by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and on symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue. Hemodynamic effects were observed after the first dose and appeared to be 
maintained in uncontrolled studies lasting as long as four months. Effects on exercise tolerance, heart size, and severity and symptoms of heart failure were observed in placebo-controlled studies 
lasting from eight weeks to over one year. Heart Failure, Mortality Trials In a multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 2,569 patients with all degrees of symptomatic heart failure and

Clinical Pharmacology in Pediatric Patients A multiple dose pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 40 hypertensive male and female pediatric patients aged 2 months to ≤16 years following daily oral 
administration of 0.07 to 0.14 mg/kg enalapril maleate. At steady state, the mean effective half-life for accumulation of enalaprilat was 14 hours, and the mean urinary recovery of total enalapril and
enalaprilat in 24 hours was 68 percent of the administered dose. Conversion of enalapril to enalaprilat was in the range of 63 to 76 percent.

        Question: Does ENALAPRIL MALEATE increase or decrease the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I sent a query to FDAHandler to ask about the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization associated with ENALAPRIL MALEATE.
2. I have not received information from FDAHandler that would allow me to provide an informed answer.
3. Without specific information from the FDA label data, I cannot provide a reliable answer.
        -----
        Final answer: DO-NOT-KNOW

The question was whether ENALAPRIL MALEATE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. I requested information from FDAHandler to answer this question. However, I have 
not received any data that would allow me to determine the effect of ENALAPRIL MALEATE on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, without specific information from the FDA label
data, I cannot provide a reliable answer to this question.
