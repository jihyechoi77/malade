CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 6 ) Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia: The use of tigecycline for injection during tooth development (last half of pregnancy, infancy, and 
childhood to the age of 8 years) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth (yellow-gray-brown) and enamel hypoplasia. ( 5.7 ) Inhibition of Bone Growth: The use of tigecycline for injection 
during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, infancy, and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth. ( 5.8 ) Clostridium difficile associated Diarrhea 
(CDAD): evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.9 ) 5.1 All-Cause Mortality An increase in all-cause mortality has been observed in a meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical trials in tigecycline for 
injection-treated patients versus comparator-treated patients. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: In all 13 Phase 3 and 4 trials that included a comparator, death occurred in 4.0% (150/3788) of 
patients receiving tigecycline for injection and 3.0% (110/3646) of patients receiving comparator drugs. In a pooled analysis of these trials, based on a random effects model by trial weight, the 
adjusted risk difference of all-cause mortality was 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.2) between tigecycline for injection and comparator-treated patients. An analysis of mortality in all trials conducted for 
approved indications (cSSSI, cIAI, and CABP), including post-market trials showed an adjusted mortality rate of 2.5% (66/2640) for tigecycline and 1.8% (48/2628) for comparator, respectively. 
TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: The adjusted risk difference for mortality stratified by trial weight was 0.6% (95% CI 0.0, 1.2). The cause of this mortality difference has not been established. 
Generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, complications of infection or underlying co-morbidities. Tigecycline for injection should be reserved for use in situations when alternative 
treatments are not suitable  . 5.2 Mortality Imbalance and Lower Cure Rates in Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia A trial of patients with hospital acquired, including ventilator-associated, pneumonia failed
to demonstrate the efficacy of tigecycline for injection. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: In this trial, patients were randomized to receive tigecycline for injection (100 mg initially, then 50 mg
every 12 hours) or a comparator. In addition, patients were allowed to receive specified adjunctive therapies. The sub-group of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who received tigecycline 
for injection had lower cure rates (47.9% versus 70.1% for the clinically evaluable population). In this trial, greater mortality was seen in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who received
tigecycline for injection (25/131 [19.1%] versus 15/122 [12.3%] in comparator-treated patients)  . Particularly high mortality was seen among tigecycline for injection-treated patients with 
ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia at baseline (9/18 [50.0%] versus 1/13 [7. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 7%] in comparator-treated patients). 5.3 Anaphylactic Reactions 
Anaphylactic reactions have been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including tigecycline for injection, and may be life-threatening. Tigecycline for injection is structurally similar to 
tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and should be avoided in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs. 5.4 Hepatic Adverse Effects Increases in total bilirubin
concentration, prothrombin time and transaminases have been seen in patients treated with tigecycline. Isolated cases of significant hepatic dysfunction and hepatic failure have been reported in 
patients being treated with tigecycline. Some of these patients were receiving multiple concomitant medications.

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and 
electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibacterial drug treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.10 Sepsis/Septic Shock in 
Patients With Intestinal Perforation Monotherapy with tigecycline should be avoided in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) secondary to clinically apparent intestinal 
perforation. In cIAI studies (n=1642), 6 patients treated with tigecycline for injection and 2 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin presented with intestinal perforations and developed 
sepsis/septic shock. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: The 6 patients treated with tigecycline for injection had higher APACHE II scores (median = 13) versus the 2 patients treated with 
imipenem/cilastatin (APACHE II scores = 4 and 6). Due to differences in baseline APACHE II scores between treatment groups and small overall numbers, the relationship of this outcome to treatment 
cannot be established. 5.11 Tetracycline-Class Adverse Effects Tigecycline for injection is structurally similar to tetracycline-class antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse effects. Such 
effects may include: photosensitivity, pseudotumor cerebri, and anti-anabolic action (which has led to increased BUN, azotemia, acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia). 5. TIGECYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions:
12 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing tigecycline for injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and 
increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: information_for_patients: 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Tooth Discoloration and Inhibition of Bone Growth Advise pregnant women that tigecycline for injection may cause 
permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy . Lactation Advise a woman not to breastfeed 
for longer than 3 weeks while taking tigecycline for injection because of the lack of data on effects due to prolonged breastfeeding, and the theoretical risk of dental discoloration and inhibition of
bone growth. Women may also consider reducing infant exposure through pumping and discarding breastmilk during and for 9 days after the last dose of tigecycline . TIGECYCLINE: 
information_for_patients: Diarrhea Advise patients, their families, or caregivers that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs, including tigecycline for injection. Sometimes, 
frequent watery or bloody diarrhea may occur and may be a sign of a more serious intestinal infection. If severe watery or bloody diarrhea develops, advise patients to contact his or her healthcare 
provider . Development of Resistance Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including tigecycline for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat 
viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When tigecycline for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the 
course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. TIGECYCLINE: information_for_patients: Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the 
effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by tigecycline for injection or other antibacterial drugs in 
the future. Manufactured by: Manufactured for: Gland Pharma Limited, India. Apotex Corp. ML No. TIGECYCLINE: information_for_patients: 103/AP/RR/97/F/R Weston, Florida 33326 Revised: 03/2021

CONTENT: TIGECYCLINE: pharmacokinetics: Gender In a pooled analysis of 38 women and 298 men participating in clinical pharmacology studies, there was no significant difference in the mean (±SD) 
tigecycline clearance between women (20.7±6.5 L/h) and men (22.8±8.7 L/h). Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. Race In a pooled analysis of 73 Asian subjects, 53 Black 
subjects, 15 Hispanic subjects, 190 White subjects, and 3 subjects classified as “other” participating in clinical pharmacology studies, there was no significant difference in the mean (±SD) 
tigecycline clearance among the Asian subjects (28.8±8.8 L/h), Black subjects (23.0±7.8 L/h), Hispanic subjects (24.3±6.5 L/h), White subjects (22.1±8.9 L/h), and “other” subjects (25. TIGECYCLINE: 
pharmacokinetics: 0±4.8 L/h). Therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary based on race. Drug Interaction Studies Digoxin Tigecycline for injection (100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours) and 
digoxin (0.5 mg followed by 0.25 mg, orally, every 24 hours) were co-administered to healthy subjects in a drug interaction study. Tigecycline slightly decreased the C max of digoxin by 13%, but did 
not affect the AUC or clearance of digoxin. This small change in C max did not affect the steady-state pharmacodynamic effects of digoxin as measured by changes in ECG intervals. In addition, digoxin 
did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of tigecycline. Therefore, no dosage adjustment of either drug is necessary when tigecycline for injection is administered with digoxin. TIGECYCLINE: 
pharmacokinetics: Warfarin Concomitant administration of tigecycline for injection (100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours) and warfarin (25 mg single-dose) to healthy subjects resulted in a decrease
in clearance of R‑warfarin and S‑warfarin by 40% and 23%, an increase in C max by 38% and 43% and an increase in AUC by 68% and 29%, respectively. Tigecycline did not significantly alter the effects 
of warfarin on INR. In addition, warfarin did not affect the pharmacokinetic profile of tigecycline. However, prothrombin time or other suitable anticoagulation test should be monitored if tigecycline
is administered with warfarin. TIGECYCLINE: pharmacokinetics: In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tigecycline does not inhibit metabolism mediated by any of the following 6 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms: 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4. Therefore, tigecycline for injection is not expected to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by these enzymes. In addition, 
because tigecycline is not extensively metabolized, clearance of tigecycline is not expected to be affected by drugs that inhibit or induce the activity of these CYP450 isoforms. In vitro studies 
using Caco-2 cells indicate that tigecycline does not inhibit digoxin flux, suggesting that tigecycline is not a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor. TIGECYCLINE: pharmacokinetics: This in vitro 
information is consistent with the lack of effect of tigecycline on digoxin clearance noted in the in vivo drug interaction study described above. Tigecycline is a substrate of P-gp based on an in 
vitro study using a cell line overexpressing P-gp. The potential contribution of P-gp-mediated transport to the in vivo disposition of tigecycline is not known. Coadministration of P-gp inhibitors 
(e.g., ketoconazole or cyclosporine) or P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin) could affect the pharmacokinetics of tigecycline.

ANSWER: Tigecycline has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to comparator drugs in clinical trials. Specifically, in a meta-analysis of Phase 3 and 4 clinical 
trials, death occurred in 4.0% of patients receiving tigecycline and 3.0% of patients receiving comparator drugs. The adjusted risk difference of all-cause mortality was 0.6% between the two groups. 
In trials for approved indications, the adjusted mortality rate was 2.5% for tigecycline and 1.8% for comparator. Additionally, a trial of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, including 
ventilator-associated pneumonia, failed to demonstrate the efficacy of tigecycline, and greater mortality was seen in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia who received tigecycline (19.1% 
versus 12.3% in comparator-treated patients). The cause of the mortality difference has not been established, but generally, deaths were the result of worsening infection, complications of infection, 
or underlying comorbidities. Tigecycline should be reserved for use when alternative treatments are not suitable.

        Question: Does TIGECYCLINE increase or decrease the risk of hospitalization?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether TIGECYCLINE increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that TIGECYCLINE has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to comparator drugs in clinical trials, with a higher occurrence of death in 
patients receiving tigecycline. This information suggests that tigecycline may be associated with more severe outcomes, which could indirectly indicate an increased risk of hospitalization, although 
the direct correlation to hospitalization risk was not explicitly stated.
3. The increased mortality was often due to worsening infection, complications of infection, or underlying comorbidities, and tigecycline should be reserved for use when alternative treatments are not
suitable.
        -----
        Final answer: TIGECYCLINE has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in clinical trials, which may indirectly suggest an increased risk of hospitalization due to 
worsening infection, complications of infection, or underlying comorbidities. However, the FDA label data does not explicitly state the direct effect of tigecycline on hospitalization risk, so the 
degree of reliability regarding the increase in hospitalization risk cannot be fully determined from this information alone.

The final answer to the question "Does TIGECYCLINE increase or decrease the risk of hospitalization?" is that TIGECYCLINE has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in clinical 
trials, which may indirectly suggest an increased risk of hospitalization due to worsening infection, complications of infection, or underlying comorbidities. However, the FDA label data does not 
explicitly state the direct effect of tigecycline on hospitalization risk, so the degree of reliability regarding the increase in hospitalization risk cannot be fully determined from this information 
alone.
