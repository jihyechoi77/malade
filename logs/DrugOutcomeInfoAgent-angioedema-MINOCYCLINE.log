go away, or bloody stools. • Serious liver problems . Stop taking minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets and call your doctor right away if you get any of the following symptoms of liver 
problems: ∘ loss of appetite ∘ tiredness ∘ diarrhea ∘ yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes ∘ unexplained bleeding ∘ confusion ∘ sleepiness • Central nervous system effects. See “What

hydrochloride extended-release tablets and tell your doctor right away if you have blurred vision, vision loss, or unusual headaches. Immune system reactions including a lupus-like syndrome, 
hepatitis, and inflammation of blood or lymph vessels (vasculitis). Using minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets for a long time to treat acne may cause immune system reactions. Tell your

CONTENT: MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants. Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after 
discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent sequelae such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe exists. Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to 
initiation of treatment with tetracyclines. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, patients should be checked for papilledema. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided
because isotretinoin, a systemic retinoid, is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri. 5.7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes. The 
long-term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug-induced lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis and vasculitis. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Sporadic cases
of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use. Symptoms may be manifested by fever, rash, arthralgia, and malaise. In symptomatic patients, liver function tests, ANA, CBC, and other 
appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients. Use of all tetracycline-class drugs should be discontinued immediately. 5.8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an 
exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. This has been reported rarely with minocycline. Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or 
artificial sunlight (tanning beds or UVA/B treatment) while using minocycline. If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline, they should wear loose-fitting clothes that protect skin from 
sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician. 5. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 9 Serious Skin/Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis, serious skin 
reactions (e.g. Stevens Johnson syndrome), erythema multiforme, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients
with acne. DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction (such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis), eosinophilia, and one or more of the following visceral complications such as: hepatitis, 
pneumonitis, nephritis, myocarditis, and pericarditis. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. In some cases, death has been reported. If this syndrome is recognized, the drug should be discontinued
immediately. 5.10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in
many organs, including nails, bone, skin, eyes, thyroid, visceral tissue, oral cavity (teeth, mucosa, alveolar bone), sclerae and heart valves. Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur 
independently of time or amount of drug administration, whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration. Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as 
well as over sites of scars or injury. 5.11 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to the tetracyclines may develop in patients using minocycline hydrochloride extended-release 
tablets, therefore, the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy. Because of the potential for drug-resistant bacteria to develop 
during the use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets, it should be used only as indicated. 5. MINOCYCLINE: warnings_and_cautions: 12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic 
preparations, use of minocycline hydrochloride extended-release tablets may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, minocycline hydrochloride 
extended-release tablets should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. 5.13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems, including hematopoietic renal and 
hepatic studies should be performed. Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated.
