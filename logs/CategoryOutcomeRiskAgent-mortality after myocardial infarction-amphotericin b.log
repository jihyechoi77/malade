                Passages:
                1. Drug AMBISOME: DO-NOT-KNOW

The final answer to the question of whether AMBISOME increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction is DO-NOT-KNOW. This is because FDAHandler did not provide any information
that could answer this question, which could be due to a lack of specific data or studies on the subject within the FDA label data, or because the effect of AMBISOME on mortality after myocardial 
infarction is not a documented or known side effect or indication. Without specific information from FDA label data, it is not possible to provide a reliable answer.
2. Drug AMPHOTERICIN B: DO-NOT-KNOW

The FDA label data does not specify whether Amphotericin B increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction. Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable answer to this question 
based on the available data.
3. Drug ABELCET: The effect of ABELCET on the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction is not specified in the FDA label data, and the causal relationship between ABELCET and myocardial 
infarction is uncertain. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether ABELCET increases or decreases the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction based on the available information.

                Does the amphotericin b category of drugs increase the risk of
                mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        Question: Does the amphotericin b category of drugs increase the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passages provided do not contain specific information regarding the effect of the amphotericin b category of drugs on mortality after myocardial infarction.
2. For each of the drugs mentioned (AMBISOME, Amphotericin B, and ABELCET), the provided passages state 'DO-NOT-KNOW' as there is no specified information in the FDA label data.
3. Without specific data or studies, it is not possible to determine the effect of these drugs on mortality after myocardial infarction.
        -----
        Final answer: There is no clear effect of the amphotericin b category of drugs on the risk of mortality after myocardial infarction based on the information provided.
