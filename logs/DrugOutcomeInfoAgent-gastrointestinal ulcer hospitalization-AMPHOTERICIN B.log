CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS The total safety data base is composed of 921 patients treated with ABELCET ® (5 patients were enrolled twice and counted as separate 
patients), of whom 775 were treated with 5 mg/kg/day. Of these 775 patients, 194 patients were treated in four comparative studies; 25 were treated in open-label, non-comparative studies; and 556 
patients were treated in an open-label, emergency-use program. Most had underlying hematologic neoplasms, and many were receiving multiple concomitant medications. Of the 556 patients treated with 
ABELCET ® , 9% discontinued treatment due to adverse events regardless of presumed relationship to study drug. In general, the adverse events most commonly reported with ABELCET ® were transient 
chills and/or fever during infusion of the drug. AMPHOTERICIN B: adverse_reactions: Adverse Events a with an Incidence of ≥3% (N=556) Adverse Event Percentage (%) of Patients Chills 18 Fever 14

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: geriatric_use: Geriatric Use: Forty-nine elderly patients, age 65 years or over, have been treated with ABELCET ® at 5 mg/kg/day in two open-label studies and one small, 
prospective, single-arm study. No serious unexpected adverse events have been reported.

CONTENT: AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics The assay used to measure amphotericin B in the blood after the administration of ABELCET ® does not distinguish 
amphotericin B that is complexed with the phospholipids of ABELCET ® from amphotericin B that is uncomplexed. The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B after the administration of ABELCET ® are 
nonlinear. Volume of distribution and clearance from blood increase with increasing dose of ABELCET ® , resulting in less than proportional increases in blood concentrations of amphotericin B over a 
dose range of 0.6-5 mg/kg/day. AMPHOTERICIN B: clinical_pharmacology: The pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B in whole blood after the administration of ABELCET ® and amphotericin B desoxycholate are:

2. FDAHandler responded that Amphotericin B has been reported to cause gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 4% of patients, as listed in the adverse reactions table for the drug. However, there is no

The question was whether Amphotericin B increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Based on the information provided by FDAHandler, Amphotericin B has been reported to 
cause gastrointestinal hemorrhage in 4% of patients. However, there is no specific mention in the FDA label of an increased risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, while there is an
association with gastrointestinal hemorrhage, the specific risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal ulcers due to Amphotericin B is not detailed in the available FDA data.
