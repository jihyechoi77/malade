                1. Drug WARFARIN: Warfarin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization due to its association with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. This inference is
based on the information provided by FDAHandler, which states that Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with a history of stomach or 
intestinal bleeding may have a higher risk of bleeding when taking Warfarin. While the FDA label does not provide specific data on hospitalization rates for gastrointestinal ulcers, the increased risk
of gastrointestinal bleeding suggests a potential increase in the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal ulcers.
                ---------
                Does the warfarin category of drugs increase the risk of
                gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization, decrease it, or is there no clear effect?

        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. The passage provides information that Warfarin is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. The FDAHandler states that Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Patients with a history of stomach or intestinal bleeding are at a higher risk when taking Warfarin.
4. While there is no specific data on hospitalization rates for gastrointestinal ulcers, the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding implies a potential increase in the risk of hospitalization for
gastrointestinal ulcers.
