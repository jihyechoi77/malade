CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage of thiothixene capsules should be individually adjusted depending on the chronicity and severity of the symptoms of 
schizophrenia. In general, small doses should be used initially and gradually increased to the optimal effective level, based on patient response. Some patients have been successfully maintained on 
once-a-day thiothixene capsules therapy. The use of thiothixene capsules in children under 12 years of age is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established. In milder 
conditions, an initial dose of 2 mg three times daily is recommended. If indicated, a subsequent increase to 15 mg/day total daily dose is often effective. In more severe conditions, an initial dose 
of 5 mg twice daily is recommended. The usual optimal dose is 20 mg to 30 mg daily. If indicated, an increase to 60 mg/day total daily dose is often effective. THIOTHIXENE: dosage_and_administration: 
Exceeding a total daily dose of 60 mg rarely increases the beneficial response.

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Hepatic Effects Elevations of serum transaminase and alkaline phosphatase, usually transient, have been infrequently observed in some patients. No clinically 
confirmed cases of jaundice attributable to thiothixene have been reported. Hematologic Effects As is true with certain other psychotropic drugs, leukopenia and leukocytosis, which are usually 
transient, can occur occasionally with thiothixene. Other antipsychotic drugs have been associated with agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. Allergic 
Reactions Rash, pruritus, urticaria, photosensitivity and rare cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with thiothixene. Undue exposure to sunlight should be avoided. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: 
Although not experienced with thiothixene, exfoliative dermatitis and contact dermatitis (in nursing personnel) have been reported with certain phenothiazines. Endocrine/Reproductive 
Hyperprolactinemia 3 , lactation, menstrual irregularities, moderate breast enlargement and amenorrhea have occurred in a small percentage of females receiving thiothixene. If persistent, this may 
necessitate a reduction in dosage or the discontinuation of therapy. Phenothiazines have been associated with false positive pregnancy tests, gynecomastia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and glycosuria. 
Autonomic Effects Dry mouth, blurred vision, nasal congestion, constipation, increased sweating, increased salivation and impotence have occurred infrequently with thiothixene therapy. Phenothiazines 
have been associated with miosis, mydriasis, and adynamic ileus. THIOTHIXENE: adverse_reactions: Other Adverse Reactions Hyperpyrexia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in appetite and 
weight, weakness or fatigue, polydipsia, and peripheral edema. Although not reported with thiothixene, evidence indicates there is a relationship between phenothiazine therapy and the occurrence of a 
systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) Please refer to the text regarding NMS in the WARNINGS section. NOTE : Sudden deaths have occasionally been reported in
patients who have received certain phenothiazine derivatives. In some cases the cause of death was apparently cardiac arrest or asphyxia due to failure of the cough reflex. In others, the cause could

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS An antiemetic effect was observed in animal studies with thiothixene; since this effect may also occur in man, it is possible that thiothixene may mask 
signs of overdosage of toxic drugs and may obscure conditions such as intestinal obstruction and brain tumor. In consideration of the known capability of thiothixene and certain other psychotropic 
drugs to precipitate convulsions, extreme caution should be used in patients with a history of convulsive disorders or those in a state of alcohol withdrawal, since it may lower the convulsive 
threshold. Although thiothixene potentiates the actions of the barbiturates, the dosage of the anticonvulsant therapy should not be reduced when thiothixene is administered concurrently. Though 
exhibiting rather weak anticholinergic properties, thiothixene should be used with caution in patients who might be exposed to extreme heat or who are receiving atropine or related drugs. THIOTHIXENE:
precautions: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease. Caution as well as careful adjustment of the dosages is indicated when thiothixene is used in conjunction with other CNS 
depressants. Also, careful observation should be made for pigmentary retinopathy and lenticular pigmentation (fine lenticular pigmentation has been noted in a small number of patients treated with 
thiothixene for prolonged periods). Blood dyscrasias (agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura), and liver damage (jaundice, biliary stasis) have been reported with related drugs. 
Antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene 3 , elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Tissue culture experiments indicate that 
approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously 
detected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown 
for most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date,
however, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. THIOTHIXENE:
precautions: Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis Class Effect In clinical trial and/or postmarketing experience, events of leukopenia/neutropenia and agranulocytosis have been reported 
temporally related to antipsychotic agents. Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include preexisting low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia. 
Patients with a history of a clinically significant low WBC or drug induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of 
therapy and discontinuation of thiothixene should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically 
significant neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Patients with 
severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm 3 ) should discontinue thiothixene and have their WBC followed until recovery. Information for Patients Given the likelihood that some patients 
exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The 
decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided. Drug 
Interactions Hepatic microsomal enzyme inducing agents, such as carbamazepine, were found to significantly increase the clearance of thiothixene. Patients receiving these drugs should be observed for 
signs of reduced thiothixene effectiveness 4,5 . THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Due to a possible additive effect with hypotensive agents, patients receiving these drugs should be observed closely for 
signs of excessive hypotension when thiothixene is added to their drug regimen 6 .

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association 
with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene 2 . Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or 
blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify 
cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). 
Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. THIOTHIXENE: 
warnings: The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical 
monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens 
for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be 
carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Pregnancy Safe use of thiothixene during pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, this drug should be given to pregnant patients
only when, in the judgment of the physician, the expected benefits from the treatment exceed the possible risks to mother and fetus. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Non-teratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to 
antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, 
tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases 
neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Thiothixene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
Animal reproduction studies and clinical experience to date have not demonstrated any teratogenic effects. In the animal reproduction studies with thiothixene, there was some decrease in conception 
rate and litter size, and an increase in resorption rate in rats and rabbits. Similar findings have been reported with other psychotropic agents. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: After repeated oral 
administration of thiothixene to rats (5 to 15 mg/kg/day), rabbits (3 to 50 mg/kg/day), and monkeys (1 to 3 mg/kg/day) before and during gestation, no teratogenic effects were seen. Usage in Children 
The use of thiothixene in children under 12 years of age is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established. As is true with many CNS drugs, thiothixene may impair the 
mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, 
the patient should be cautioned accordingly. As in the case of other CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving thiothixene should be cautioned about the possible additive effects (which may include 
hypotension) with CNS depressants and with alcohol.

exposed chronically to antipsychotics will develop tardive dyskinesia, it is advised that all patients in whom chronic use is contemplated be given, if possible, full information about this risk. The 
decision to inform patients and/or their guardians must obviously take into account the clinical circumstances and the competency of the patient to understand the information provided. Drug 
Interactions Hepatic microsomal enzyme inducing agents, such as carbamazepine, were found to significantly increase the clearance of thiothixene. Patients receiving these drugs should be observed for 
signs of reduced thiothixene effectiveness 4,5 . THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Due to a possible additive effect with hypotensive agents, patients receiving these drugs should be observed closely for 
signs of excessive hypotension when thiothixene is added to their drug regimen 6 .

CONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association 
with antipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene 2 . Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or 
blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify 
cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). 
Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology. THIOTHIXENE: 
warnings: The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical 
monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens 
for uncomplicated NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be 
carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Pregnancy Safe use of thiothixene during pregnancy has not been established. Therefore, this drug should be given to pregnant patients
only when, in the judgment of the physician, the expected benefits from the treatment exceed the possible risks to mother and fetus. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: Non-teratogenic Effects Neonates exposed to 
antipsychotic drugs, during the third trimester of pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. There have been reports of agitation, hypertonia, hypotonia, 
tremor, somnolence, respiratory distress and feeding disorder in these neonates. These complications have varied in severity; while in some cases symptoms have been self-limited, in other cases 
neonates have required intensive care unit support and prolonged hospitalization. Thiothixene should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 
Animal reproduction studies and clinical experience to date have not demonstrated any teratogenic effects. In the animal reproduction studies with thiothixene, there was some decrease in conception 
rate and litter size, and an increase in resorption rate in rats and rabbits. Similar findings have been reported with other psychotropic agents. THIOTHIXENE: warnings: After repeated oral 
administration of thiothixene to rats (5 to 15 mg/kg/day), rabbits (3 to 50 mg/kg/day), and monkeys (1 to 3 mg/kg/day) before and during gestation, no teratogenic effects were seen. Usage in Children 
The use of thiothixene in children under 12 years of age is not recommended because safe conditions for its use have not been established. As is true with many CNS drugs, thiothixene may impair the 
mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery, especially during the first few days of therapy. Therefore, 
the patient should be cautioned accordingly. As in the case of other CNS-acting drugs, patients receiving thiothixene should be cautioned about the possible additive effects (which may include 
hypotension) with CNS depressants and with alcohol.

thiothixene on the risk of renal failure from the FDAHandler multiple times, but have not received any information. This suggests that the FDA label for thiothixene does not specify whether it 
increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question based on FDA label data. 

The lack of information in the FDA label could mean that there is no established effect, or that it has not been sufficiently studied or reported to warrant inclusion in the label. It is important to 
consult with a healthcare provider for the most personalized and up-to-date information regarding medication risks and benefits.
