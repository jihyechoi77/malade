[31mCONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS An antiemetic effect was observed in animal studies with thiothixene; since this effect may also occur in man, it is possible that thiothixene may mask [0m
[31msigns of overdosage of toxic drugs and may obscure conditions such as intestinal obstruction and brain tumor. In consideration of the known capability of thiothixene and certain other psychotropic [0m
[31mdrugs to precipitate convulsions, extreme caution should be used in patients with a history of convulsive disorders or those in a state of alcohol withdrawal, since it may lower the convulsive [0m
[31mthreshold. Although thiothixene potentiates the actions of the barbiturates, the dosage of the anticonvulsant therapy should not be reduced when thiothixene is administered concurrently. Though [0m
[31mexhibiting rather weak anticholinergic properties, thiothixene should be used with caution in patients who might be exposed to extreme heat or who are receiving atropine or related drugs. THIOTHIXENE:[0m
[31mprecautions: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease. Caution as well as careful adjustment of the dosages is indicated when thiothixene is used in conjunction with other CNS [0m

[31mAntipsychotic drugs, including thiothixene [0m[1;31m3[0m[31m , elevate prolactin levels; the elevation persists during chronic administration. THIOTHIXENE: precautions: Tissue culture experiments indicate that [0m
[31mapproximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent in vitro, a factor of potential importance if the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with a previously [0m
[31mdetected breast cancer. Although disturbances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and impotence have been reported, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown [0m
[31mfor most patients. An increase in mammary neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of antipsychotic drugs. Neither clinical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date,[0m
[31mhowever, have shown an association between chronic administration of these drugs and mammary tumorigenesis; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive at this time. THIOTHIXENE:[0m

[31mtherapy and discontinuation of thiothixene should be considered at the first sign of a clinically significant decline in WBC in the absence of other causative factors. Patients with clinically [0m

[31mCONTENT: THIOTHIXENE: precautions: PRECAUTIONS An antiemetic effect was observed in animal studies with thiothixene; since this effect may also occur in man, it is possible that thiothixene may mask [0m
[31msigns of overdosage of toxic drugs and may obscure conditions such as intestinal obstruction and brain tumor. In consideration of the known capability of thiothixene and certain other psychotropic [0m
[31mdrugs to precipitate convulsions, extreme caution should be used in patients with a history of convulsive disorders or those in a state of alcohol withdrawal, since it may lower the convulsive [0m
[31mthreshold. Although thiothixene potentiates the actions of the barbiturates, the dosage of the anticonvulsant therapy should not be reduced when thiothixene is administered concurrently. Though [0m

[32mThe lack of information in the FDA label could mean that there is no established effect, or that it has not been sufficiently studied or reported to warrant inclusion in the label. It is important to [0m
