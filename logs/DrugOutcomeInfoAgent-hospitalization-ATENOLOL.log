CONTENT: ATENOLOL: overdosage: OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with atenolol has been reported with patients surviving acute doses as high as 5 g. One death was reported in a man who may have taken as much as 
10 g acutely. The predominant symptoms reported following atenolol overdose are lethargy, disorder of respiratory drive, wheezing, sinus pause and bradycardia. Additionally, common effects associated 
with overdosage of any beta-adrenergic blocking agent and which might also be expected in atenolol overdose are congestive heart failure, hypotension, bronchospasm and/or hypoglycemia. Treatment of 
overdose should be directed to the removal of any unabsorbed drug by induced emesis, gastric lavage, or administration of activated charcoal. Atenolol can be removed from the general circulation by 
hemodialysis. ATENOLOL: overdosage: Other treatment modalities should be employed at the physician's discretion and may include: BRADYCARDIA: Atropine intravenously. If there is no response to vagal 
blockade, give isoproterenol cautiously. In refractory cases, a transvenous cardiac pacemaker may be indicated. HEART BLOCK (SECOND OR THIRD DEGREE): Isoproterenol or transvenous cardiac pacemaker. 
CARDIAC FAILURE: Digitalize the patient and administer a diuretic. Glucagon has been reported to be useful. HYPOTENSION: Vasopressors such as dopamine or norepinephrine (levarterenol). Monitor blood 
pressure continuously. BRONCHOSPASM: A beta 2 stimulant such as isoproterenol or terbutaline and/or aminophylline. HYPOGLYCEMIA: Intravenous glucose. ATENOLOL: overdosage: Based on the severity of 
symptoms, management may require intensive support care and facilities for applying cardiac and respiratory support.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: In a multicenter clinical trial (ISIS-1) conducted in 16,027 patients with suspected myocardial infarction, patients presenting within 12 hours (mean = 5 hours) 
after the onset of pain were randomized to either conventional therapy plus atenolol (n = 8,037), or conventional therapy alone (n = 7,990). Patients with a heart rate of < 50 bpm or systolic blood 
pressure < 100 mm Hg, or with other contraindications to beta blockade were excluded. Thirty-eight percent of each group were treated within 4 hours of onset of pain. The mean time from onset of pain 
to entry was 5.0 Â± 2.7 hours in both groups. ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: Patients in the atenolol group were to receive atenolol injection 5 to 10 mg given over 5 minutes plus atenolol tablets 50 mg 
every 12 hours orally on the first study day (the first oral dose administered about 15 minutes after the IV dose) followed by either atenolol tablets 100 mg once daily or atenolol tablets 50 mg twice
daily on days 2 to 7. The groups were similar in demographic and medical history characteristics and in electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial infarction, bundle branch block, and first degree 
atrioventricular block at entry. During the treatment period (days 0 to 7), the vascular mortality rates were 3.89% in the atenolol group (313 deaths) and 4.57% in the control group (365 deaths). This
absolute difference in rates, 0.68%, is statistically significant at the P< 0. ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: 05 level. The absolute difference translates into a proportional reduction of 15% 
(3.89-4.57/4.57 = -0.15). The 95% confidence limits are 1%-27%. Most of the difference was attributed to mortality in days 0 to 1 (atenolol - 121 deaths; control - 171 deaths). Despite the large size 
of the ISIS-1 trial, it is not possible to identify clearly subgroups of patients most likely or least likely to benefit from early treatment with atenolol. Good clinical judgment suggests, however, 
that patients who are dependent on sympathetic stimulation for maintenance of adequate cardiac output and blood pressure are not good candidates for beta blockade. Indeed, the trial protocol reflected
that judgment by excluding patients with blood pressure consistently below 100 mm Hg systolic. ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: The overall results of the study are compatible with the possibility that 
patients with borderline blood pressure (less than 120 mm Hg systolic), especially if over 60 years of age, are less likely to benefit. The mechanism through which atenolol improves survival in 
patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction is unknown, as is the case for other beta blockers in the postinfarction setting. Atenolol, in addition to its effects on survival, has 
shown other clinical benefits including reduced frequency of ventricular premature beats, reduced chest pain, and reduced enzyme elevation.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: Pharmacodynamics In standard animal or human pharmacological tests, beta-adrenoreceptor blocking activity of atenolol has been demonstrated by: (1) reduction in 
resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, (2) reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at rest and on exercise, (3) inhibition of isoproterenol induced tachycardia, and (4) 
reduction in reflex orthostatic tachycardia. A significant beta-blocking effect of atenolol, as measured by reduction of exercise tachycardia, is apparent within one hour following oral administration
of a single dose. This effect is maximal at about 2 to 4 hours, and persists for at least 24 hours. Maximum reduction in exercise tachycardia occurs within 5 minutes of an intravenous dose. ATENOLOL: 
pharmacodynamics: For both orally and intravenously administered drug, the duration of action is dose related and also bears a linear relationship to the logarithm of plasma atenolol concentration. 
The effect on exercise tachycardia of a single 10 mg intravenous dose is largely dissipated by 12 hours, whereas beta-blocking activity of single oral doses of 50 mg and 100 mg is still evident beyond
24 hours following administration. However, as has been shown for all beta-blocking agents, the antihypertensive effect does not appear to be related to plasma level. In normal subjects, the beta1 
selectivity of atenolol has been shown by its reduced ability to reverse the beta2-mediated vasodilating effect of isoproterenol as compared to equivalent betab-locking doses of propranolol. ATENOLOL:
pharmacodynamics: In asthmatic patients, a dose of atenolol producing a greater effect on resting heart rate than propranolol resulted in much less increase in airway resistance. In a placebo 
controlled comparison of approximately equipotent oral doses of several beta blockers, atenolol produced a significantly smaller decrease of FEV1 than nonselective beta blockers such as propranolol 
and, unlike those agents, did not inhibit bronchodilation in response to isoproterenol. Consistent with its negative chronotropic effect due to beta blockade of the SA node, atenolol increases sinus 
cycle length and sinus node recovery time. Conduction in the AV node is also prolonged. Atenolol is devoid of membrane stabilizing activity, and increasing the dose well beyond that producing beta 
blockade does not further depress myocardial contractility. Several studies have demonstrated a moderate (approximately 10%) increase in stroke volume at rest and during exercise. ATENOLOL: 
pharmacodynamics: In controlled clinical trials, atenolol, given as a single daily oral dose, was an effective antihypertensive agent providing 24-hour reduction of blood pressure. Atenolol has been 
studied in combination with thiazide-type diuretics, and the blood pressure effects of the combination are approximately additive. Atenolol is also compatible with methyldopa, hydralazine, and 
prazosin, each combination resulting in a larger fall in blood pressure than with the single agents. The dose range of atenolol is narrow and increasing the dose beyond 100 mg once daily is not 
associated with increased antihypertensive effect. The mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of beta-blocking agents have not been established. ATENOLOL: pharmacodynamics: Several possible 
mechanisms have been proposed and include: (1) competitive antagonism of catecholamines at peripheral (especially cardiac) adrenergic neuron sites, leading to decreased cardiac output, (2) a central 
effect leading to reduced sympathetic outflow to the periphery, and (3) suppression of renin activity. The results from long-term studies have not shown any diminution of the antihypertensive efficacy
of atenolol with prolonged use. By blocking the positive chronotropic and inotropic effects of catecholamines and by decreasing blood pressure, atenolol generally reduces the oxygen requirements of 
the heart at any given level of effort, making it useful for many patients in the long-term management of angina pectoris. On the other hand, atenolol can increase oxygen requirements by increasing 
left ventricular fiber length and end diastolic pressure, particularly in patients with heart failure.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: precautions: PRECAUTIONS General Patients already on a beta blocker must be evaluated carefully before atenolol is administered. Initial and subsequent atenolol dosages can be 
adjusted downward depending on clinical observations including pulse and blood pressure. Atenolol may aggravate peripheral arterial circulatory disorders. Impaired Renal Function The drug should be 
used with caution in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Drug Interactions Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given 
with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with atenolol plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce 
vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Calcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with atenolol (see WARNINGS ). ATENOLOL: precautions: Disopyramide is a Type I 
antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta blockers. 
Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta blockers. Beta blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension, which can 
follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta 
blocker therapy, the introduction of beta blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped. Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, e.g., 
indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta blockers. ATENOLOL: precautions: Information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited. Data from several studies, i.e., 
TIMI-II, ISIS-2, currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and beta blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting. While taking beta blockers, patients with a history of 
anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual 
doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction. Both digitalis glycosides and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of
bradycardia. ATENOLOL: precautions: Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two long-term (maximum dosing duration of 18 or 24 months) rat studies and one long-term (maximum dosing 
duration of 18 months) mouse study, each employing dose levels as high as 300 mg/kg/day or 150 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * , did not indicate a carcinogenic potential 
of atenolol. A third (24 month) rat study, employing doses of 500 and 1,500 mg/kg/day (250 and 750 times the maximum recommended human antihypertensive dose * ) resulted in increased incidences of 
benign adrenal medullary tumors in males and females, mammary fibroadenomas in females, and anterior pituitary adenomas and thyroid parafollicular cell carcinomas in males. ATENOLOL: precautions: No 
evidence of a mutagenic potential of atenolol was uncovered in the dominant lethal test (mouse), in vivo cytogenetics test (Chinese hamster) or Ames test (S. typhimurium). Fertility of male or female 
rats (evaluated at dose levels as high as 200 mg/kg/day or 100 times the maximum recommended human dose * ) was unaffected by atenolol administration. Animal Toxicology Chronic studies employing oral 
atenolol performed in animals have revealed the occurrence of vacuolation of epithelial cells of Brunner's glands in the duodenum of both male and female dogs at all tested dose levels of atenolol 
(starting at 15 mg/kg/day or 7.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Atenolol is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk 
of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of 
pharmacologic classes including atenolol. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, 
antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and 
management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood 
Pressure (JNC). ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized 
controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely
responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular 
mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so 
that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations
with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such 
patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients,
and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. 
Atenolol may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis Atenolol is indicated for the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris. 
ATENOLOL: indications_and_usage: Acute Myocardial Infarction Atenolol is indicated in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce
cardiovascular mortality. Treatment can be initiated as soon as the patient's clinical condition allows (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and WARNINGS ). In general, there is no 
basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the ISIS-1 trial (blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg systolic, heart rate less than 50 bpm) or have other reasons to avoid beta blockade. 
As noted above, some subgroups (e.g., elderly patients with systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg) seemed less likely to benefit.

CONTENT: ATENOLOL: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse effects have been mild and transient. The frequency estimates in the following table were derived from controlled studies in 
hypertensive patients in which adverse reactions were either volunteered by the patient (US studies) or elicited, e.g., by checklist (foreign studies). The reported frequency of elicited adverse 
effects was higher for both atenolol and placebo-treated patients than when these reactions were volunteered. Where frequency of adverse effects of atenolol and placebo is similar, causal relationship
to atenolol is uncertain. Volunteered ( US Studies ) Total-Volunteered and Elicited ( Foreign + US Studies ) Atenolol (n = 164) % Placebo (n = 206) % Atenolol (n = 399) % Placebo (n = 407) %

ANSWER: Atenolol, when used in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality. In a 
multicenter clinical trial (ISIS-1) involving 16,027 patients, the vascular mortality rates were 3.89% in the atenolol group compared to 4.57% in the control group, translating into a statistically 
significant proportional reduction of 15%. This suggests that atenolol can decrease the risk of hospitalization and mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction by improving survival rates. 
However, it is important to note that good clinical judgment is required, as patients who are dependent on sympathetic stimulation for maintaining adequate cardiac output and blood pressure are not 
good candidates for beta-blockade, and the trial excluded patients with blood pressure consistently below 100 mm Hg systolic.

        Question: Does ATENOLOL increase or decrease the risk of hospitalization?
        -----
        Reasoning:
        1. I asked FDAHandler whether ATENOLOL increases or decreases the risk of hospitalization.
2. FDAHandler responded that Atenolol, when used in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction, has been shown to reduce cardiovascular 
mortality according to a multicenter clinical trial (ISIS-1).
3. The trial indicated a statistically significant proportional reduction of 15% in vascular mortality rates in the atenolol group compared to the control group, suggesting that atenolol can decrease 
the risk of hospitalization and mortality associated with acute myocardial infarction by improving survival rates.
4. However, it was noted that good clinical judgment is required, as patients who are dependent on sympathetic stimulation for maintaining adequate cardiac output and blood pressure are not good 
candidates for beta-blockade, and the trial excluded patients with blood pressure consistently below 100 mm Hg systolic.
        -----
        Final answer: Atenolol has been shown to decrease the risk of hospitalization in the context of managing hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction 
by reducing cardiovascular mortality, as evidenced by the ISIS-1 clinical trial.

Atenolol has been shown to decrease the risk of hospitalization specifically in the context of managing hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction by 
reducing cardiovascular mortality, as evidenced by the ISIS-1 clinical trial. This evidence does not necessarily generalize to all uses of Atenolol or to all patient populations.
