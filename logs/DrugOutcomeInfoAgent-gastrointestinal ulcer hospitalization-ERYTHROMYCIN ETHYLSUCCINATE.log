[32mThe question asked was whether ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE increases or decreases the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. I attempted to obtain information from FDAHandler using the [0m
[32mrecipient_message tool to inquire about the effects of ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. However, there was no response from FDAHandler, which means [0m
[32mthere is no information available from the FDA label data to determine the effect of ERYTHROMYCIN ETHYLSUCCINATE on the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. Therefore, the final answer is [0m
[32mDO-NOT-KNOW.[0m
