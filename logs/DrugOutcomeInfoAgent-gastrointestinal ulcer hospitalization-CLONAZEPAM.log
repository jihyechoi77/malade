        Below are some relevant extracts for your query:
        -----
        
CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Instruct breastfeeding patients who take clonazepam tablets to monitor their infants for excessive sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical 
attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ). Concomitant Medication: Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any 
prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for interactions. Alcohol: Patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking clonazepam tablets. Drug Interactions: Effect of 
Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines and Opioids: The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the 
CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA A sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the 
potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients 
closely for respiratory depression and sedation. Effect of Clonazepam on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs: Clonazepam does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine or 
phenobarbital. Clonazepam has the potential to influence concentrations of phenytoin. Monitoring of phenytoin concentration is recommended when clonazepam is co-administrated with phenytoin. The 
effect of clonazepam on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated. Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Clonazepam: Literature reports suggest that ranitidine, an agent that 
decreases stomach acidity, does not greatly alter clonazepam pharmacokinetics. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and 
without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the C max of clonazepam was 20% lower when the 
orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 
inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Cytochrome P-450 inducers, such as 
phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been 
performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used 
cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated concentrations and effects. CLONAZEPAM: precautions: Pharmacodynamic 
Interactions: The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, 
thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, 
Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with clonazepam. Mutagenesis The data currently available are not sufficient to determine the genotoxic 
potential of clonazepam.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages, and 
those who have had longer durations of use. Acute Withdrawal Reactions The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. 
Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam tablets after continued use, or administration of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, 
which can be life-threatening (e.g., seizures) (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ) . Protracted Withdrawal Syndrome In some cases, benzodiazepine users have developed a protracted withdrawal 
syndrome with withdrawal symptoms lasting weeks to more than 12 months (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ). CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Since 
clonazepam tablets produce CNS depression, patients receiving this drug should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness, such as operating machinery or driving
a motor vehicle. They should also be warned about the concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS-depressant drugs during clonazepam tablets therapy (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions and PRECAUTIONS: 
Information for Patients ). Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including clonazepam tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs 
for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood
or behavior. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had 
approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment 
duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43% compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an
increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated 
patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as
one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal
thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs
of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the
clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1. CLONAZEPAM: warnings: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled 
Analysis Indication Placebo Drug Patients Relative Risk: Risk Difference: Patients with with Events Per Incidence of Additional Drug Events Per 1000 Patients Events in Drug Patients with 1000 Patients
Patients/Incidence Events per 1000 in Placebo Patients Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts
or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric 
indications.

CONTENT: CLONAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). The use of benzodiazepines, 
including clonazepam tablets, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. CLONAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing clonazepam tablets and 
throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ) . The continued use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam tablets, may lead to clinically 
significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam 
tablets after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue clonazepam tablets
or reduce the dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .

uninformative, and events reported only once and which did not have a substantial probability of being acutely life-threatening. CLONAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: It is important to emphasize that, 
although the events occurred during treatment with clonazepam tablets, they were not necessarily caused by it. Events are further categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing

The FDA label for CLONAZEPAM does not specifically mention an increase or decrease in the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. While the label includes various precautions, warnings, and 
adverse reactions associated with clonazepam, it does not explicitly mention gastrointestinal ulcers requiring hospitalization. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, we cannot determine 
whether CLONAZEPAM affects the risk of gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization.
