[31mtherapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. [0m
[31mRetrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. [0m

[31mincreased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most [0m
[31mtrials included in the analysis did not extend beyond [0m[1;31m24[0m[31m weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond [0m[1;31m24[0m[31m weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally[0m
[31mconsistent among drugs in the data analyzed. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk [0m

[31mincreased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most [0m
[31mtrials included in the analysis did not extend beyond [0m[1;31m24[0m[31m weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond [0m[1;31m24[0m[31m weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally[0m
[31mconsistent among drugs in the data analyzed. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk [0m

[31mHyponatremia can occur as a result of treatment with carbamazepine extended-release capsules. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic [0m

[31mlead to falls. Consider discontinuing carbamazepine extended-release capsules in patients with symptomatic hyponatremia. Usage in Pregnancy Carbamazepine can cause fetal harm when administered to a [0m
[31mpregnant woman. CARBAMAZEPINE: warnings: Epidemiological data suggest that there may be an association between the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy and congenital malformations, including spina [0m
[31mbifida. There have also been reports that associate carbamazepine with developmental disorders and congenital anomalies [0m[1;31m([0m[31me.g., craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, and anomalies [0m
[31minvolving various body systems[0m[1;31m)[0m[31m. Developmental delays have been reported. When treating or counseling women of childbearing potential, the prescribing physician will wish to weigh the benefits of [0m
[31mtherapy against the risks. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. [0m
[31mRetrospective case reviews suggest that, compared with monotherapy, there may be a higher prevalence of teratogenic effects associated with the use of anticonvulsants in combination therapy. [0m
[31mTherefore, if therapy is to be continued, monotherapy may be preferable for pregnant women.         [0m
