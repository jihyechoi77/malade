[34mThe question was whether haloperidol increases or decreases the risk of bleeding. I asked FDAHandler for information regarding the effects of haloperidol on bleeding risk. FDAHandler responded with [0m
[34mDO-NOT-KNOW, which means that the FDA label for haloperidol does not specify any information about its impact on bleeding risk. Therefore, based on the available FDA label data, it is not possible to [0m
[34mdetermine whether haloperidol has an effect on bleeding risk. The absence of information in the FDA label suggests that there may not be a known or established effect, or that it has not been [0m

[34mleukocytosis, and mentions that other antipsychotic drugs have been associated with conditions like agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia, which could [0m
[34mtheoretically affect bleeding risk. Nonetheless, a direct causal relationship between THIOTHIXENE and bleeding risk is not established in the label.[0m
