CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: ADVERSE REACTIONS Most adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including CNS effects and respiratory depression, are dose dependent, with more severe effects 
occurring with high doses. In a sample of about 3500 patients treated for anxiety, the most frequent adverse reaction to lorazepam was sedation (15.9%), followed by dizziness (6.9%), weakness (4.2%), 
and unsteadiness (3.4%). The incidence of sedation and unsteadiness increased with age. LORAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: Other adverse reactions to benzodiazepines, including lorazepam are fatigue, 
drowsiness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion, disorientation, depression, unmasking of depression, disinhibition, euphoria, suicidal ideation/attempt, ataxia, asthenia, extrapyramidal symptoms, 
convulsions/seizures, tremor, vertigo, eye function/visual disturbance (including diplopia and blurred vision), dysarthria/slurred speech, change in libido, impotence, decreased orgasm; headache, 
coma; respiratory depression, apnea, worsening of sleep apnea, worsening of obstructive pulmonary disease; gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, change in appetite, constipation, jaundice, 
increase in bilirubin, increase in liver transaminases, increase in alkaline phosphatase; hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactoid reactions; dermatological symptoms, allergic skin reactions, 
alopecia; syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic LORAZEPAM: adverse_reactions: hormone (SIADH), hyponatremia; thrombocytopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia; hypothermia; and autonomic 
manifestations. Paradoxical reactions, including anxiety, excitation, agitation, hostility, aggression, rage, sleep disturbances/insomnia, sexual arousal, and hallucinations may occur. Small decreases
in blood pressure and hypotension may occur but are usually not clinically significant, probably being related to the relief of anxiety produced by lorazepam. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS,

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the
majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not 
confirmed these findings. Animal Data Reproductive studies in animals were performed in mice, rats, and two strains of rabbits. Occasional anomalies (reduction of tarsals, tibia, metatarsals, 
malrotated limbs, gastroschisis, malformed skull, and microphthalmia) were seen in drug-treated rabbits without relationship to dosage. Although all of these anomalies were not present in the 
concurrent control group, they have been reported to occur randomly in historical controls. At doses of 40 mg/kg and higher, there was evidence of fetal resorption and increased fetal loss in rabbits 
which was not seen at lower doses. LORAZEPAM: precautions: Nursing Mothers Risk Summary Lorazepam is present in breast milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants
exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. The effects of lorazepam on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the 
mother’s clinical need for lorazepam and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from lorazepam or from the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to 
lorazepam through breast milk should be monitored for sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of lorazepam generally were not adequate to determine whether subjects
aged 65 and over respond differently than younger subjects; however, the incidence of sedation and unsteadiness was observed to increase with age (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Age does not appear to have 
a significant effect on lorazepam kinetics (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). LORAZEPAM: precautions: Clinical circumstances, some of which may be more common in the elderly, such as hepatic or renal 
impairment, should be considered. Greater sensitivity (e.g., sedation) of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, and lower 
doses may be sufficient in these patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: drug_interactions: Drug Interactions The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites 
in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA A sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for 
benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for 
respiratory depression and sedation. The benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, produce increased CNS-depressant effects when administered with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates, 
antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, sedative antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics. LORAZEPAM: drug_interactions: Concomitant use of 
clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium, and respiratory arrest. Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate results in 
increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate. Concurrent administration of lorazepam 
with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% 
when coadministered with probenecid. The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation. Administration of theophylline or aminophylline may reduce the 
sedative effects of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam.

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: precautions: Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy (see PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy
). Nursing Instruct patients to notify their healthcare provider if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Instruct breastfeeding patients using lorazepam to monitor infants for excessive 
sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain, and to seek medical attention if they notice these signs (see PRECAUTIONS: Nursing Mothers ). Essential Laboratory Tests Some patients on lorazepam have 
developed leukopenia, and some have had elevations of LDH. As with other benzodiazepines, periodic blood counts and liver function tests are recommended for patients on long-term therapy. Drug

benzodiazepines, including lorazepam. Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis No evidence of carcinogenic potential emerged in rats during an 18-month study with lorazepam. No studies regarding mutagenesis 
have been performed. LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to psychiatric medications, including 
lorazepam, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at 
https://womensmentalhealth.org/pregnancyregistry/. Risk Summary Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal 
withdrawal (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome and Clinical Considerations ). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do 
not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All 
pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. LORAZEPAM: pregnancy: general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage 
in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory 
depression, hypotonia and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor 
neonates exposed to lorazepam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (see WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome ). Data Human Data Published data 
from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects.

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: warnings: WARNINGS Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Concomitant use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory 
depression, coma, and death. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Observational studies have 
demonstrated that concomitant use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug-related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. If a decision is made to prescribe lorazepam 
concomitantly with opioids, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use, and follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. 
In patients already receiving an opioid analgesic, prescribe a lower initial dose of lorazepam than indicated in the absence of an opioid and titrate based on clinical response. LORAZEPAM: warnings: 
If an opioid is initiated in a patient already taking lorazepam, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid and titrate based upon clinical response. Advise both patients and caregivers about the 
risks of respiratory depression and sedation when lorazepam is used with opioids. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use with the opioid have been
determined (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction The use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, exposes users to the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can 
lead to overdose or death. LORAZEPAM: warnings: Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve 
concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or 
death (see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Abuse ). Before prescribing lorazepam and throughout treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g., using a standardized screening 
tool). Use of lorazepam, particularly in patients at elevated risk, necessitates counseling about the risks and proper use of lorazepam along with monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, 
and addiction. Prescribe the lowest effective dosage; avoid or minimize concomitant use of CNS depressants and other substances associated with abuse, misuse, and addiction (e.g.

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: boxed_warning: WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS • Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and 
opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. 
Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ). • The use of benzodiazepines, 
including lorazepam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other 
medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. LORAZEPAM: boxed_warning: Before prescribing lorazepam and throughout 
treatment, assess each patient’s risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction (see WARNINGS ). • The continued use of benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, may lead to clinically significant physical 
dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of lorazepam after continued use may 
precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue lorazepam or reduce the dosage ( DOSAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ).

CONTENT: LORAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Lorazepam tablets are administered orally. For optimal results, dose, frequency of administration, and duration of therapy 
should be individualized according to patient response. To facilitate this, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, and 2 mg tablets are available. The usual range is 2 to 6 mg/day given in divided doses, the largest dose 
being taken before bedtime, but the daily dosage may vary from 1 to 10 mg/day. For anxiety, most patients require an initial dose of 2 to 3 mg/day given two times a day or three times a day. For 
insomnia due to anxiety or transient situational stress, a single daily dose of 2 to 4 mg may be given, usually at bedtime. For elderly or debilitated patients, an initial dosage of 1 to 2 mg/day in 
divided doses is recommended, to be adjusted as needed and tolerated. LORAZEPAM: dosage_and_administration: The dosage of lorazepam tablets should be increased gradually when needed to help avoid 
adverse effects. When higher dosage is indicated, the evening dose should be increased before the daytime doses. Discontinuation or Dosage Reduction of Lorazepam Tablets To reduce the risk of 
withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue lorazepam tablets or reduce the dosage. If a patient develops withdrawal reactions, consider pausing the taper or increasing the dosage to the 
previous tapered dosage level. Subsequently decrease the dosage more slowly (see WARNINGS: Dependence and Withdrawal Reactions and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Dependence ).
