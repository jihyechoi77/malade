Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors like lisinopril is associated with an increased risk of changes in renal function, including acute renal failure.

Drug THIOTHIXENE: I have attempted to retrieve information regarding the effect of thiothixene on the risk of renal failure from the FDAHandler multiple times, but have not received any information. This suggests that the FDA label for thiothixene does not specify whether it increases or decreases the risk of renal failure. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to your question based on FDA label data. \n\nThe lack of information in the FDA label could mean that there is no established effect, or that it has not been sufficiently studied or reported to warrant inclusion in the label. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider for the most personalized and up-to-date information regarding medication risks and benefits. \n\n DO-NOT-KNOW\n3. Drug PIMOZIDE: The FDA label for PIMOZIDE does not indicate that it increases the risk of renal failure. However, it does note that Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a rare but potentially fatal condition sometimes associated with antipsychotic drugs, can include acute renal failure among its complications.
